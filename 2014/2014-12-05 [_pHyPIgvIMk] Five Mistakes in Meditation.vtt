00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 The five mistakes, errors of the meditations. These are things I have mentioned before to you, but

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 maybe not this time, but I will take these.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.010
 Again, I think maybe we covered those things during these teachings, but first is the meditation or

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 the practice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 It's not just a meditation practice, it's laziness. The first number one is laziness.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Second obstacle is forget instructions. Also that means forget the principle instructions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Maybe you did a lot of instructions teaching, but we have to remember the principle instructions.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:00.810
 So, forget the instructions. Now, when we don't have the laziness, when we didn't forget the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.000
 principle instructions, now we begin to meditate.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 May it be meditating or the practices. Now, first obstacle, what comes during the meditation? There

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.000
 are two obstacles that we all know.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.820
 Those are known as in the Tibetan world, Summa and Gopas. Summa means, if I translated that, just

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.000
 as it is, sinking mind. Sinking.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And Gopas means wild, busy. These two are the principle obstacles during our practices.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:01.970
 That means that we didn't have the laziness, we were very energetic, began to sit down on the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.000
 cushion or on the chair. That's why we sit on the chair and cushion.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 Although we didn't forget the principle instructions, we had good postures, good styles, all

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.000
 aspects, and sitting there. So, we didn't forget.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.830
 Now, we are meditating or we practice. During the meditation, during the practices, these are two

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.000
 obstacles.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:43.450
 Every practice passes, everyone. This is sinking mind and busy-ness mind. If I use the word sinking

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.000
 mind in a different way, darkness.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 That is the sinking mind, it's the very word, Summa.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.190
 Summa. And that also then leads, what? That dozing-ness, that darkness, that sinking mind, lead, we

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.000
 fall asleep, feeling sleepy.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.260
 Then, now you are sitting on the beautiful cushion or in the chair and the rest of you didn't

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.000
 forget, but now we fall asleep.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 Which is good, yes, but we fall asleep. But what it is, that will prevent our growth, growth of the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.000
 progress of the meditation.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 So they are disturbed. And then busy-ness, our mind is begin. There is many different levels of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.000
 also busy-ness, very become wild, emotions are disturbing.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.440
 The past emotions or the memories of the past or the present or future thought, anxiety, all that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.000
 kind of completely become so much turbulence, that's the very kind of big busy-ness.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.290
 And then wandering generally cannot just rest, but nothing too much, big emotions, almost kind of

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.000
 neutral status.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And just without really any reasons, without any big deals, that mind is not wandering.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Wondering just like almost become what dear dreamers, kind of just dear dreamers, just that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.720
 Whatever that is, whether it's yesterday, whether it's kind of nice appealing thoughts, or whether

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.000
 it's kind of just air, very air, regular thoughts.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Whatever, but it distracts the mind, it really distracts the mind.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.880
 And then in a small busy-ness, it's kind of almost under currents, under currents, busy-ness

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.000
 thoughts.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 That's something that even you maybe didn't notice, almost.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.900
 That mongol with dousiness, dousiness, and then you're wondering that, isn't it? In the Buddha

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.000
 teaching said, "napto honju".

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.520
 It's something that under currents, under currents, it looks like on the surface level, good, nice

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.000
 and good, but then under currents of the thoughts are disturbing.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.390
 Even that is, no matter whatever, it is disturbing for the progress of our practices, our

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.000
 progressive practices.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.490
 So therefore, during the meditation and practices, we always try to remember that this, whatever

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.000
 that is, it is a disturbance.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 It slows down our progress. It slows down our real possessions.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Then, also, overall, our practice has not become good qualities.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.900
 Maybe it's good conscious level, good, one hour, two hours, or half hour, whatever, conscious level

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.000
, maybe you're really doing that, but call it a level, it's not good.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.180
 Therefore, to make call it, for those reasons, what the great Master, Gaurav Amma Samba said in

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.000
 teaching, "teaching, make short breaks, short time, good call it".

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 This is one of his, of course, other teachings, great Master says one after another in one voice.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 But Gaurav Amma Samba said he gave the instructions to the queen of came mother example.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.950
 Mother example was Chisholm's son, and when Gaurav Amma Samba gave the instructions, she asked how

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.000
 to meditate, Gaurav Amma Samba said,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.130
 "Yuntong dhaan yung taun mein khaajong tupala" in Tibet, so that's great technique that Gaurav Amma

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.000
 Samba used many times.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 What does that mean? Short time, many times, as leaking water from old house.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.250
 That means, maybe you didn't see old house, but when you see old house, in the east I see, many

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.000
 times old house are not really good maintaining,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.130
 wind is rain, water stays up there, and then just even the sun is shining outside, this water is

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.000
 leaking.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.320
 Not too much at one time, just continually, just one, one, one. This is called old empty house that

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.000
 is leaking, leaking.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Gaurav Amma Samba used example with that house, that house.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.250
 And what is it? Many times, in short time, will be good qualities. Then it's very beautiful, very

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.000
 meaningful, perfect. Short time or good qualities.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.130
 Meditate is really good. You keep up. You didn't forget the instructions. When you meditate, keep

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.000
 that anxiety, the instructions on which we went through.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 It's cognitive, awareness, emptiness, inseparably, fresh, carefree, self-linear and technical.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Apply that in a short time, many times, whatever you can do, it will bring progress.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 When your mind is settled, when our mind is beginning to settle nicely, then we can do long time.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Long time meditating, then it becomes bigger and better, wider and deeper.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And with this, with this meditation, then what things need? Next one.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Next one is two things, water or the sinking and the booziness of mind.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.690
 Next day, there's another two, two mozz. This is, now next day, apply, we need to need, apply the

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:18.000
 antidote or too much, no sorry, not apply the antidote and apply too much antidote.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.600
 This is the two, again. So that means that we need apply the techniques, techniques during

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.000
 meditation practices but also with balance.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.630
 Not too much and also not too little. Just the right, just the right. Balance, that is what we need

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.000
.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.460
 When the antidote or even is something, practice, teachings, teachings, when you have, remember,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.000
 when you didn't forget the instruction, when you don't have a lady in there,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.110
 you're keeping apart from the meditation with all the obstacles or the handiness of this sinking in

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.000
 the wireless, then we have to relax.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 We don't have to think too many things about the teachings. Just rest with confidence, with joy.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.340
 But if you need it, you're going to apply that. Apply that. Too much antidote or too much thinking

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.000
 of these and that things, even is good, even is teaching.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 This, it will slow down, okay? Slow down and then you become too external.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.540
 And to also lose, not applying, kind of like apply the technique and the teaching there, you know,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.000
 remember and just kind of like keep doing that, that also will slow down.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So therefore, not too little and not too much, apply, just right and then move forward.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Then, continuity. That is what practice teaches it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Wherever we do this, then what comes? All those signs, all those experiences will come up.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.130
 And we've continually, as great mass pointed here, those blasphemous experiences, clarity

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.000
 experiences and neutral experience, all that comes.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Those are good signs of the good achievements, but those are not final goals.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 They are the dawn of the enlightenment, dawn of the realizations.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 They are like, but this is not realization, it is self.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Self, we have to move. We have, and not grasping, not cling.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Those are the teaching here, mentioned.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 In the teaching, all these teaching, here is very long teachings, and we start grasping.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Grasping, any of those, the dawn of the enlightenment, then it makes again, handless.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.890
 Because attachment, this attachment, no matter whatever that attachment is, whether even it is good

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.000
, it is attachment.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 For that reason, what is teaching? All these teachings, on the post meditation level,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.730
 could have the devotion and joy and appreciation and bodhic and all that, all those beautiful

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.000
 things bring up in post meditation.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 But when you come to the meditation of the Sahaja or the Dzogi or the Mahamudar status,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 you just let it merge, everything in the natural status.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.530
 We are not going to think of any of those, we are going to maintain that precious status, this

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.000
 cognitive,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 everless, emptiness status. We are going to maintain that status.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.710
 And once in a while, during those times, in the teaching said, during meditation, we can bring up

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.000
 again love and compassion,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 joy and everything is like magical display. Those thoughts just for a moment bring up that.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 But let those also dissolve back to the source, where those all beautiful thoughts came.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:11.050
 From that, from that meaning, from that cognitive awareness or rupa and emptiness status, all that

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.000
 came from it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.730
 Let that merge back to that status and continue to fly, keep continue flying in that space of inner

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.000
 space.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 There is no boundaries, there is no limitations, there is no territories.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:36.410
 Pre-everything, keep continuous, with joy in every occasion as said, devotion, and keep continuing

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.000
 that.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.620
 And otherwise, if anything kind of signs and indications or those qualities come up, every start of

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.000
 grasping,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 that's the great must point out in this book, you have the books.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 And all those errors, mistakes will lead us, we will dilute to the dilute, dilute the status.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And then every verse, more clanging, grasping, what is the teaching said?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.700
 Every grasping more about the blissfulness, experience, that will lead us to take rebirth back to

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.000
 the desire, desirings.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Every more grasping to the clarity aspect of the experience, it will take us back to the formless.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.990
 Every grasping to the neutral state of the mind, that experience, that is, take us to the formless

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.000
 things.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 What are those? It's then samsara. Again, almost we can't relate, may come back to the samsara.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 We like to release the cause of samsara.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.490
 Samsara is fine according to the Mahayana, or the Mahayana, or the Vedayana teaching, it's a vital

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.000
 status.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 But we don't like to stay in samsara as samsara beings, as samsara citizens.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 We don't like to be as citizens of samsara, in samsara.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.910
 We like to stay in samsara, but not as like subject and kind of tied up by the samsara as samsara

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.000
 beings.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 That, it will lead us back to that status, this status.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 For that reason, all, every great master is teaching, and the Buddha, everything, said, no grasp.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.600
 And again, for those reasons, one of the great teachers in the Tibetan Buddhism is from Satya

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.000
 schools of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 known as Japa Jamsim. He's very famous. He's one of the great masters of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 and he's also co-founder of the Satya schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 There's five great Satya masters came in the same family in ancient time,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 in the 11th century, or toward the end of 10th century, 11th century.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Five great masters, just one after another, really great, five great masters.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Those are known as Kunga Himpo, Trava Jamsim, and Sohana Cemu.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Three, and then Satya Pendeta, and Rombu Chuyang Pappas.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Manetana said, three white, three ordinary, two ordinary ones.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Three white ones, and two red ones, so they say.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Three white ones, two red ones, all together five great masters, Satya schools.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Three white ones, that's not us, they are not us, they are practitioners, not us.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And two white, red ones are Satya Pendeta, who is the great master,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 who visited Jangasan's god or royal teacher for the Jangish Kams, Jangish Kams.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 And then, second one is Chuyang Pappas, Rombu Chuyang Pappas,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 who become the, again, royal guru for the Kublakkams, Kublakkams.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 These both are knowns, both are known, therefore they say, two red ones.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 But among that, the three Mappas, Trava Jamsim, is the one, the very famous masters.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And he, in one of his teachings said, if you have the grasping, grasping, that is not you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Actually, Manjushri spoke to him, spoke that.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 In Zambar Sanathav, if there is a grasping, that is not you.
