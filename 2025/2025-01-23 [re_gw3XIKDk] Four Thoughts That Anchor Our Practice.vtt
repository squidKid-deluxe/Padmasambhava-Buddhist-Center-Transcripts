00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 We went through this page nine, basically page nine. Nine of these, and now what we will discuss.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Until now, and yesterday, we discussed among the two groups of the practice of meditation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 The first one is the Shammata meditation, and the second is the Vajrayana meditation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Shammata meditation is coming down the mind,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 and coming down the mind of all the busyness, consumption, and emotions, and thought.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Mind is always busy, wonder if the mind is running, and where is it running?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 On the third of the five senses, the object is all five, six senses.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Those are eye senses, object-to-eye senses, object-of-the-air senses, object-of-a-nose,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 object-room, tone, and the body, and the mind. It's running all the time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Where is it running? It's also running all the time outside.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Exhaling, wondering every direction, all that, and looking, and searching, and craving.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Treving, and with the kind of hope, and the fears.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 That's what the mind has been doing all the time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Where there is a big, gross level, big level, small level, that's what.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Mind becomes very restless status, always.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And so now, what Shammata means, bring mind back.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Settle into yourself, looking inwardly, not just in caring all the time outside.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Bring inwardly.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And that is when we went through the gracious teacher,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Buddha Sakyama, and his varieties of those mindful practices, Shama, the meditations.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 We went through with it, whole, renal cycle thought.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And also, we went really, the whole mindfulness practices.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Whole, renal cycle thought, this is the name of the whole, renal cycle thought,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 but it is mindfulness practices.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 We are collecting those, each point, with mind, it's already going there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It was coming down our mind, and secondly, our mind.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 It is part of mindfulness practices.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Same time, it was entering down ourselves on the ground of the nature where it belongs.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Otherwise, we're carried the post by all those distractions of mainly six senses, objects.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 All coming carried by that post, out all the time.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And that is then carried with mingali, joined with hope and faith, all the time.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So now, we're kind of brain coming back, suddenly gone, looking thoroughly of these systems.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 This whole renal cycle or whole point of change,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 point that will change the attitude of the grasping, cling of samsara,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 it's not just a kind of Buddhist toma or Buddhist way, only Buddhist thing.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 This is the way the nature is.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 That's the way that the samsara or the situation in our, we are.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 British life, we discuss them. That's not just Buddhism.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Whether you're a Buddhist or a non-Buddhist or a believer or a non-believer,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 everyone's life is precious. Everyone has a life.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Life is precious to everyone.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Not just only the human beings, animals.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 All the beings, what does the gracious teacher Buddha both broad understand,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 not partiality, only the human beings, only this group.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 The whole base has same.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Life is precious to everyone.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Then we discuss it with our second mindfulness practice.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 We discuss it about the impermanent.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 A impermanent is not just a Buddhist, followers. Everyone is best on that.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Whether you're believer, non-believer, Buddhist, non-Buddhist.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 But Buddhist, what Buddhism is doing here is looking through the nature,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 not just ignoring, not looking in the other directions,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 looking to where we belong, where we stand, what we are.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Totally examine, get meaningful from that situation.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Not just security the pulse of the naive and kind of like distracted

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 and then ignore.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 So the second is impermanent. Third is cause and effect systems.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 That again is not just Buddhism.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Everyone, whether you are believer or non-believer,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 everyone has same things. Everyone goes through.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Cause and effect are so important and that's what we all best.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Everything is best on that cause and effect,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 which is sometimes, with the Buddha teaching, name the karma.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Karma is more connected with mentally that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Mentally connected and it is action.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Action of the mind, what produced and carried that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 That's what's called karma. But externally everything is also that karma too.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 All the growth of breath plants, seed, when you plant the seed,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 if you put nice conditions in the soil, your brain grows.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 If you didn't plant that seed, you will see it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 If you didn't plant that seed correctly or you didn't take care of that plant

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 by the conditions and fertilizers, it won't bring the result.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 That's the karma of the outside. It's done. Same thing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 So that is what we are left with.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Exactly to the cause and conditions and the result.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Everyone likes to have happy and joy and peaceful.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Jews are communicating, gathering the cause that will bring more happy,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 more peace, more joy to our son, to the others.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And if we don't care if we have the happiness and peaceful,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 then do the action, what will be counteractive with emotions.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Anger, ghettos, hatred, hopes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Then we embrace and release head and sufferings to our son, to the others.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Ask our son if it's true or not.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 This is not just the buddhist and the domo.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Always reflecting that truth, be productive.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Be a common sense, sensible.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Make more meaningful.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And more for more, well, we have this beautiful time.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Well, we say this beautiful time, we're not threatening.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Our buddhist is not threatening.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It's whether we see that by word or not.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Time is limited.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Time is not just going to wait us.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Waiting us is true.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And so be smart to take the opportunity.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Be smart to take the opportunity.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 For example, spring is not going to wait for us.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Whatever we have to do in the springtime, have to do.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 If you like to get the result that did something in springtime,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 you do progress in the summer, in the autumn.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 You have to do.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Spring will not wait us.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 No summer will not wait us.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Time is going to be smart and use.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Follow the example of the farmers.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 I mean, farmers are not going to wait to plant the seeds and all that.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Do the right time.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Similarly, use the time, be smart.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Cause an effort.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And then the samsara has a lot of receptive factors.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 The world has so many receptive factors.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 No matter what your is, even you're the weakest person,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 still not comfortable, still not happy.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 And the poor is a person, also not happy.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And average people, also not satisfactory.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Always goes ups and downs.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 And we rely externally, every day.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 There's no permanent happiness solutions.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Peaceful solutions outside.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 For that reason, gracious teacher, brother Chakramani,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 and all those great masters who follow that path,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 said, change your mind.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 If you like to get happiness, change your mind.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 If you don't like suffering, change your mind.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Make the change from our mind, not mind of the others.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Others.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And the samsara, they samsara what?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 When you do that, are we able to do that?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 What is the teaching said?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Samsara is nirvana.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Samsara is a pure land.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Samsara is heaven.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Heaven is not ours, so we have to go.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Yeah.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Samsara, heaven is right here.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Right here.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 How why?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Because it's discovered from the mind.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 It's that.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 That's what we really went to.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 All practices are mindfulness practices.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Many changes.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 When you practice this, that's what all the practice,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 lineage masters, all the human masters,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 all the kajim masters, as well as all the Buddhist masters,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 really mention this four point change is the anchor.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Anchor of the practices.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Anchor is a dome.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 What that means is the anchor.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 We are plotting by the destruction of the samsara.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Deceiving.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 This mind is so unstable.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And obviously the five senses or six senses are so deceiving.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 It's carried.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 We're plotting.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 We're unstable, restless.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 But when we have this four point, what is thought?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 It was anchor dome.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 More subtle, more stable, more sensible, more common sense,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 more smart, more really practical.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Practical.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Even in the great masters, in the teaching that we make of it,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 this is not just a once in a while thing,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 this four thoughts, not just once in a while,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 but every thing that every beginner practices,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 that practice will come so beautifully.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Beautiful.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 We make more anchor, more sensible practices.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 So those that it isn't here, great master.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And then along with that, we went through the four minds

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 from his practice.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Those yester, those all [INAUDIBLE] meditation.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Really focused in coming dome.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And talking with the [INAUDIBLE] meditation,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 many of you, you or we know, we heard that many times.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 many times.
