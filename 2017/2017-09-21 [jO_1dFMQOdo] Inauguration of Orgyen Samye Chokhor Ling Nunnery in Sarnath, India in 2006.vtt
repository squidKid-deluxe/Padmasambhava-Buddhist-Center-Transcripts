NOTE     "synopsis": "Inauguration of Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling Nunnery in Sarnath, India in 2006\n\n\"Now and throughout the history of Buddhism, there have been many monasteries in Deer Park, but Orgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling is the first nunnery on this holy land. Establishing this beautiful nunnery is a historical achievement that is the fulfillment of the diligent work, kindness, and aspiration prayers of many people. We pray that this is not only a singular historical event, but that it will become a special starting point that will begin a new chapter in the history of Buddhism in Deer Park. We hope that it will deeply inspire the resident nuns on their path of knowledge, wisdom and compassion, and immediately benefit all women and all of humanity for many generations to come.\"\n\n-The Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches\n\nOrgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling Nunnery was established by Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche under the auspices of Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, and is guided by Lama Jomo Lorraine to spiritually and intellectually nurture Tibetan women.  Through the Venerable Rinpoches\u2019 kindness they created both a religious and secular educational opportunity for the nuns that is free from gender bias. The education provided supports the Dharma, affords independence, and guarantees the preservation of Tibetan culture through religion, philosophy, and language. Through the generous support of benefactors, it is the wishes of the Ven. Rinpoches to further develop the educational experiences for the nuns of Orgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling as a way to uphold the authentic Nyingma lineages of Tibet.\n\nLocation\n\nOrgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling is the first Buddhist nunnery located at historic Deer Park in the holy city of Sarnath, India.  Deer Park was the location that Buddha Shakyamuni gave his first teaching on the Four Noble Truths.  The nunnery is located on four acres of land which is ornamented with beautiful fruit trees and flowers, and is only a short walk from the Rinpoches\u2019 monastery: Padma Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling.  \n \nHistory\n\nOrgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling opened in March 2003.  The nunnery was completed and consecrated in November 2006, reflecting the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches\u2019 commitment to provide equal education for both men and women. Women have historically played a significant role in helping to uphold many Dharma lineages in Tibet. By establishing the first Buddhist nunnery in the holy land of Sarnath, the Ven. Khenpo Rinpoches have created a wonderful opportunity for female practitioners to lead a very meaningful and fruitful life as they deepen their knowledge of the Dharma, and learn important skills to help others.\n \nFacilities\n\nThe nunnery is a beautiful there-story structure that includes a large formal temple, a library filled with thousands of books, individual rooms for resident nuns, four spacious apartments and many single and double rooms that can be rented by Buddhist pilgrims, a large dining hall, various offices, and private quarters for the Khenpo Rinpoches.  There is one computer with internet access at the nunnery.\n\nEducation\n\nThe nuns receive a formal secular and religious education that is the same as that of the monks at Padma Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling.\nAs many of the entering nuns cannot read or write, their education begins with the basics: reading, writing, grammar, and learning lineage chants. They all receive a solid academic foundation including art, three languages (Tibetan, English, and Hindi), philosophy, and the principles of the bodhisattva life.  From the ritual master, they learn and practice Tibetan Buddhist ritual, ceremony, and meditation. Unlike the monks, the nuns\u2019 training also includes the additional practice of Ch\u00f6d. The nuns perform Ch\u00f6d every evening with hand drums, bells, and traditional chants and melodies.\n\nOrgyen Samye Chokhor Ling\nNyingma Buddhist Nunnery\nSarnath, Varanasi\nwww.PBCIndia.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660
 [Music]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.960
 [Music]

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.440
 Good morning and welcome everyone. This is one of the very

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.240
 glorious and beautiful day of the Buddhist history.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.840
 Certainly is for us one of the great moment in our life. We are celebrating the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.680
 very special significance of the event that marks

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 one of the beautiful history in the Buddhist history

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.440
 in this holy land of the Saranath or the way the Buddha forced to give

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:26.800
 the will of dharma, or the turning the will of dharma.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.400
 [Music]

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.000
 The nunnery is very important. We really thought that because

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 in the holy land, such it is a holy land, there is no

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.000
 nunneries in history that we can read happened.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 The first nunnery in Saranath in history after

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:17.760
 the two thousand five hundred fiftyth Buddha's birthday.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 There hasn't been a nunnery a year since the time of the Buddha.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
 They've at least documented that there was a community of female practitioners

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.880
 here. So Rinpoche's have dedicated this to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 to the continued learning, the teachings for the female communities

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.000
 that they receive and hold the teachings and bring

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 bring them to maturity both in the practice meditation and study.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 The three aspects, three pillars of Buddhism.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.880
 In the according to the Buddha's teaching, teaching the nunnery started

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 in the shavastha but nothing really mentioned in this holy land. There's a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.360
 lot of monasteries mentioned but nothing nunnery. So we thought if we can

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:05.680
 start it some nunnery it will be really wonderful.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.840
 Asanda is the day of our opening nunnery.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 Many of the peoples are coming to come into our openings.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.160
 Women's lineage into that Buddhism is really, really important.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160
 Most of them I know, most realized, pictures will be doing practices of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.120
 female deities. It's just it's very integrated and very

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.400
 important and that was the basis for wanting to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.760
 or aspiring to because we didn't know that it would be possible

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.040
 but we aspire to bring women into the arena

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.800
 and to carry the lineage forward.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.000
 Now we have about eight nuns.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.280
 My name is Sandy. I am from Nepal. I am 11 years old.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 I am Bemur Weasel. I am from Nepal. I am 16 years old.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.440
 I am Thas Yangtian. I am 16 years old. I am from Sikkim.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.720
 I am Chiki. I am 20 years old. I am from Bhutan.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.680
 My name is Dronma Chiki. I am from Nepal. I am a pediatrician.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.480
 I am 20 and 20 years old. I am from Nepal. And they all generally they they own

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.760
 interest. They become really nuns. My mission is to become a nun.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.360
 By being a nun I want to retreat a lot and I want to study more about

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.920
 the philosophy and as well as the Tibetan grammars

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.080
 because in Bhutan there is no Tibetan grammars and much

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.160
 philosophies. And if we do a dharma or more dharma in this

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 life, in this life we will be a peace and it is

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.240
 easy to be a happy life. I like a nun life.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.720
 I request to my mum I want to be a nun because of the dharma.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.280
 Buddha dharma is about your own path, your inner self

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.320
 and they're reaching down to the depths of understanding

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.880
 in early life about the world and they've chosen to be students of the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.360
 Buddha dharma, Buddha's teachings, Buddha's doctrines which are so inspiring and so

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:55.520
 to just take it to a new place and make you whole.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.120
 Being a nun I want to help to all the giving beings as well as

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:12.000
 to teach, to teach whatever I know to the other people.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.480
 There are so many great teachers in India, those Buddhist great

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.880
 women teachers, both in Vinaya systems and as well as Mahayana

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:37.520
 and Vajrayana, in particular Vajrayana there are so many women great teachers.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:48.240
 If I can do, I want to become the Ani Kimbo.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.560
 Yeah really excited, I'm very happy we are going to celebrate

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.920
 and the day after tomorrow I think 12th Sunday

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.360
 coming soon so everyone is so much excited and happy and also energetic

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.720
 monks and nuns everyone is really working hard now

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.840
 trying to prepare all these things this is our one of the beautiful nuns here

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.480
 this is another one. I'm going to put all the prayer flags up so it's very festive

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.760
 but also has the emblem of the horse with the energy horse

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.440
 we call raising up the wind horse and it has all the prayers

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.360
 for revitalizing and bringing all the energies together that's not representing

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.880
 all the coloured energies. This is very powerful.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.560
 I like a one nun, her name is Lauren. I like very much because

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.680
 she's very kind-hearted to us. Also she is helping

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.160
 awarding wishes to build a new nunary. They worked all night last night to finish

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.840
 do some of the finishing touches. We've got some palm trees coming this afternoon

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.000
 and we're going to sort of be in the backdrop

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.200
 of all these workers will have completed it so it looks a little more

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.440
 comfortable. Things go, they're on pace, there are no great machinery,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.120
 bricks and everything is done by hand. I think there has been only one machine

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.000
 here and it's a polishing machine otherwise everything has been done by

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.840
 hand. It's just an extraordinary feat to do this. I think the building started a

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.520
 year ago so we could say that it's 95% finished.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.120
 Wow, they're really doing so well. As a group together,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.040
 they're doing so well. This is the symbol of the Buddha teaching.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.640
 The Buddha teaching is called the Dharma Wheel and

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.240
 it symbolizes all the Buddha's teachings like

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:43.040
 the wheel, meditation and achievement. And then two deers symbolize the teaching

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.280
 of the Buddha is non-volence and peace. This teaching is equal for all the

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.760
 living beings to bring them peace and happiness.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.160
 They're equal, there's no difference between any living beings. We all have the

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.840
 same Buddha nature and we all like the peace and harmony

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.240
 and non-volence. So therefore even the deers and animals also

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.320
 come to listen to such a peaceful teaching and so that's

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.480
 what they symbolize. But they're using that reference books on how to bend

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.400
 and but they're doing really well.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.240
 And we like to be really completed as much as we can before the 12th November

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.920
 so it looks more clean and beautiful so that we can really

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.120
 feel happy and joy and dedicate the merit.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.240
 For the world peace, for all the individualists, to everyone for the

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.800
 good cause.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:44.320
 Tomorrow is then really full day with the spiritual

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.000
 Dharma activities and we're really also going to dedicate

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 these merits for all the living beings, to all the supporting donors and then we

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.040
 wish really to everyone those who are here and those who are

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.520
 gone from our side and every best and every good things

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.680
 happened and then reaching enlightenment in the Buddhahood.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.680
 That's what really we are praying and we are hoping and that's what we're trying

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.720
 to symbolize by every hour event and activities.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.080
 Today we're celebrating

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.960
 the opening of the first nunnery in Sarnath since the time of all Buddha.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.560
 There is no accounts of any nunneries at all.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.040
 We're talking about 2015, 50 years ago.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.240
 Look at this Buddha. Buddha is very arrived here.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:32.240
 [Music]

00:11:52.320 --> 00:12:02.240
 [Music]

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:32.240
 [Music]

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:45.840
 Good morning and welcome everyone. This is one of the very

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.640
 glorious and beautiful day of the Buddhist history. Certainly is for us one

 of the great moment in our life and do meditation practice, do

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.480
 meditation activities. If you do that you will get equal

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.760
 benefit as Buddha himself, living benefit. Because of those all reasons

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.280
 many great devotees of the old from the high

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.120
 to the beginning practitioners visited those holy supporters

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.000
 and many of those praises and remembered and meditated and practiced

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.120
 and bring more love and kindness and compare thought

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.120

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.480
 in the right way.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.480
 As the Buddha gave the first teaching

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.560
 first teaching here and that teaching spread throughout the world

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.000
 and throughout the generations and hopefully

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.600
 as we start this this small nunaries continue to spread

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.800
 the value and call it and teaching in the messages

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.320
 of the Buddha by the God's great Pema Master's

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.240
 continually and throughout the world and throughout the generations.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.760
 So that is really our wish and pray and as we said too

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.920
 first time in Buddhagi the first teaching only five human students

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.000
 only five and we have eight nuns now it couldn't exist

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.960
 and maybe more is coming so so hopefully it will really continue

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.680
 igniting like grass fire and then big continue running as a Mississippi River

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.000
 or River Ganges ongoing unseasoning spreading

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.600
 the really message of the teaching of the Buddha.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.880
 Well everybody's so happy and they're inspired now

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.120
 that some new nuns are coming or the family is growing

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.240
 and they have a great future here at Orgensheim.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.200
 You're trickling, are you trickery?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.560
 Thank you everyone for everybody's help it's just been beautiful.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:26.160
