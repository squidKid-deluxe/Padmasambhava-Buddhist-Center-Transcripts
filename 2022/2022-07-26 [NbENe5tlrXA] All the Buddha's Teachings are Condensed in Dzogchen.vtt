00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
 Tuktu practice combined is known as, commonly known as zopa, chen, zopa chen. It is beautiful,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.520
 all in its ignition, great perfection, all great completion. Maybe I told the picture.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.280
 I mean, it's good to translate the perfection, it is perfect, but also it can be good to translate

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.400
 great completions. What is that? When we practice a tuktu and a toga practice or tuktu, when we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.070
 practice or even a tuktu practices, really it completed all the meritorious, meritorious activities

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.320
.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.920
 What are those meritorious activities? Accumulation meritorious, worship meritorious,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.200
 are completed in Dzogchen. Therefore it's called complete, it's great. It's not just missing some

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.520
 part. It's total practices, when you practice. And when you practice of the Dzogchen or tuktu

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.760
 practice, it also completed all the chamad meditations. It completed all the vipachana meditations.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.800
 It completed all the vigilizations. And the complete characteristics of practices,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 really it captures everything. And it captures, for example, six parama practices and four bodhic

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.960
itta

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.080
 practices. I mean, it is complete, the total complete. And that means also it complete the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.260
 teachings. Partly Bodhayana teachings, Bodhisattva teachings, Karyatenda Bodhayana teachings, Mahay

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.640
oga,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 Anayoga teachings completed. Really it's complete. It's essence. And what is the teaching? When the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 ocean is the gathering places, all the waters, the flows. Same way Dzogchen is all the teachings

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.960
 are condensed in Dzogchen. It's not really missing anything. For therefore it is Dzogchen.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.160
 It's Dzogchen or great completion, great perfection.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.360
 That is, that
