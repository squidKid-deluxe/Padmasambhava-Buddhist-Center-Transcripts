NOTE     "synopsis": "On January 1, 2014 in New York City during the 27th year of the PBC New Year's Retreat, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche led the Vajrasattva Fire Puja practice to pacify all difficulties and negativities, and bring about positive, auspicious conditions for all beings. In this video, Khenpo Rinpoche dissolves the mandala of Vajrasattva before making additional offerings to the mandala while reciting offering mantras with the gathered sangha. Afterwards, the sangha begins the Riwo Sang Chod Mountain of Burnt Offerings practice revealed by the great terton Lhatsun Namkha Jigme.",

 All the fire did it, the fire took to their own,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.040
 to conceal and all, and everything was decided.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.760

 That was the prayer we needed after.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.040
 One body kind of prayer, and the department.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.320
 But we remain ourselves as when they suffer,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.000
