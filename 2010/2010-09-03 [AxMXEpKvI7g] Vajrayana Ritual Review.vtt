00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540
 "And again, truly, I believe this means one of the very beautiful moments all of us through it

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.040
 after having set the heavy, kind of like, years of the summers, in a whole being quite wonderful,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.830
 by the blessings of the lineage masters, and masters. I really want to thank you for the support of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.600
 the Sahaja members, love and kindness and devotion to the teacher, to the lineage, to the teaching.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.480
 And it's been one of the wonderful sessions and wonderful times. I'm so grateful and so thankful to

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.840
 all of you.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.890
 And again, this time we focus on the Shedra practices, or Shedra, but this time we started more

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:58.240
 like a ritual aspect of the Shedra, so that we can practice and use, apply that in basic things.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.300
 Of course, there are a lot of things in the ritual. Ritual is one of the very profound and very

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 dreamy.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.180
 And as long as it's also for the vast complexities and the details, very much, because it is a

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.720
 lineage teaching.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 Lineage teaching is not just "make up" as its homineness and kind of added these mini-constructions

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.800
 as it suits with their own homineness.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:34.070
 But lineage starts with wisdom and compassion, from the Buddha samadabhadra, or the Vaidyadara, or

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.080
 the Buddha Shaptamuni, to the Gurbel Mahasambha.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.890
 And then it is higher, a little bit added as modified, really according to the time and the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.560
 situation and the certain stresses.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:02:01.690
 But basically, the center column, the plaits, the energy and the blessings, all maintained, intact

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.280
 and maintained, and intact, intact, since this teaching started from the Buddha,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.880
 to the Gurbel Mahasambha, all the way. And that's why lineage is very important.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.320
 We are connecting to the ongoing and uninterrupted lineage of the wisdom and compassion.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.390
 Compassion, we are really connecting to that. It's not just bits of the conception added with the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.280
 different these and that things.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.960
 Things and we are connecting and then kind of making up things as go and falling apart.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:45.240
 It is long lasting, deep, tall, standing, family and continuation, teaching and lineage that we are

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.160
 connecting.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.240
 And that is what lineage is, and that is what ritual ceremonies, ceremonies and ritual is.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.480
 And that's why we have the opportunity to go deeper and acknowledge that and restructure our

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.280
 knowledge and understanding of these teachings.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.980
 And as the great master Gurbel Mahasambha said, in that four connections, or as I translated, four

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.000
 connections, all four relationships.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.720
 And the Tantra is connected to the sadness. So Tantra is connected.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.570
 What Tantra must be, essence meaning, reverb, or essence meaning of the Tantra, reverb by the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.280
 sadness.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.720
 So therefore sadness is very important.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.600
 According to Sadhana, again speaking about Sadhana, and the way he talks about very quiet practices

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.140
, practice Sadhana, I think we're quite detailed and thorough, nice one, that which is dravdha and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.080
 almanate.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 It is, in a way, represented more about Sadhana.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.880
 That means the meaning and practice, philosophy, and how to, what are those.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.120
 I mean, he really went quite detailed, his story, everything.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.040
 That is Sadhana that you are learning, learning, and that is ready to practice.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.390
 And once you learn the Sadhana, or went the Sadhana, as Gurbel Mahasambha said, then Sadhana must

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.120
 be connected with the ritual, ritual.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.440
 And that is, that this time we went, let alone, about ritual, ritual things.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.240
 Even though with the Sadhana, we went there, it, of course, all connected, is not something that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.000
 independently, singularly, isolated object.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.360
 All is connected, that's what it means, the four connections of our relationships.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.280
 So Sadhana is connected with the rituals.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.520
 When we speak about the rituals, there is many aspects, as he said.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.440
 Ritual is very vast in the deep, and then it is big.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.520
 But what we discussed? We discussed about the medallas, how to set up them.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.280
 Not just to set up the medallas, but how to function them, activate that medala.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.720
 That's what we discussed.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.040
 Otherwise, also in the dravdha, the almanate also mentioned about the medallas too.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.880
 True, but we went, very bit about how to set up that, how to carry, activate that.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.240
 That's what we discussed about the medallas.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.080
 Then, once we set up the medallas, then what is?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.320
 Then this is, second is for, then follow the Sadhana's.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.640
 Sadhana, then when the Sadhana comes, suggests that we do the offerings.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.240
 So this time, we discuss a little bit of offering, but this time more about the related offering,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
 is the medallas, that we discussed, that more about the medallas.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.600
 Again, we activated our medallas and negations, all medallas.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.800
 We discussed about medallas and gestures, just that whole aspect we discussed.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.200
 Custard and as well as mother in sadhana, that's what we need to know.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.800
 Then when it comes to the Sadhana, what is it?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.920
 Sadhana, the next stage is then the Dhanana Chakra Fist in the Sadhana.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.160
 And that again, which is not just discussed, but we also try to kind of activate that,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:54.160
 and perform that, carrying that duty, that responsibilities, and not just the idea,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:02.800
 not just theoretically, but we follow the lineage, they call it the lineage way, to do that.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.200
 Dhanana Chakra Fist.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.200
 Then along with that whole offering, all that, what is in the Sadhana teachings,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 is that the Dhanana, Dhanas. So we discussed about the Dhanana.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.480
 We discussed about the Dhanana and the meaning of the Dhanana,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.200
 but not just only do we discuss the Dhanana and the meaning, but we learn, again, how to act with,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:38.000
 how to perform the Dhanana, not just theoretically, or just the idea, or just the knowledge,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.560
 where we actually act on the bone. So we, we learn bone with it.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:55.280
 So this means, we act on the ritual, and we act on the leg, such as Mudras and the Dhanana Chakra,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:05.200
 and as well as bones. So that means, we are drool, yogini, and yoginis of the drools of the

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.160
 ceremony,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:14.320
 in the full functioning status, not just only on the book, not just only on the knowledge,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:22.400
 as knowledge, but really we apply that, and that's what we try to do, and that's what we learn.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.110
 And that we are followed with this, again, as Murpema Sama said, the ritual is connected with the

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.040
 lineage.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:38.160
 We went according to lineage and struggles, that's what I learned from the great Masters.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:45.760
 Masters, since I was young, young, I had the great opportunity, or I'm the one of also,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.840
 the pissed persons, that I had so many great beings that had opportunity,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.640
 sustained close by them, with them, day and night in one way. When I reflected back those times,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:07.120
 I'm one of the really beautiful and very lucky persons. True, I believe, and I was, I am.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:16.960
 And I, what I learned, according to my capabilities, through the examples then,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:24.080
 and through the looking then, and through just watching me with them, as what I learned,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:32.320
 and then, as what I learned with my, also with your effort, from them, specifically,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.840
 and struggling, that's what I learned. And I put all that together, in my best capabilities,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.080
 and shared with you all, or offered you all, that's what, so in the lineage speaking there.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:55.200
 Actually, in the teaching always, as you read, read in the teachings, always so important in the

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.560
 teachings, it's important to find the qualified teachers. First, the most important is to find

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.880
 the qualified teachers. But second, in the teachings, once you find the qualified teacher,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.640
 it's so important to be expert, to contact with that qualified teacher. That means to keep up the

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.280
 relationship, something that is so important. So the second is important, is to keep the

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.240
 relationship,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.880
 or to contact, be expert, to be, communicate, in contact, that's what in the teaching always says.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:37.760
 Once you have the expert in that, then in the teaching said, you should be expert to learn

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.000
 of the way the masters, the qualified masters, perform, say, it's not maybe verbally talking

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.520
 all the time, in reading all the time in the books, but be with them in what you learned.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:59.840
 In that contrast, I had those old great opportunities, and I learned what I know,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:08.720
 know, and now what I need is I need more practice. To apply that, we all need that. But that's what

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.520
 according to this lineage, that's what went with this lineage, and then as Murugamma Sama said,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:25.040
 in that portal, and then the bit instructions. Lineage is connected with the bit instructions

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.680
 of the teaching, and I had that opportunity too, too, and that's what I presented to you,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:39.280
 or I offer you. I met according my cover bullet, according our time frames, time of the situation,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.720
 time for a little bit, and I did that. So in that contrast, I had again, I and we all had one of

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:46.880
 the

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:55.360
 great opportunities. Be together, learn that bit, and do all those things, not just only as

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.080
 knowledge

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:03.280
 and just in the book, but we acted on that, on that, and that's how we should maintain and keep

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:11.840
 our lineage teachings, and it is integrity, quality, authenticity, and beauty, and love,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.960
 with the love and the joy and the devotion in ourselves. So that's what we did this time.
