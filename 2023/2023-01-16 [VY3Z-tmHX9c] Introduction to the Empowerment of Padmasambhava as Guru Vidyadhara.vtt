Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 This empowerment, and before I give the empowerment, is part of the lineage, or part of the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 ceremony, that gives some introductions, even though you already might know that, but I am going to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.000
 give you the introduction.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.310
 Now, we are ready, again, to visit the involvement, as always, to re-spend and re-activate our

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 motivations. Because we have motivations, there are so many different motivations, but some of the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.330
 motivations that line up according to the teachings, according to the practices, that is what we

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.000
 have to activate.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.300
 In this case, of the millions of the motivations, or the consumption of food, we bring up something

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.930
 that is important and beneficial to ourselves, and it will bring the power of our practice in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.000
 meditation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 So therefore, motivation is so important, and which is, again, any of you already heard so many

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.000
 times, and I say it mostly every day, so every time I'm talking to you every day.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 So, you know already, I'm going to repeat that again, and obviously you're not bored with that.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 But he's talking again there, again there. So, that is joy and appreciation, and it's good, good

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.000
 stuff, really good.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.290
 We have joy and appreciation, I think our life is a little more meaningful, more rich, more rich

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 there.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.070
 And then, together with that, we devote each other. That is so, again, important, is the foundation

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.000
, central column of our practice in meditation,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 of the generally the Buddha teaching, I think a little bit Mahayana and the Vedayana teaching.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.230
 So, thank you. Today I'm going to receive empowerment, in order to benefit all living beings, I'd

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.000
 like to get enlightenment within this lifetime.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 Part of the skillful means of the Vedayana teaching, I'd like to act like my enlightenment within

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.000
 this lifetime, and I'd like, through that, I'm going to benefit for every living being.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And really, when the intention is told, even in short time, it is a dharma, it is a practice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Actually, it is some tremendous hidden power from our roots of the potentials.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 We bring up that, which is really wonderful.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.280
 And then, together with this involvement, is the Vedayana teaching, and the skillful means of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 teaching that the Buddha taught.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.340
 The Vedic teacher, Buddha, taught. So, again, seeing everything as a vedalas, vedala of the virupa-

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.000
masambha.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 The whole universe and everything as a vedala of the virupa-masambha, all included our forms,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.770
 and all sources at times are the speaking vedala of the virupa-masambha and all the mind, our mind,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.000
 everyone's mind, and the space it is.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Vedala of the virupa-masambha's wisdom, that is absolutely virupa-masambha is our innate nature,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 your innate nature.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.020
 We are expanding. We are letting that radiary, you call it, to every, every direction, subject and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.000
 object.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Those are known as the activated motivations.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 With that motivation, and then we now go to the introduction of these teachings.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.280
 This teaching, again, is taught by the gracious, kind, compassion, skillful means teacher, the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.000
 Buddha Shatyamuni,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.450
 who came two thousand, about six hundred years ago, or some chronologist, even before, more than

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.000
 that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.410
 But what you are the standard kind of time, everyone says is about two thousand, six hundred years

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.000
 ago.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.200
 This gracious teacher, Buddha, gave from age thirty-five, under age eighty-one, the variety of

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.000
 teachings,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 that well, everyone has opportunity to discover their innate nature.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Buddha's teaching is not teaching, that's something that you have to go somewhere, to be something,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 different beings.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Buddha's teaching is to bring our innate nature, to discover our own nature.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.260
 Buddha's nature is open, says, "Nature is right in our heart center, right with our mind, to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.000
 discover that nature."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.280
 And Buddha gave variety of teachings, according to readiness, capabilities of the individuals, he

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.000
 gave the teachings.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So, all teachings are known as the nayana teachings, different levels of teachings.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 These levels are not just designed level, but it is when you are advancing, then you are reaching,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 you discover another dimension of the quality of the richness of our nature.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.790
 When you are more advanced, you discover more and more, and Buddha is kind of matching up, catching

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.000
 up with our levels,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.670
 and our duties, and our capabilities, and there is a teaching to articulate that to the correct

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.000
 path,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 so that we are not just fell down on ditch, ditch or the ditch holes, really to bring up that.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And all is the same goal, to removing our obscurations, negative emotions, bring more joy,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 evocation, love and compassion, and openness, calmness, peacefulness.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Then, see, really, what we are talking three mandalas, when you really got good relaxation,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.290
 it is not just the talking and the conceptual level, but you really see everything as three mandala

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.000
 states.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Whether poem, whether song, or whether mind, or mandala of the poem,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 poem mandala, Buddha mandala, and the song of the speech mandalas, and what is the mind mandala,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 that really says that.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 So then, that is what the Buddha gives a lot of teaching.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And then, Parego, the very inner teaching, is known as the skillful means of teaching.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.240
 Generally, the Buddha's teaching is, teaching is based on the compassion and wisdom combined

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.000
 together.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 But the very inner teaching has more skillful means of teaching.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.270
 Teaching, so that skillful means what? It is easy and quick to reach enlightenment or to discover

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.000
 our inner nature,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 to discover our own true beings, or enlightenment, called beings,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 the wakefulness of the quality of the enlightenment that really works instantly.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 So all teaching is designed with that.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And the very inner is so, the quality of teaching is so powerful.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Powerful. If you have the courage and commitment and confidence and joyful effort to the virtues,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 if you have that, we can reach enlightenment.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Really, within this life, even if we didn't get enlightenment, we wouldn't make the difference,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 truly the difference.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 That is really true. Even if we practice meditation, for example, for one hour,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 for quite a bit good with devotion and joy and everything, concentrated,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.400
 after one hour, we see some kind of like, let it sizzle and something a little bit slightly

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.000
 different.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Really, we see. Then again, of course, just with our midst of the duality and emotion,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 happy, dependent, you kind of dreamt up. Again, call it up. Call it up.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 But that is, we have to do on and on practice.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Therefore, also here is commonly saying, the practice makes perfect.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Practice makes the brains to be perfect, gradually, slowly.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 But our nature is pure. Our nature is beautiful.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Our nature is enlightened according to the teaching.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 So really, with a brain, getting closer and closer,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 just call it full bloom of the reality of the true nature of the enlightenment as it is,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 as the really many practitioners and witnesses.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 So among that, today, there are so many skill means of teaching in the medallana.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 But among that, today is empowerment.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Empowerment is one of the very powerful skill means of teaching.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.670
 Again, I talk this little bit with this song, very little bit, very introduction of the empowerment

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.000
.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 But also, first, I talk a little bit about the verphema sambhav.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Today, you'll see with the empowerment of verphema sambhav.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And then again, who taught these teachings?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Already said and already know that a little bit.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 But Buddha taught these teachings.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Right, the teacher, Buddha taught many different levels of teaching.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Particularly, this very inner teaching, what we do for the following is the inner tandoor teaching.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Inner tandoor has three tantras, Mahayoga Tantra, Anu-Yoga Tantra, Ati-Yoga Tantra.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And this teaching, today what we are going to offer in empowerment,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 is the combination of the three tantras.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Three inner tantra, Mahayoga, Anu-Yoga, and Ati-Yoga teachings.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 All that combined, targeted, and then as practices.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So that is really what it is.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And then, this teaching is, of course, continued in India.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And then it ended in many different countries.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And then it came to Tibet at centuries.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 By the great master of verphema sambhav.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And then, great master of chandala chadha.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 By the invitation or the courage and the commitment of the characters of Devti.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 He invited those great masters.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Three of them come together and astounded, to be the Buddhism.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Like what we call the mini-Buddhism is poor body of the Buddhism.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 From the foundation schools of the Buddhism teaching,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 such as Theravada or the Sarvat schools, all the way to the Ati-Yoga.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 The whole body of the Buddhism really came to Tibet.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And not just came the literature aspect, but the realization also came.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Because they practiced, they made it, actually the realization.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Not just that intellectual level.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 As a stimulation for the brain. It's not just that.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Really, they practiced and meditated.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 And they become a teaching themselves.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And those are then known as the 25 disciples from the European sambhav

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 and the great master of ajali chandala chadha and so forth.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 From that starting point.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 And all those great masters of all the schools of the way of Buddhism

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 maintained this great teaching.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Teaching with starting, contemplating, and practicing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Covered with humble symbol, drawn to the earth,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 and discovered in the light from the heart,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 and shining that to the other way.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Really, always guided that.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 That is what really the teaching is.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So came to Tibet.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And particularly this involvement, in which it came,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 by this lineage, such a high light by the great master,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Guru Bhema Sambhavas.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 He gave first time to nine students in the cave of the Samyam monastery,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 on the mountain of the Samyam monastery.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 So Samyam chief of cave.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Guru Bhema Sambhavas did not give this teaching in the palace,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 not in the public places.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 He gave in the hermitage, cave, nine students.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Those first nine students who received the teaching,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 they're named as heart, nine heart students.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 That included Kritosundehe himself.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 That received.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 So that's how the empowerment is continued.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And then this is continued.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Then, these teachings are, according in my school,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 that teaching is continued, carried by two lineage.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Two major lineage.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Those are known as kama and dharma.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Whenever you know kama.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Kama is an oral transmission lineage

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 that started from the Buddha and the Guru Bhema Sambhavas,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 or particularly those great masters.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 And then in the Tibetan, all the masters continued

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 as oral transmission and instruction,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 and with instruction that continued carried,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 and that's called kama.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 In the Tibetan world, kama, oral, that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And dharma means hidden and rediscovered lineage.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Hidden by who?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Majority of the hermitages are hidden by,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 by the Guru Bhema Sambhavas,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 toghed with the great wisdom raqini,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 female enlightened beings,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 known as Yishinsoja.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 They've all hidden so many teachings,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 so many treasures.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 I mean, treasures such as ritual objects,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 such as these bells and the dorjis, dhammarus,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 parts of the belongings of the Guru Bhema Sambhavas himself,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yishinsoja, kintasong deity,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 or even the Buddhas and the great masters from India,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 those parts of the belonging, they had that,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 and hidden that for the thinking of the future generations,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 along with the teachings itself.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So many teachings.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Those all modern teachings are related with the inner centers.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Mahayoga Tantra, Anupayoga Tantra,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 and Adiyoga Tantra, discovered continually.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And one after another great designated master,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 the revealers, came,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 came from around eleven centuries until now.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So many great masters, really came, authentic masters, came.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Those are known as the thetongs, many of you know, discovered.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 One after another, those great teachings,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 those ritual objects, those great traits,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 as object of venerations.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Those, they take that, that much.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Ah, oh, mainly is it, can't really,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 hidden those teachings represented,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 particularly Buddhas or the enlightenment.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Poem, enlightenment, the speech, enlightenment minds.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Poem represented such as the statues,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 various dharas.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 So, for the statue, so many.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Those mainly represented as,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 what's the body of the Buddhas, object of venerations.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Those are the personal belongings of Gurupan Masambhav,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 all other great masters, all other different dakini rams,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 all the slushy rams, all those slushy sacred objects,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 and they hidden that.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And the speaker represented of all the Buddhas hidden,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 One after another, those are all.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 All is connected to the three, mostly three, and others.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Mahayoga, Anoyoga, Adiyogi.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 And those are also more emphasized,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 skillful means aspect of teaching.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Muslim means aspect of teaching.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Union of the skillful means the Muslim aspect of teaching.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 It's really variety of teachings in it,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 discovered one after another, those teachings.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And that is continually carried out now, that lineage.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And particularly today,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 why I'm offering you the involvement,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 whenever you all know, Guru Vida Dara.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 This Guru Vida Dara is a Themmah teaching

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 of the great Thetung Thaksamunga,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 who came around 17th century, or around that time.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 17th or 18th century, around that time he came.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 He was the emanation of the Nooki Sanghi Ishi.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And Nooki Sanghi Ishi is headed back to the 8th century,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 one of the half-disciple of the work of Mahasamma.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Parigola Nooki Sanghi Ishi was the Yogi,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 or the Maha Siddha of the Mejushiri and the Yama Thaksa.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 They were very famous.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So he was so famous.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 He was a nappa, lived practicing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Very highly achieved in life, the Yogi beings and scholars.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 He was a disciple of Guru Khenmasambhava

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and Maha Siddha Shanda Rakhtab, as well as others.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 And he practiced.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Nooki Sanghi Ishi become also one of the principal lineage holder

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 of the Nookman Kamas.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Always the Nookama said that how the Nookama continued.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 For the course of the course came from the great masters

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 such as Gurbia Mahasambhava

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 and Master Shanda Rakhtab and Bhagavan Mataji.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 But then who hold those teachings?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 For his teachings, sorry, there was something here.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 That would be a part of it.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And what was his name?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 So most of these famous masters known as Yang Jana Kumar, very famous.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Yang Jana Kumar, when he showed the realization of this,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 had contrast in it, made history.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Those great masters had contrast in front of Gurbia Mahasambhava,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Ajayi Shanda Rakhtab and Bhagavan Mataji.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 So they showed what the achievement, the science.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 And Jana Kumar put the finger or the dagger on the rock

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 and immediately spring water came, only the water came.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So that was his power.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Power in the teaching always said Jana Kumar discovered the nectar

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 from the rocky mountains, discovered that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 So that is Jana Kumar.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 He was also one of the heart, nine hearts like students

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 and particularly he is really known as the actualized,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 the quality of the enlightenment.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 All the quality of enlightenment, such as Vaidya Hirugo or Yanda Hirugo's teachings.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 He is the master of the Yanda Hirugo among the head Hirugo's, head Hirugo's, among the head Hirugo

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.000
's.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And then that teaching, the river of that teaching came to the Kama teaching

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 then transferred to the Nubji Sanyishi.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 So Nubji Sanyishi become the second Kama lineage

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 or the entire teaching of the Kama lineage order.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Along with it he was, Nubji Sanyishi was the partner of the Anu-Yoga teachings, Nubji Sanyishi.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Nubji Sanyishi bordered really according to the teaching,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 he stored, then born this Anu-Yoga teaching to Tibet.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 He went and traveled to all over India and many other part of the country,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 neighboring country and received Anu-Yoga teaching and brought back to Tibet.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So he was the partner of the Anu-Yoga teachings.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 So Nubji Sanyishi, also when they had contest of that,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 contest of their realization to show sign externally what he did.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 He threw this quote, he put the wooden dagger, dagger on solid rocks.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Rocks, that is already known that he put there.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So that's the word sign.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 And Nubji Sanyishi emanated so many great masters of scholars,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 masters who uphold Buddha teaching by meditating and practicing

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 and through literature teaching, so many great scholars emanated

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 as well as many thetums.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 So among that, one of the great emanation of thetum was Thasun Numba.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 So Thasun Numba is a renowned emanation of the Nubji Sanyishi.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And this teaching is very rooted in where I was born,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 in eastern Tibet known as Dokho regions.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 There is a monastery, also known as the Gucci monastery,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 who practiced this Thasun Numba lineage teachings,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 practiced one of the relief principles, or kind of center,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 lineage holders of this Thasun Numba teachings.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 And when I was young, I also received, kind of naturally,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 I was connected to that teaching because the parents,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 parents said, like, their kindness,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 and then I had the opportunity to receive so many Thasun Numba teachings.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 When I was young, young at that time,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 also there is a well-known lineage holder of this Thasun Numba lineage

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 known as Lama Nima, or Khada Lama Nima.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 So from him, I received entire Thasun Numba teachings,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 transmission, involvement, and transmission,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 along with the Kati body chairman.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 And then, after that, also I received this teaching

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 of the Thasun Numba teachings,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 about this involvement many times from the Kati body chairman.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And then also in 1882, I think, I believe.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 No, not '82, '84.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 '84, and Thasun Numba, all the Thasun Numba,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 the Kati body chairman had a big effort

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 of trying to gather all the Thasun Numba,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 teaching that Thasun Numba what we can find.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And he probably had about 11 of them, all of them.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Nine of them ever connected to that.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 And that was not just only Thasun Numba teachings.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Thasun Numba was more than that teaching,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 but he was able to connect with that teaching.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 And then, so at that time,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 we had a whole copy of that in New York City,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 where his own Dunyur Muja Center,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Yixin Yempo, where we stayed and served

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 as a resident teacher, there for quite a few years,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 or many years each other, stayed there.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 At that time, Kati body chairman

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 brought all the texts to his own Dunyur Muja,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 asked to give the empowerment of the text empowerment,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 all the empowerment of book empowerment, text empowerment.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 That is very popular in the community,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 because since his own Dunyur Muja

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 is the region of the Merpe and Masambhava,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 and therefore, he also hold the Thasun Numba lineage to him.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 So therefore, Kati body chairman

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 asked him, "Please give us empowerment,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 this text empowerment."

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Of course, he can give all, everything,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 it takes a long time.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 And his own Dunyur Muja was very,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 very kind of excitedly accepted.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 "Yes, I will do."

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Really, he said that.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 And then, we both stayed in front of that text,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 and then we received that.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Also, blessings from his own Dunyur Muja.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 So this is all what...

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 What is the history of the lineage?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 So I also practice these teachings.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 So that's really, in that way,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 I'm offering you the empowerment.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Now, I talk really about the empowerment.
