00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.180
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Good to see you. Yay. Once again, we did it. We made it. We're

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.480
 still breathing. We still have an opportunity to have Dharma awaken in our hearts and that

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 kind of sparkle alive in our minds. So here we are again, really. It's a truly precious

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.200
 time to have this opportunity and to actually seize it, this Dharma. So what we do, as we

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.680
 always do, is awaken our own sizzling Buddha nature in these three ways. The first is generating

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.120
 this mind of joy and gratitude. We really brighten our awareness. So this is called

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.640
 renunciation. We soften our hearts. We become gentle and receptive to being natural to the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.540
 nature, to the Dharma. And so this is renunciation or joy and appreciation. So really turn that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.920
 on. There's so many reasons we have to be really appreciative and very thankful for this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.960
 opportunity

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.840
 right now. We have so much going for us. So then really connect to that. You could simply

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.260
 call that gratitude. So really try to turn on that gratitude. And then secondly, always

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.680
 this bodhicitta, which is just the heart essence of everything the Buddha taught, bodhicitta,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 the heart mind of enlightenment. So we try to really reaffirm that view and the commitment

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.120
 that why are we here kind of thinking of the Dharma, reflecting on the Dharma, practicing

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.440
 the Dharma with this Dhujum Teresarnandra sadhana. It's really genuinely so that I can

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.400
 become enlightened, free of every single way that I kind of just create this whole problem

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.440
 for myself and get in all these cycles of suffering. So I will be free of all that.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.240
 And why? To help every single being awaken their own true nature and also be free and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.760
 enlightened. Like that's the motivation we're trying to arouse is bodhicitta. It's the deepest,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.880
 most profound motivation possible. And all of all the universes is bodhicitta that every

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.320
 single being is free from suffering and the causes of suffering. And in order for that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.480
 to happen, I take the responsibility of having to wake up myself so that I can actually help

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.000
 beings do that, become a support for beings to just be themselves, have their own Buddha

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.980
 nature fully awaken. This is so kind of unspeakably important. And then thirdly, this pure

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.560
 perception,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.100
 this is Dhujum Teresarnandras of Asriyana practice. This is Tibetan Buddhist practice.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.120
 So we're kind of at least for this time, we're like kind of turning on this pure view, we're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.400
 kind of more generally called devotion, kind of really trying to see this sacredness of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.360
 our experience right now. The sacredness of the things that we see, the kind of sacredness

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.520
 of any kind of things we hear, the sacredness of any movements of mind, this form, sound,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.560
 space, we're trying to really connect to that. First, we connect to our Buddha nature. And

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.600
 from there, then everything we see here in the movement of mind is seen as a natural

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.040
 expression of the Buddha nature, enlightened energy or enlightened display. So in this

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.000
 kind of more general sense of pure perception, talking about it very generally. So then we

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.520
 kind of awaken these three aspects of our own natural, this natural capacity of our

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.120
 heart and our mind, gratitude, joy and appreciation. And then bodhicitta, the awakened heart mind

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.760
 of enlightenment. And then pure perception, seeing everything is innately perfectly good

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 already. Let me do that now.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:05:00.280
 So the topic for this kind of brief time of reflection today, I think in general is just

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:10.500
 about settling down. Kind of the official kind of more topic title is slow and steady by

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.320
 leaps and bounds, slow and steady by leaps and bounds, slow and steady. I thought really

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.600
 just to kind of like take a pause in a way just to settle and really reflect and kind

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 of really connect to what we already have going for us, specifically as students, as

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.400
 like practitioners of Buddha Dharma, following in the footsteps of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.640
 Guru Padmasambhava and these lineage masters. Just to really kind of pause with that, like

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:51.720
 deep wealth of practices and teachings we've received. And even if we're really new to

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.600
 the Dharma, it's like a single line of Dharma by the Buddha or Guru Rinpoche. It goes all

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.500
 the way to enlightenment. It's a complete, it's like an inexhaustible treasure trove,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.760
 even a single line of Dharma. So we have this richness. We already enjoy it. And some of

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.920
 us have been doing this for years. And then years and years build up and the hair gets

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.800
 grayer and the hearing gets less and everything keeps changing around and the bodies get kind

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:35.860
 of weaker, friends start going, family members start going, leaving our sight. So I thought

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:45.320
 this is kind of a moment to just pause a little bit and like settle down. It's slow and steady.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.000
 I mean, so much of our time now is kind of this cultural kind of flow that we, so many

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:03.480
 of us seem to be in, is always moving. Go, go, go, go, go. There's so many new things,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.760
 so much and so much to know. So many new ways we have to show up. And Dharma too, there's

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.600
 so much Dharma out there on the internet and around in the world. There's so much Dharma

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:28.720
 is a really extraordinary, it's a very rare time to have the Dharma be so accessible.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.440
 But we can get in this habit, which is just being a sentient being. It's a sentient habit,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:41.880
 roa, we wonder, leapfrog, one teaching, next teaching, next teaching, next teaching, one

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.520
 practice. Oh, we'd be with the practice for a little bit. And then we get bored with it

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.120
 and probably not that long. Then we try to get another practice where with one teacher,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.340
 all these teachers, all these zap me, so powerful, so amazing, you know, and then it kind of wears

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:07.580
 off a little bit because we can't always get zapped. It's really hard to be that fresh.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.160
 It's like traveling to a new country. Of course, we go to a new country, go to a new place,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.560
 new currency, new food, new people, new language, and it's foreign. We don't know it, so we

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.520
 have to be fresh because it's unknown. But we can't just travel to a new place all the

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:30.480
 time. This becomes really dislocated, really exhausting, really confusing, really just

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:38.660
 tiring. And it also makes our minds very superficial. Something really obvious has to slam us over

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:47.320
 the head as being new. Whoa, this is so unusual, you know. And so much of the subtlety of reality

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.360
 of the Dharma, of ourselves, of our intelligence, of our heart, of our quality of love, we just

00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:03.920
 overlook it. Everything has to be so loud, so obvious, so shocking. And this becomes

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.440
 a habit, a habit to just wonder, wonder, wonder, move, move, move, move. And this is just a

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.520
 sentient being habit, this drowa, it's literally the definition of sentient, sentient being.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.640
 Wonder, a wanderer. We just have to settle, at a certain point have to settle, at least

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.340
 try, see what it's like to like put some roots somewhere and just be like, what is this like

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.300
 to just stay put here for a while? Stay put on my cushion or just, I'm going to stay put

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.280
 in a relationship, stay put, just looking at my mind for a while. What's my mind like?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:49.400
 Look genuinely, what's going on with me? Actually look. So Buddhism, we stop, we basically is

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 like in one way practice of non-doing. We just stay put, don't do anything for a while,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:01.440
 see what happens, because everything keeps moving. But if we don't stay put for a while,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.360
 we just going to constantly at the end, it's so sad. In the end, we didn't actually make

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.300
 friends with ourselves. We didn't stop and be like, who am I? What's going on? What is

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:20.040
 my mind like? What is my heart like? What do I really love? What am I scared of? And

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:28.360
 with our relationships, so much of this word that keeps coming to my mind is depth, depth,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:36.920
 the deep, profound, the Dharma is so profound and our nature is so profound. And we just

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:46.440
 need, we need one way in that suits my mind, an avenue in that really makes my mind fresh.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.320
 But the thing is, is that initial impulse or the initial shock or the newness, the freshness

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:57.440
 that was from outside, it was so new. Whoa, I couldn't help but being fresh, it's new.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.360
 But then I have to take that same thing, and I have to approach it freshly. In the end,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.480
 the Dharma becomes about us on me, my mind. Because if I just keep changing things outside,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.920
 rearrange everything, new furniture, new place, new partner, new this, new job, new all this,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.360
 in some degree, we need to change things. That's okay, whatever. But if it becomes a

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.640
 habit, because we're basically just bored. And one way we can look at that differently,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:35.960
 we're just it's too scary to go deep. So be always on the surface, surface, surface, surface.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.920
 Really obvious, really tangible. And say that's a quality of degenerate age, everything has

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.080
 to be so tangible. All the subtleties we get, we don't pay attention to all the subtle layers.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:12:02.520
 The depth is lost. So what's like the most essential teaching in Buddhism? Refuge. Go

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:12.720
 for refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. It's the essence. But then we can think, Oh, I've

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:24.480
 been practicing for 20 years, 30 years, whatever refuge, that's like so beginner, you know.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.320
 And this kind of talk, that kind of that kind of thinking makes these wisdom beings just

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:39.840
 cry. So sad. It's everything, refuge is everything. If we did, if we overlook refuge. It's so sad,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.280
 because I say that for my own self, because it's so easy to overlook, so easy to get in

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:51.480
 the habit of one something big, big, loud, bright, big, some secret thing, you know,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:57.240
 only a few people can go. I'm one of the few people look at me, I'm so special, you know,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.160
 or I've done so many things, I counted so many numbers of the practice and all that.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 It just becomes all about me again. It's the same old thing. Me, me, me, me, me. It's the

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:16.720
 same thing, you know. And it's so sad. So settling. 갑어서 어는 있을 마치, so many times

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.360
 to settle.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.000
 Refuge is essentially about finally settling. We have confidence in a path. What's the

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.800
 primary condition of awakening? Buddha nature. My mind is a hundred percent good. Your mind

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.040
 is a hundred percent perfect, a hundred percent. There's nothing wrong with your mind or your

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:46.200
 heart. It's a hundred percent perfect. But they say, Rinpoche say, it's not enough. We

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:53.120
 need the supportive conditions for that principle cause of our Buddha nature to fully awaken.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:04.600
 And they say the main supportive conditions are Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And there's so

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.840
 many ways to unpack Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, the three jewels, the refuge. And Rinpoche is

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.360
 just illuminating the path of their book on the commentary on the 갑어서 갑어는

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.120
 teaching. Illuminating the path. This goes in through the refuge section, all the sections

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.680
 of the 갑어서 갑어서 갑어는, but their section on refuge is so beautiful. I

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.480
 mean they're so, I like have all these quotes pulled out and all these things can kind of

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:44.280
 repeat, but that's also kind of in one way. It's not really tired. It's more like, it's

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.440
 like kind of scared that the Dharma becomes just another entertainment. Another, need

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:56.240
 another zap, you know. Another teacher has to like twist it and like kind of not, not

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:03.760
 change it, but just like, oh, do all this effort to make us turn on and show up. And

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.600
 I think that's a one way. It's a little scary because then we're starting to, if we, if

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.080
 we're in that experience and we require the teacher to do all the work, they have to make

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:21.480
 us lean in and pay attention. Then the, it's kind of an inverted thing, you know. The Dharma

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.800
 is the valuable thing that we need to actually be really curious about. The Dharma is not

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:34.600
 trying to bend over backwards to make us curious. Like it's our job as practitioners, as students

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:42.320
 to like, like actually kind of open that in ourselves. Otherwise we're just like a little

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.920
 kid all the time, mommy, daddy, to make me, give me the thing, you know. I mean, I don't

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:56.040
 mean to say it sound too harsh, but it's kind of true. Just like, give me, give me, I want

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:05.040
 this now, give me. It's so sad. But this is like such a rare little window. We have this

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.520
 beautiful temple. We have these living teachers. We have this Dharma, this stacks of Dharma

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.240
 books, the internet. You can look up an infinite Dharma on the internet, all these YouTube videos,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:26.600
 all these podcasts. And then what happens? I can't find five minutes in my day to practice.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:36.760
 That's a big problem. So we wonder, wonder, wonder. And then at the end we're like, what

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.480
 did I, it's like sand through the hands. Like what did I do in the end? I'm really tired

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.520
 and there's a lot of complaints about what's wrong with everything in the world. Her and

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.860
 him and this and the place and this and that. And then we're just tired, but we didn't find

00:16:52.860 --> 00:17:00.440
 any time to do what we knew was most important. To awaken my heart, to be kind, to be a loving

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:08.800
 person, to be a genuinely like caring person, a good person. Someone comes to me and they

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.920
 need help. And I like, I'm like right there, like how can I help? What's going on? You

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:24.760
 know, to really be a good person. And at the same time, really light touch. Because there's

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.920
 going to be so much tragedy in life. It's the truth of suffering. It's just endless suffering.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.400
 In my own mind, every moment, suffering, everything we experience suffering, there's always, even

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:45.280
 if it's the best thing, it's only temporarily there. And then it changes and dissolves.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.000
 There's always this heartbreak in that we can't, we can't have it. We can't have even

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.880
 these beautiful things. They just keep changing and leaving. There's always this suffering.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.320
 So we also need to see through this to see our, of course, we're talking about a Buddha

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.200
 nature here, to see our own nature, our own goodness. And part of that is the absolute

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:15.540
 unchanging aspect of our nature, the ultimate refuge, right? Absolute Gurumbhache, but the

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:22.760
 absolute Buddha Dharmasanga, the unchanging quality of our awareness. So this is also

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.880
 talked about as the illusory nature of experience. Then we need to be more and more familiar

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:37.160
 with this. One, we show up with so much care and kindness. Because we're genuinely like

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:47.040
 really connected. We feel a genuine interest, but at the same time, it's just always changing.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.980
 And if we forget the unchanging aspect of awareness, of experience, then we're going

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:59.720
 to constantly just be heartbroken. Life will just rip our heart out again and again and

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.800
 again. If we only see the suffering of conditioned existence, but we don't realize the cessation

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:15.160
 of suffering, or we don't see the absolute nature of the suffering, the emptiness, then

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.640
 this path is going to just be in one way brutal because the Buddha didn't just teach the first

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.640
 noble truth. There's always, he taught the cessation and the path, and we need a path.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.840
 The path is the supportive condition for our own primary principle cause, the Buddha nature

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.960
 to fully awaken. And then the foundational level of Buddha's teaching that goes all the

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:44.760
 way through all the most secret, esoteric, profound, ultimate teachings is refuge. Refuge

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.520
 in Buddha dharmasanga. And illuminating the path, Ramaiches go through it, the outer refuge,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:58.760
 inner refuge, secret refuge, ultimate or most secret refuge. And we've heard this. For many

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.920
 of us, we've heard these teachings so much. The three jewels are the outer refuge. The

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:13.160
 three roots, Guru, Deva, Dakini, are the inner refuge. The secret refuge, saa, long, tigle,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:21.360
 you know? Channels, winds, vital essence. The most secret or ultimate refuge is three kyas,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.160
 dharma kya, sambhoga kya, nirmana kya. The nature of the rigpa is all that. We've heard

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:37.680
 all this, the essence in nature and responsiveness. But is it alive in my mind? Is refuge really

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:44.720
 alive in this moment? Am I going for refuge or do I have to just stand up and do a prostration

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:53.240
 and prove to someone I'm doing refuge? Cause if it's not alive in my mind, then I definitely

00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:00.240
 need to stand up and do a prostration. And I definitely, me personally, need to do so

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:15.360
 many more prostrations. So many. So I don't know. I mean, I have all these notes and books

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:32.680
 and things. And really, I mean, it's kind of just, you know, we're so fortunate. Three

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:40.800
 jewels, three roots, three kyas. We have everything we need. We have everything, everything we

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:52.140
 need. And the clock is ticking. And then it's going to just continue. And we don't know

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:59.120
 what's next after this body stops. I don't know what's next for me, but this is so good

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.800
 for me right now. I have such a good setup to practice dharma. Then I say, what's the

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:13.280
 dharma? Right. We can do some quotes too. It's all good. In this walking in the footsteps

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.480
 of the Buddha by the Kimbal Ramachis, 18, page 18, our own mind is the primary target

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.600
 of dharma practice. Of course, we have to study and understand the teachings, but the

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.760
 point isn't just to be able to recite something. The dharma has to be absorbed into our hearts

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.360
 and minds. Dharma isn't a show or some kind of announcement or proclamation. Of course,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.960
 we may occasionally announce and show the dharma, but the essence of dharma is practice

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.880
 and absorbing the teachings into our hearts and minds. Let your mind become gentler. Let

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.240
 it be more peaceful and more joyful. Let your mind be full of love, kindness, patience and

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.120
 understanding. Don't let your mind be restricted by clinging to ego or negative emotions. Don't

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.700
 let it be carried away by skepticism, doubt, hesitation, intellectual ideas, or traditions.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.980
 This doesn't mean we can't have traditions or these other things, but when we're practicing

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:14.580
 the dharma, let them dissolve. Let them vanish within the space of the Dharma Dattu and bring

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:22.760
 forth the genuine, open, calm state of mind and relax. Just be in that state. Let joy,

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:30.080
 peace and appreciation arise very naturally like rainbow light or like the mist of springtime.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.240
 Keep this view all the time with the joy of sunlight in your heart and mind. That is known

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:42.520
 as practicing the dharma. Really try and focus your mind with mindfulness, joy and alertness,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 always trying to bring forth those qualities as much as you can. And then this is the dharma.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.720
 I mean, this is our mind. This is the nature of our mind and its qualities shine forth

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:03.720
 as love, compassion, wisdom, patience, kindness, forgiveness, energy, enthusiastic energy,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:14.260
 to really serve beings, to serve the teachings. Not to have beings serve me or have the teachings

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:21.360
 serve me, but to really genuinely love, you know, like really deeply love, you know, like

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.600
 deep love, not just surface love, not just conditional love. You give me what I want

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.680
 and then I'll be nice. But deep love that comes from Buddha nature, like it's not love

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:38.200
 because something happened. It's just love because that's the nature. It's just love.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:45.480
 The mind, the heart, it just cares. It just includes. It's naturally compassionate. All

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.640
 these, there's so many teachings, the renunciation. There's so many, there's all these gems of

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.360
 nuggets of teachings, page 30, the same book. Renunciation, which often kind of seems like

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.960
 a bad news. I lose the good things or something. But renunciation here, Rinpoche say, "Renunciation

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:07.400
 is very important because it makes our heart more soft, kind and practical. With a softer

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:13.600
 heart you naturally begin to feel more appreciation and respect. Life isn't only full of hardships,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:23.200
 like running bulls all the time." Renunciation, like all the preciousness of this experience

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.360
 now, of these sense doors working, of this world, of this air, of the Dharma here, of

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:37.120
 my friends and family. And it's all impermanent. And the day, I mean, it's going to go by and

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:43.720
 I'm going to look back and be like, "It went so fast." And then what can I do now? Will

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.480
 cause condition and effect, karma. Be in a state of love and kindness now and it'll lead

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:56.000
 to that state of mind in the future. Avoid negative states that make me more tense, more

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.840
 allergic, like more reactive, more harsh. Just don't do that as much. And why? Because

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:13.200
 that's samsara. That's samsaric mind. It's not connecting to my nature or the nature

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.280
 in others, the goodness nature, the Buddha Dharma, and like the Buddha nature in oneself

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.800
 and others, it's connecting instead to the crusty duality habits. Just these mistaken

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.920
 perceptions, these very limited kind of ways that cause us to feel so unsettled, so irritated,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:42.360
 so restless. Although like prickly aspects of experience, then that's just samsaric mind.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.640
 So instead we're trying to really, before our mind does that, before it gets so kind

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.720
 of severe, but it's soften, like connect to that inner bravery, which is so vast, it's

00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:00.320
 so open. It doesn't have a territory to defend. Everyone is always, everyone's already the

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.320
 best friend. We're not just, we're not saying I want to help this person, not that person.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.240
 We're trying to just really be like a quantumist, even really be in a pervasive unconditioned

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:22.040
 nature. Again, this is ultimate refuge to be in that nature. So kind of, this is just

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:31.940
 like in one way a little bit of rambling about kind of the importance of trying to be settled.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:37.040
 And we have this, this is so rare. I'm in many different circles, right, as a human

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:48.240
 being and we all are. I'm in one, I happen to be in one circle, which is this circle,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:57.080
 the Buddhist one. And I'm in other non-Buddhist circles. You know why? Because there's so

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:05.000
 many sentient beings and they're not all card-carrying Buddhists. They have Buddha nature. I love

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.480
 them. But you know what, so many of the non-Buddhist circles I'm in, they're really looking for

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:24.560
 a path, something that's reliable. And they're really so intelligent and they're really looking,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.200
 they're like hungry for wisdom, right? There's a thing nowadays people call wisdom famine.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:40.840
 And as Buddhists, we don't have that problem. That's not really a challenge for us. Buddha's

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:47.960
 been talking about prajna, a wisdom, for thousands of years. There's millions of Buddhists. There's

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:54.200
 always wisdom and compassion. What is wisdom? Study, contemplation, meditation. There's,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:01.200
 oh, Buddhists talk about wisdom so much, so much. Prajna Paramita, it's just the perfection

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:09.960
 of wisdom is like the main thing. We're really so fortunate as Buddhists. And I'm not saying

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.920
 that's why other people are not good or something like that. But it's a different situation.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.800
 A lot of people are really looking for a path to wisdom and compassion. And as Buddhists,

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:26.200
 we already have it. It doesn't mean that's the path everyone should have. I'm definitely

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.800
 not saying that. But we have a path that will lead to full awakening of ourselves and all

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.920
 beings. It's already complete. There's all these practices, the eightfold noble path,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:44.180
 the four mind turnings, the four noble truths, the four boundless, recognizing the 12 links.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.400
 Looking at the three, all the six paramitas and unpacking the three caiyas into the five

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:56.880
 caiyas and the 25 wisdoms. And we have all so much dharma, so much wisdom. We're not

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.860
 to, there's one way, oh, it's just there for us. We're not having to figure out the fundamentals.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:12.200
 The Buddha taught these. There's like literal like libraries of books of these teachings.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:21.920
 And that way we're so fortunate, so fortunate. So to go for refuge. And this is refuge in

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:29.320
 a sense that this is not a sectarian thing. This is talking about wisdom, love and compassion.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:41.440
 These are just natural qualities of awareness. This is not a Buddhist tradition thing. For

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.960
 my mind, kind of going according to these words and these specific methods and these

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:53.760
 specific avenues of like exploration and inquiry, contemplation, opening, revelation, revealing,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:02.120
 like insight, like they work for my mind. I love them. Buddha dharma is really extraordinary.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.040
 And we should really kind of genuine, like kind of activate that kind of connection and

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:15.960
 the commitment, like that freshness. Because it's so easy to forget. It's so easy to just

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:22.360
 keep, look out, forget the special, kind of all the special things we have in our favor,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.240
 specifically including Buddha dharma and even more in our own Buddha nature, the Buddha

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.320
 nature of those beings around us. And the one way, a main way to do that, which we can

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:42.400
 do every day is really go for refuge, which we do in every single practice is Tibetan

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:50.960
 Buddhists as Theravada Buddhists, as Mahayana Buddhists, always refuge. So there's so many

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.640
 things to say. And then a simple thing that Venerable Kempa Ramachai emphasizes so much

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:07.940
 is a three noble ones. Noble beginning, noble middle, noble conclusion. And the noble, each

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:16.920
 of these sections, these three have two parts. The noble beginning is always refuge and bhorechitta

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.700
.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.480
 So we did that earlier. It's called in this way, it's called renunciation and bhorechitta.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.920
 Then the noble middle or the main part of a practice is always some in some ways talked

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:37.960
 about differently, shamatha and vipassana, kind of a concentration and insight practice.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:44.360
 In Tibetan Buddhism, that's called kram, zogram, or creation, completion. There's always the

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:54.160
 mind calmly abiding, settling, and then the awareness itself recognizing how it is naturally

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:01.400
 and being that way, being natural. There's always these two parts of a main practice.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:07.520
 So we could say, shamatha, vipassana, or concentration and insight. That's the noble middle. And

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:15.880
 the noble conclusion is always dedicating the merit, the positive virtue or energy, the

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:23.120
 goodness that just came, kind of was arisen and activated and displayed, that dedicating

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:31.040
 it for the enlightenment of every single being. With the genuine, kind of really genuine heartfelt

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:37.120
 care and concern, may this merit become the exact condition, the path, the supportive

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.880
 condition that will help every single mind throughout all the universe. May it connect

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.800
 up with each and every mind exactly in the perfect way to help that mind and that heart

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.720
 just open and flourish and have its own nature come out even more brightly until it's all

00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:01.120
 illumined, 100% bright, fully awakened. And then secondly, the aspiration. If I'm not

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.000
 enlightened now, which I'm definitely not, then we have to aspire to have more of that

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.440
 nature come out. So we make these aspiration prayers, that even if my virtue is teeny tiny

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.480
 from the practice, that I'm aspiring for it to be immense, infinite. I'm aspiring for

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.880
 my capacities to become infinite. All these qualities of serving the teachings and beings

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.760
 to become infinite. And there's so many prayers that have been recited by lineage masters

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.120
 over the centuries. And then we're just following in their footsteps, reciting their prayers,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.720
 kind of like connecting to that infinite quality of our own Buddha nature, and like more activating

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.720
 it, expanding it, basically stretching it, or kind of, we could once say, just like releasing

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.000
 this temporary kind of contraction that's holding it back. We're aspiring and kind

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.200
 of connecting to how it is much more vast and pervasive than we usually are kind of

00:34:52.200 --> 00:35:00.520
 allow for ourselves to be so amazing. We let ourselves be that amazing, aspire really big.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.960
 So always these three noble ones. This in one way includes the whole path of Buddhism.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:14.500
 Refuge and bodhicitta into samatan vipassana, concluded with dedication and aspiration prayers.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.440
 So this is to say refuge is really essential. And I haven't really said anything specifically

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:27.680
 about refuge. This is all just kind of general, like me highlighting how special refuge is.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:34.040
 The rare and supreme qualities of refuge, which are just galactically, like cosmically amazing

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:40.640
 when you really look at these qualities. Like this, really the six rare and supreme qualities

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:49.960
 of the of the jewel, the three jewels. They're extraordinary. And they're 100% reliable in

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:57.440
 all cases, in all times, for all genders, and all classes, and all races, and all epics.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:06.620
 We will always be reliable because the nature's pervasive. And the compassion, like the compassion

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:13.800
 that comes from this nature, is 100% flexible and reflects whatever is helpful in a situation.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:20.380
 It tunes into the exact things in a situation. It has that much love and skill. That's our

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.780
 own Buddha nature is that powerful. And that's what Buddhism does. That's what the Dharma

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:32.480
 does in general. It'll just flexibly adapt to whatever supports beings to be free of

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:39.360
 suffering in that specific context. It's how amazing. So here, we're just kind of trying

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.900
 to really kind of reactivate some of this connection, not require always a new thing,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:51.560
 some new amazing, shocking Dharma thing. Because if we just get in the habit of always needing

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:58.240
 the Dharma to wake us up, or the teacher to wake us up, or the world to wake us up, then

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:06.160
 we really have it backwards. And it's going to be an end big disappointment. Because we're

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.720
 the ones that need to wake up. We have to wake ourselves up. And we need help. We can

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:17.240
 ask for help. And there's so many things that will help us in Buddhism and in the world.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:24.360
 We should really pursue those. We should be helpful to others too. But in the end, I really

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:32.480
 do have to turn these qualities on in my own heart, in my own mind. And so we have this

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:39.400
 nature. We can settle into this nature. Both the really special, flexible qualities, that's

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:45.360
 called relative bodhicitta. And then the amazing, unchanging, absolute qualities, the ultimate

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:51.240
 refuge, which is called absolute bodhicitta. And that's in a more simple, even more simple

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.960
 way. It's all everything's bodhicitta, relative and absolute bodhicitta. And that's also why

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:03.940
 they call these really most profound teachings, which is just bodhicitta, the single sphere.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:10.520
 Tiglijempo, they said, Tiglijempo is the outer refuge, inner refuge, secret refuge, ultimate

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:18.200
 refuge altogether, which they say simply is bodhicitta. That's just a full package of refuge.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:25.040
 So just as an encouragement for ourselves to really take some time to really just connect

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.760
 with what we already have, who we already are, the teachings we've already received,

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.600
 and really brighten that, and let ourselves to really deepen our own relationship with

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:43.880
 what we already have, and have this depth, this more rich texture of our experience.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.760
 That's kind of my own personal encouragement really honestly to myself, and get in a slow

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:56.240
 and steady, that I won't always need to have some new thing kind of spark me up. But just

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:02.360
 if I regular get in a nice rhythm with the practice I already have, the teachings I've

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:08.280
 already connected to, and really honor what I've already received, in one way it kind

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:14.560
 of like met me. Now I really have to meet it. It has to go both ways. And so this slow

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.960
 and steady approach is to let that slow cook, to like really let that refuge open up, let

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:30.880
 the bodhicitta open up in my experience. And kind of like it'll come from the inside out.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:37.320
 So thank you, that's just kind of a short, kind of more like a general reflection, refuge.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:44.100
 And now we'll go to Dudrum Tersar and Nundra practice. So again, how amazing that such

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.160
 teachings exist. This terma revelation of this only is Dudrum Rinpoche. It's like so

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:58.360
 extraordinary. And we'll go to that now. We'll begin. It's on page 18. It's the calling

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.920
 the Lama from afar prayers written by as only as Dudrum Rinpoche, and then we'll go right

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:09.580
 into the Dudrum Tersar Nundra practice, and we'll do the whole practice together. Thank

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:27.720
 you so much. Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you all. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:33.620
 you. It's all good, really. I think I felt like it was just important to kind of come

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:40.920
 back to in one way, like these basics, like that is just a reminder to myself, mainly

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:50.680
 really, the three jewels are so close. And three roots are so close. Channels and wind

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:57.120
 essence elements are so close, the three guys are so close, like our nature is so close.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:03.600
 But it can be that our mind gets in the habit of kind of looking for something so obvious.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:10.720
 And so kind of tangible, in one way, so kind of disruptive, that we get used to just being

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.000
 in a reactive state. And then we kind of are always looking for what's going to cause us

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:24.320
 to react as if that like feels like I'm kind of really here and alive or something. But

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.880
 this kind of that's just kind of endless cycle of some sorrow. So just kind of that encouraging

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.920
 for myself really to just don't forget to like care for what's already here, what's

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:43.080
 already so close. This nature is always here, like in my mind, my heart is always here.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.800
 And Rinpoche said it very succinctly in like a beautiful way in their essential journey

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:55.840
 of life and death book. Really simply, on page 58, they said, "The nature of consciousness

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:02.800
 is absolute guru Padmasambhava, which doesn't change regardless of circumstances or whatever

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:10.360
 we experience. All the bardo visions, together with our conceptions, are the retinue of that

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:19.000
 nature. All our experiences are actually the retinue of absolute guru Padmasambhava. No

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.080
 matter where we look, absolute guru Padmasambhava is always with us. It's our nature and our

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:31.680
 beauty. And as Rinpoche said so many times, "If we remain in the pristine openness state

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:39.320
 of our nature, everything is the beautiful dynamic mandala of guru Padmasambhava." So

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:45.200
 just not wanting to forget that. So thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:05.080
