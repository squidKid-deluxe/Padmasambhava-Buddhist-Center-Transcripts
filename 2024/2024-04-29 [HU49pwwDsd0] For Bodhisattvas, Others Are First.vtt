00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.410
 Thank you very much for coming. Thank you so much. Thank you. Again, I continue teaching of our

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.320
 greatest, kindest, completion teacher for the Shakyamuni.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:27.260
 In his life, as great master Yang Muharu said, "Whatever the life remains in this time, it's your

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.360
 enlightenment activities. Praise to the very Shakyamuni. It's true, whatever life we have here,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.360
 love, kindness, completion,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.810
 whatever we learn from the Buddha teaching, it's truly the light of the Buddha, the light of his

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.120
 worship, that we are following in his life. We follow it as much as we can."

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.670
 And also not just following the light, but also we try to illuminate our inner life. As the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 greatest Shakyamuni said, we all inherit this beautiful nature.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 It's been waiting for us for a long time, for so many long times, waiting in the way of calling,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.590
 kind of a breakout call, calling us, and by the greatest teacher, we can now really try to activate

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.160
 this.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.970
 This again is so wonderful, it's so beautiful, it's so precious, and so special to our son, as well

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 as also others too.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.050
 The Buddha teaching, particularly Maya teaching, is dedicated for all the living beings, for they

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.080
 are prone, they are false, and we are the second true Bodhisattva.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.840
 First is all others, we are the second. And regularly in the human beings, or in our behavior, not

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.520
 just human beings, sentient beings, we are false. Others are second, third, fourth, something.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 But in the Bodhisattva, you put first all the beings, then we are second. That's what the teaching

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.740
 meant. So that's why, because of the power of compassion, loving kindness for all the sentient

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.080
 beings without any discrimination.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.010
 How greatest teacher in the Bodhisattva, they love all the sentient beings, in all places in the TV

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:12.010
, they love and kind and compassion as their only child, only child, mother's only child, how much

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.640
 they have to mess with love, compassion.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.220
 That's how all the Buddhas love, compassion, all the beings. So that's what the shared great wisdom

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.560
, and love and kindness, we are actually following this path.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 And other just only that, we are really touching to the goal of the true teaching. There's nothing

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.600
 higher, nothing deeper, not profound, nothing more direct than the Dokki teaching.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.760
 That's said by all those Bodhisattvas, all the great religion masters, one voice is not just making

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.000
 up that, it's true. There's nothing higher and deeper.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.480
 Today, we are connected to that. This is not just also what happened, it's helped. Truly this is

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.350
 our karma, our connection. We all have beautiful connection between teaching of the greatest

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.520
 teacher, Bodhisattva money, particularly the Gora Pema Sambha teaching, and as well as the Kumbh K

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.200
ipa teaching, all those teachings that were really following that.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.230
 So therefore, again, tremendous joy in the application in the heart and mind, feel happy joy, and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.950
 feel one of the four things really truly, and we use, we utilize these teachings truly to make the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.640
 difference, the difference in the samsara.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.340
 Samsara, our strength, and courage, and commitment, and confidence, and understanding, realization

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.560
 that all release makes you so different, truly.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.010
 And so with that, mind with vastness, motivation, the bodhisattva, all living with wishing, that

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.570
 sincerity. Of course, we all have the bodhisattva, we all try, we all know that, but it is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.920
 strengthen, it is reactivating, it is renewing, it is practices.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.390
 Our bodhisattva is, I mean, we have all that, we know that, but it is also dim and dull, dull or it

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.260
 is blurred with our habit patterns of all the different things, it just become kind of almost like

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.800
 fading away, to activating that, activating, glorifying that in our heart, mind, and vastness,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.440
 motivation of the bodhisattva for all living beings.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.980
 Today, I am going to reflect teaching, and I am going to practice and meditate, I am going to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.810
 benefit for all sentient beings, also I am going to get enlightenment, to benefit for all the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.070
 sentient beings, having those beautiful motivations, vastness, vastness, motivation of the bodhis

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.480
attva.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.830
 And then again, you say, third one is the very end of motivation, particularly Dzogchen's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.850
 realization, and this is re-chachi, reconnecting our inner qualities, and that one, our inner

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.920
 qualities, true, natural mind, is a three kaya status.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.090
 As three kaya status, we also activate that whole universe is in a three kaya status. It is not

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.120
 something different in that.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.050
 What we are perceiving, what we are perceiving, we perceive ourselves individually, so all the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.760
 poems, all the songs and the spaces are within the Dzogchen's kaya status, that is the whole, the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.120
 entire universe is within the enlightened state.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.480
 It is not just made up by the world, by the world, visualization, meditation, counting, we count,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.620
 ten hundred, we reconnect with that, visualization, but actually, really, it is in the teaching

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.120
 state, it is already enlightened state.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.900
 For that reason, a great master, known as Varya Phemus, the techno and the master, and the eman

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.080
ation of the Verojana, the great athlete of the Verojana's emanation, his name was Trungvotechichir

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.120
abhosa.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.680
 Maybe you didn't hear that name before. Trungvotechichirabhosa is really Phemus, again, Tehtung,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.120
 and scholars, too. Varya Phemus scholars, too.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:18.150
 And he was also a rude teacher, a teacher to the very Phemus Rongkadhi lineage master, called Rongv

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.120
otechichirabhosa.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.140
 He was also a great yogi, and a tehtung, and a scholar, too. But his rude teacher was Trungvotech

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.120
ichirabhosa.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:41.340
 In his one of the teaching, he said, this, this, this, this, this universal world is already,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.120
 really enlightened state, enlightened state.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:55.120
 This is not, we created, or we cannot try to activate it, they buy, buy the words, W-O-R-D, word,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.120
 that means prayer, visualization, or see these things, this and that.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:09.490
 This is not ordinary, in ordinary. It naturally is enlightened state. For Buddha, for Buddha, what

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.120
 Buddha sees every day is enlightened state.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:22.120
 Why? Because Buddha discovered exactly absolutely in the nature of the, of the mind.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:29.120
 They have to see everything. We don't see this right moment, because due to the dualities.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.170
 But otherwise, what the Buddha sees, that is the one with our, we're going to see, or that is the

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.120
 one is really seeing.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:47.120
 So they have to activate it, that is the trick I say. That is the essential practices.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.120
 Many times he says pure vision, pure vision, but it's not just pure vision.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:00.340
 Of course, for duality beings, we have to do that, to usher us, to ignite that reality, nature, as

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.120
 it is.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 We have to ignite, as with pure vision, or pure perceptions. But reality is pure already.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.120
 What we are only going to be present, we are purifying purely our dualities.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:23.120
 The universe is perfectly fine according to teaching. Nothing is really in view.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:30.120
 Only we purify our duality, consumption, what we purify.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:37.990
 So that's the reality. So again, in the Doki teaching, teaching is to reactivate those qualities is

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.120
 so important, and that is our practices.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 Now with this, now we go.
