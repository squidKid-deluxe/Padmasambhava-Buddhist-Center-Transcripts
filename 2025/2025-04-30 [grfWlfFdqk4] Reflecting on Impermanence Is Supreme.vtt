In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 In his essay, the post preliminary practices or the foundation practices is to prepare

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.640
 ourself.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.520
 That is to prepare ourself.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.520
 So to prepare ourself.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 So those are what we discussed in that.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 And now we go to the now here, the external ordinary foundation practices of the seven

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.720
 training of the minds.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.000
 So Munro is in Tibetan and Amla is now translating also foundations.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Foundation practice.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.920
 Munro is a foundation.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.720
 Foundation practices and Munro is also not just a foundation, this is also in the middle

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 practice too.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.040
 Every time practices we do that, so is the foundation practices.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:09.760
 So now second is the external ordinary training of the seven training of the mind or seven

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 mindful practices, seven mindful practices.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.400
 And now what are those?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.280
 Those are here.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 In the Tibetan of course, they're all component things are in permanent like the water bubbles.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.900
 And this is all called ordinary or the extra ordinary practices, the ordinary.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.480
 But it is all is generally is not just a kind of like esoteric for the buddhisms.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.400
 It is it's poor, whether you're a Buddhism or whether you're Buddhist practitioners or

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.360
 not practitioners, this is the reality of the way every things are the most least.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.120
 And of course, there's like the supreme part of the path or the Nirvana and as well as

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.520
 qualify a teacher, those are slightly different.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.240
 But otherwise, all is really just to everyone, I mean that whether you believe or not believe

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960
 that's the way we are we are.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.520
 And in the general practice is what it calls poor point of the teaching that will reverse

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.560
 our mind from the samsara.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.640
 So it will kind of like that, something then clinging grasping to the samsara.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.120
 And so our mind will turn to the Dharma practices that if we start reflecting these things,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
 these points.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.900
 So therefore, this is this mindfulness practices as well as well uproot our grasping, clinging

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.680
 or attitude toward samsara.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.360
 It is also not making up.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.700
 It is exactly true as it is.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.320
 So now I hear all component things are the impermanence like the water bubbles.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.000
 Now, what is that means all the components.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.760
 So that means this all what we see now, all compounded things.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.600
 What is compounded in a debating or in Buddhism, Buddha's teaching in philosophy, then you

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.360
 say what is the symbol of the compounded or what is the characteristics of the compounded.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:40.120
 The characteristic or the symbol of the compounded is moment you existing, that moment is changing.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.600
 Moment you existing, that moment is changing.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 There is no pause, no change.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.160
 Moment is existing, moment is change.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:03.280
 Only that is the characteristics of the whole symbol of the compounded everything.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:12.520
 In that way, there is true impermanence, that means the impermanence is changing impermanence.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:22.660
 That is in the compounded again if you talk that all this world outside, all this world

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:33.160
 phenomena existing, water, fire, wind, earth, every these four elements, everything is changing.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:42.080
 Not really looking to our post-eagle poems, our breathings, our mind and everything really

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 changing.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.840
 So four elements are changing externally, four elements are changing inward, not sitting

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.720
 anything.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.720
 And that change has two, something that we can detect it, something that we cannot detect

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:08.880
 it, there is undetectable impermanence that is called subtle impermanence, undetectable.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.400
 Our senses are so gross, gross we don't detect that subtle impermanence.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.840
 As in the teaching said, as I said, the moment you existing that moment is changing, we don't

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 detect that.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.400
 That is subtle impermanence, we don't detect it.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 We only detected gross ones, gross that comes from where?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:48.200
 From subtle, subtle impermanence, that word gross, then we see all the change, changing.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.960
 Our eyes are or our consciousness, our mind, intelligence is gross.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 And who detect that?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.840
 According to Buddhism, those one who has a realization of the first booming, they detect

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.920
 it, they will detect and then come more deeper, more stronger and sharper and then Buddhas

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.120
 are detected.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:25.600
 And our eye, what use the examples, for example, one hair, hair, H-A-I-R, hair, dropped that

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.080
 on the palm, we won't detect it.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:39.560
 One slide, hair, detect, blood, dropped in our palm, we won't detect, we won't feel anything.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:49.560
 But that same side, every drop in our eye, immediately we will feel, immediately we will

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 see.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.320
 So the knowledge of the enlightened beings are like eyes, immediately they see things,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.240
 where things are happening.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.880
 Our knowledge is gross, we don't really detect anything yet.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.120
 So this is the way the nature is, phenomena existing is, moment you develop, that moment

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.120
 is started changing.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.560
 Now we start thinking of the gross ones, gross in parliament, then in the teaching, see it.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:32.040
 Then you think, reflecting the mind in parliament, the gross level, thinking of the world, whole

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:41.560
 world, how whole world is changed, and we read the history, how much world is changed.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:48.440
 In even our lifetime, this world is changing so much.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:58.640
 So reflecting the mind, how the mind, world is changing and reflecting the mind from us

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:06.160
 to how inhabitant of the world is changing, that's the second.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.680
 Then reflecting the mind of the in parliament, how all those noble beings are changed.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.760
 All noble beings, those are considered very high in the noble, enlightened, more kind

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.000
 of, not like us, more special beings.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.600
 Those are innovating to be such as those great Lamas, His Holiness.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.880
 And then in a different page, you have noble ones.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.600
 How much changed?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.640
 Reflecting the mind, all the noble ones.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.160
 Reflecting the in parliament meant all the power of ones in the world.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:59.280
 Those were so powerful, so strong, so rich, so majestic.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.760
 And so kind of things do by just by word or by signal, they can change so many things.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.080
 And how much things change, all those all go.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:20.360
 And then reflecting the generality in parliament, how much change in our own lives since the

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.880
 beginning of time, since I have the memories until now.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 How many things changed?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 Oh, one after another life, it's just like, in that way, if you look at how many things

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.440
 changed, it's just like moving everything, so speed of light, really changing completely.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.960
 If somebody is walking on the other side of the mountain or in the space to look into

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.160
 this world, what things changing in all the individuals, it changes.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:03.840
 It just so fast, so moving, everything is like that, that, so all.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:12.120
 And then our own self, reflecting to our own self, how many things changed since I was,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:21.000
 the memories, or even 15, 20 years ago, how much we changed things, things.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.920
 And everyone is changing, this is not stopping here, no stopping is continually changing.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.560
 So therefore, life is precious, life is fragile.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:47.240
 Fragile, great master Nagarjuna said, in his teaching, teaching said, life is so fragile,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.960
 it has so many opponents.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:58.040
 Opponents surround everything, the kind of daylight wind blowing, and life is so fragile

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.200
 and it tend to, it's like butter lane, our lives, but blowing air and wind, so many things

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:15.120
 happen every direction, but still the fragile light is still lightning or still light, still

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.680
 is not glowing.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:26.000
 How amazing, how wonderful, it's true, that reason we should feel joy, appreciation, our

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.640
 life is so precious.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:36.480
 And what great master Maharam Mooji said in his teaching, teaching said, life is so difficult

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.960
 to find this precious life, it's more difficult than it used in his Buddha teaching, they're

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.400
 called plover, called adhanvara.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:54.400
 Life is more rare than adhanvara, plover, difficult to find.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:02.960
 Once you obtain that, it is so valuable, so precious, then which purpose is jewel?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.480
 The purpose that all the witches, whatever you desire, according to Buddha's teaching,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:17.280
 there is a jewel, jewel, that if you have that, if you glorify honor that on the kind

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.040
 of spatial way to glorify that and wish what you want, it will bring everything.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.960
 If you want wealth, it will bring wealth, if you want beautiful clothes, it will bring

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.320
 beautiful clothes, if you want gold, it will bring gold, silver, jewel, all those things,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.320
 that's called wishful for the jewel in the Buddha teaching.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:47.360
 So what great master Maharam Mooji said, life is more precious than wishful for the jewels,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:55.760
 so difficult to obtain than the adhanvara, plover, and so precious than the wishful for

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:04.480
 the jewel, we got both, rare things we got got, we got so precious things we got.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:12.720
 Now what great master Maharam Mooji said, may I have the courage to use this for the

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.760
 beautiful purpose.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.960
 May I make the meaning form of this life.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.880
 That's what really in the teaching said that, I mean this is not just Maharam Mooji said,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:33.880
 it's true, our life is so precious, so difficult to find, and also for idols, but still we're

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:40.960
 here, we're doing good things, how wonderful, how special, thankful, grateful, we see that

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.680
 everyone have that similar situation, what we have, but at the same time have courage

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:53.640
 and commitment, confidence, that I'm going to use this for beautiful purposes, to reach

00:13:53.640 --> 00:14:01.000
 enlightenment, become Buddha, or help all the beings, really through the bodhicata talks,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.840
 as following the path, and guidelines in light of all the great teachings, Buddha and enlightenment

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:07.840
,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.760
 and follow the path, if we make those things as much as we can, then truly we're making

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:19.590
 the meaning for our life, that's called meaning for life, we're not resting, taking the

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.080
 opportunities.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.160
 This doesn't mean that you have to give up everything, or do something, yes, be more

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:34.220
 thoughtful, more calm, more peaceful, more content, do the good things to benefit for

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.160
 all beings as much as you can, and each time do good aspiration prayer, dedication prayer,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.520
 really time, and which more I can do, and calm and peaceful, humble and simple, that

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.760
 is known as the following the path of the great teacher, Buddha Chakra Manish, and old

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:01.200
 enlightenment, so that is the brilliant of the first one, first one is called, and then

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.400
 is like fragile, as like water bubble, so the water bubble, that, and then also in the teaching

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.200
 said, all this universe and world is like, what Buddha graciously, Buddha effect, I'm

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.560
 going to give example of this universe and world, all commodity things, is it like star,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.760
 it's used, this everything is like stars, that means the stars are shining in the nighttime,

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.640
 but during the daytime we don't see, so it's like kind of short time display, come on,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.880
 come on, rub, rub, and then also what's called the double images, university is like double

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:52.960
 images, is it like water lens, then is it like magic, is it like doo, D-E-W doo, and

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.740
 then water bubbles, water bubble here, and then is all this experience in the universe

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:11.680
 is like dream, and it's all as like clothing in the sky, this all like is like all that

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.000
 lightning, it's like lightiness, those are the, I think, eight different examples, the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.600
 greatest teacher Buddha mentioned, the example of this universe and the world, we are like

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.760
 this, really like that, so reflecting those thought, and in the teaching said, is so good,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.320
 and what the greatest teacher Buddha said, among all the concepts of your thought, conception

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:39.380
 of the impermanent is supreme, really said, supreme is a spirit, it is a conception, is

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.160
 a thought, is a mindfulness practice, but this will make our heart more tender, more

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.840
 simple, and then so we have more good heart, good heart to ourselves, good heart to others,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.200
 and so those are the teaching said, and I will stop here today, thank you, thank you

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:04.280
 everyone, thank you, thank you, and we have some questions we discuss at your time, and

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.080
 no that's fine.
