00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.900
 "From here, there is the post-meditation exercise, and that means always keep that motivation. Keep

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.760
 that awareness and realization with our own awareness. Be aware of it."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.850
 "So that means here, taste it. Whatever you do, you drink. Whether you are sleeping, whether you

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.800
 are standing, whatever you are performing, if you can, occasionally, really look to your mind."

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 "Where you are walking, where you are sitting, even you are doing some functioning and things, but

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.440
 if you can, look to your own mind."

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.560
 "What do you see? Again, it will reactivate your meditation, what you discover, the nature of the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 mind."

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:02.450
 "And then, what the great Master Chakra Chodoro said in the teaching, when you are relaxing on the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:12.170
 nail, neck, your mind, and doing the performing of some jewels or activities, then it looks almost

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 like it is all dream."

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.070
 "Mind is empty, and activity, all is also a kind of dream activity, really. You begin to see that.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.780
 Begin to see. And those are good seeing. Those are according to teaching. That's the way things are

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.200
."

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 "And so, then everything becomes. And during that time, then also, again, is the blessings of the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.230
 devotion. And again, it sits here, so I won't have trouble. I mean, we all know this. This is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200
 already been making many time to do the practices."

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.150
 "And now, do the devotion, so that means devotion practices, really, those all with thought of the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.240
 bodhicitta, great joy in appreciation of the grateful bodhicitta, devotion, those are all so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 important we can do that during the post-meditation."

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.070
 "Those are also known as the accumulation merits. There are two merits, we all heard that. Accum

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.430
ulation merits, worship merits, these are our devotion, our joy, our appreciation, our bodhicitta,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.200
 our thought, and that intention. And all those are known as meritually, accumulation merits."

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.250
 "Merit, so therefore, combination of the worship merits and accumulation merits, then, really,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.200
 realization will come. So, easily, beautiful."

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:56.000
 "And so, then, continually, that our devotion, our motivation is so important, and for that reason,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.810
 and again, great Master explained in the page 27, also is devotionally and during the service with

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.200
 devotion to the three duels, whether dharma sangha and do physical activities."

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.340
 Many times, before we said, "Oh, I don't have the time to do practice because I'm helping all the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 three duels or making service to the three duels, but every have the good heart with joy and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 devotion."

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.650
 "This is what great Master said, this really will bring more benefit to realization than even just

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.200
 sitting without it, to good, not more, can't do, activated, meditation, meditating."

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.610
 "So, it will bring more benefit, which is oscillated there. So, therefore, it sit here, and that's

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:43.460
 you. You can see this. This is very important. That is, for example, if we use, for example, malare

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.200
va."

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.450
 Malareva, according to the teaching, he said so many years, maybe nine years or ten years, with mal

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.200
areva. During that time, what he did, he's walking.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.900
 He's helping and supporting and drawing the jewels, what Marpa said, and then, of course, the great

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.260
 Master Marpa is not always happy with malareva, but comes again in the years in school and says, "

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.200
You didn't do right, correct, but now you have to do this and that."

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.190
 But this and that, things really did that. But according to the teaching, according to many of us,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:32.040
 that because his dedication, courage, and commitment, his devotion of the two thousand malareva, he

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.200
 never changed, lingered the mind during that times.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.030
 And that purified his obscurations. When he went to the retreat, hermitage, then he immediately

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.030
 boost up his realization or shine up there. This is one example of that, walking, helping with them

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.200
 to others.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.800
 This means bodhijata activity. Generally, helping with the sharing of the Bodhada Dharma Sangha is

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.200
 activity of the poor to benefit others, beings. So it's bodhijata activity.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:32.470
 Then we looked to the, what's it called? The Talopas. The Talopas. Again, sorry, Naropas. Naropa,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.710
 the other day we're talking, he again went all through, he counter with the Talopa and in the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.890
 teaching he said, and he said so many years, I don't remember exactly the number of years, but so

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.200
 many years,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:42.530
 during that time, Talopa did not give one word of teachings. Teachings, teachings, except all

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.200
 things to have to do that made so much trouble to Naropa, one after another.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.130
 Many times, with our folks, now we think, oh, Talopa is crazy. Talopa is crazy, and Talopa is doing

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.200
 all these things, why he do this and all that things, but Naropa did not get any really hesitation.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:11.290
 Hesitation, doubt, anything. He continually did, served teacher as he wanted, as he asked to do,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.200
 and then he got the realization.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:22.030
 And then, of course, there's another, there's so many others, and for example, it's very famous,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.030
 the new master who came in the late 19th century, early 20th century, he was master or the root

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.200
 teacher of the great temple, temple Makchung.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:42.060
 Makchung, and he's, Khipun Makchung is a large story, of the Otro, Otro, Otro bio-rock is

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.200
 translated into English, I think it's called medical dance.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.680
 Wondrous dance of allusions. Wondrous dance of allusions. That large story is really one of the

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.200
 best life stories of Otro Barakas, so powerful, so beautiful.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.770
 When you read, of course you see what the temple Makchung did, but also it tells, tells so much

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.200
 teachings, it can absorb in our heart and mind, it's really beautiful.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.420
 These great masters, and also in these great masters, considering emanation of the Brahman Mathur

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:32.990
 and the Lumkipa, truly was very great masters. He was also one of the root teachers of his Holiness

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.200
, Jadarumut.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.990
 Jadarumut, that very famous Lumkipa master, that was passed three years ago, so his Jadarumut is

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.200
 teacher's teacher.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:51.290
 Yochu Lungdo, this large story of the magical illusion dance of what? Wondrous dance of allusion.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:57.200
 Wondrous dance of the illusion in that teaching, explained many times of the, his teachers say,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200
 like, teaching, teaching by Kimbong, literally, many times, explaining that.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:11.050
 So this Kimbong, this Yochu Lungdo, is the disciple, the foremost disciple of the popular Rummusch,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.200
 was foremost disciple.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:24.020
 He stayed with the popular Rummusch, popular Rummusch, I think maybe 20 years, and serving popular

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.200
 Rummusch. Of course popular Rummusch is hermitage.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.200
 Very simple, not like the lupa, not like Marbak. Very gentle and peaceful, yet he's been serving.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.200
 Serving, helping him is.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 Kimbong, the new Yochu Lungdo, is really one of the great masters, also his teachings.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:56.110
 Teachings, so powerful, so strong, strong, and also so knowledgeable. He was also a student of Marb

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.200
ak too. He's a teacher from Marbak too.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.550
 But it's really powerful, because of also, he's not just went to the academic school and started

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.200
 and then become that great scholar, great meditator, and made it in so many caves.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 But he's been serving, helping or serving the popular Rummusch, or as attendance.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.200
 And the teaching says that one time, there is very shortage of the teas.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:33.150
 In the way the tea leaves are, at that time, not always easy to get tea leaves, because they have

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.200
 to come from China or either India.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:46.360
 So then, they have a small amount of tea, and Yochu Lungdo, the teacher of the Kimbong Makyong, is

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.200
 making tea for part of the rummusches.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:58.200
 So they put one tea, whatever put the tea on the board, and then they make the tea.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.200
 And morning tea is really very good, nice color and flavor, all that good.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.200
 Then that same tea leaves, they use again in the mid days.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.200
 Then it gets weaker, of course, it gets weaker and weaker.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:21.200
 Then even at the time, they make that same tea leaf and use again, like cheese.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
 Then it's really very weak.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.200
 So what part of the rummusches say, "Oh, we're going to have three coyotes, three coyotes."

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:38.290
 Morning tea is Nirmakaya tea, or Sambokaya tea, and Apranthu tea is Sambokaya tea, and evening tea

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.200
 is Dharmakaya tea.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.200
 At one time, they also had some, because they practice on hermitage.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:55.090
 So in the winter time, sometimes those devotees like to bring the food, it's kind of difficult to

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.200
 get places.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.200
 So they made practices, and they had also already a short food.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.200
 A short food becomes very kind of small.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:14.200
 And then at that time, he had one bowl of his disciples,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200
 has one kind of size of butter.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.200
 In Italy, they make the butter, because it's not like a bowl of butter.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 So where he got that butter, his mother gave him.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.200
 His mother gave him that bowl of butter, a bowl of butter.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:47.860
 So then Nyukil Nodoh is offering that butter, and from that butter, to every day, to popular rummus

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.200
ches.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.200
 And one day he asked, "Where have you got this kind of steady-looking butter?"

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 "Where have you got this butter?"

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.200
 He said, "I've got this from my mother."

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:08.200
 He said, "Oh, are you meditating on the mother? How kind is this?"

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 He said, "He's not drawing too much."

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 "Oh, you should do that. Look at this. Mother did this."

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.200
 "Why did this happen?" "Because the mother is also poor."

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.200
 Nyukil Nodoh mother is poor. She has only one pimal yaks.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 And from that one pimal yak, when he was a milk counter, he made the butter,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.200
 and he put one butter here, a small one there, and he added the next day or whatever there.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 Add the butter today, and next day add butter.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 So many days collected butter, so therefore he's kind of strange and all that.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.200
 So that's the how. And because of the reminding of that butter,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 and then Nyukil, the butter told,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.200
 you go other side of the wood and meditate it for seven days

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.200
 about the kindness of all the mothers.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.200
 So he did that. In the teaching he said,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 so this is, again, this is just a story of the service of the three Jewels.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200
 He really bring a lot of realization. I mean, it's unbelievable that in the teaching said.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 That's what he said.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.200
 And then, I mean, this all, like that, you know.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 And now, and then here, in the bed, 29.
