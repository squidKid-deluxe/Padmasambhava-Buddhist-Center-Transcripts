00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.350
 Thank you very much for coming, and thank you very much for also giving me this opportunity to be

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.820
 with you all,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.760
 with you all here, and as well as in many other places, wherever you are, we are all connected.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.050
 And also I like to say everyone, good afternoon, or good morning, or whatever your time zone is,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.300
 are basically all the best.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 This is one of the very, very difficult and strange situations that we all went through this.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.740
 One way is bring all of us together, so we can also become as one within the one and the other,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.040
 united together, with the teachings of the Buddha Dharma and Gaurabhama Samba and their blessings.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.160
 So therefore, it is in that way, it is a kind of brand new dimension, or new ideas, or new

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.500
 situation, so that we can really connect it,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.110
 and put our teachings into the practices. Always we receive so many teachings from many great

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.160
 masters, one after another.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 Everyone taught us to put teaching into the practices. So this is really the good time that we put

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.820
 practice, practice together.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.420
 And also many times, I myself heard many times, my Sangha members and friends always mentioned that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 I wish I have some opportunity to do retreat,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.040
 but I did not have this situation. I feel kind of bad.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.400
 But even though it is strange time situation, but it really is opening a new door, particularly

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.440
 those who are practitioners in the Buddha,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.160
 to follow the teaching of the Buddha in the Gaurabhama Samba, retreat is a very, very popular

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.740
 practices and popular systems in all those ancient great masters.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.620
 From the ancient time to the greatest teacher, Buddha Chaturmani, until now, so many people are

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.140
 practicing and doing retreat.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.120
 That means teaching what they received is not just putting merely as satisfactions of the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 intellectual or knowledge,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.990
 but observing that teaching into the heart and practices, converting the both each other, kindly to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.840
 complete thought for all living beings.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.530
 It does not matter what you believe, what are the traditions, customs or language we speak, but now

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.740
 at this time the whole world is really going through the same situation.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.650
 The state and everyone. There is no kind of leading exceptions for the reach or the knowledge, the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.840
 learned ones or uneducated ones.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.820
 It is the really time we took our old teachings and now in heart and make that something so special

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.140
, beautiful.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.640
 The outcome will be really beautiful, and to benefit ourselves, might to help others, so that I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.340
 really like to encourage you, all of us, myself and everyone,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.550
 take this opportunity as to improve and grow and deepen our teaching of the Buddha Dhamma that we

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.740
 received, received and activated at this time.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.440
 And also followed all the systems, the guidelines, the experts, explaining that we should follow

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.240
 that at the same time to kind of raise up our spiritual Dhamma practices.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.980
 In the greatest teachings, the Buddha Dhamma is often mentioned that to cure the disease, make

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.140
 perfect healthy, healthy.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.640
 There is such as food, conduct, medicines and meditation practices.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:15.140
 Those are all those targeted to help to sustain the growth of our thinking of the body.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.060
 It will help to sustain strong and healthy body, but at the same time, healthy mind, healthy spirit

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.040
, so that we can really benefit and make nice to others, everyone.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.280
 So therefore, I would just like to encourage you, this is really kind of a very unexpected and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.740
 strange situation.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.840
 We brought all together and then used this time, brought together and used this time for practices.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.340
 And many times what the great master said is true.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.640
 The difficulty troubles of the brain, the drift of the human well, and they call it richness.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.240
 And this many times happened.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.160
 Ancient time, so many of those great masters who reached high realization, but at the beginning

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.240
 time, they went to so many challenges.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.840
 It is difficult to one up or another. Even when they are growing time in the families, one up or

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.640
 another.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:20.140
 But that pushed them so much, brought strong courage and commitment, confidence and determination

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:29.340
 to explore the meaning of very distressed lives, to benefit themselves, to all the beings.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:37.060
 Wide kindness, compassion, love, that's what we received teaching from the great master, the Buddha

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.240
.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.240
 That's really the teaching.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.540
 So it's really both that spiritual and dharmic qualities in the heart and mind.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.380
 So therefore, we should not be totally kind of like discipline and upset, but raise up our spirit

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.540
 and courage and commitment and held our heads high.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.440
 And we follow every guidelines and every system.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.520
 So whatever needs you do, both expertise and instruction, as well as our practice of teaching that

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.440
 you and me and everyone is able to put that into practice.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.640
 So I think I just thought to talk that to all of us in a way reminding to you.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.840
 You all know these things.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.440
 I'm not talking something completely new things, but just reminding to all of us.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.440
 And thank you very much again.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.240
 We are with a target with here, all the Sangha members in Pima Samyalai.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.740
 We all are really well and good health.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.740
 Everyone is following so beautifully, cautiously, mindfully, all the guidelines.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.540
 And we are also very well and happy to be your own and to get the practices.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.440
 So thank you.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.540
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.040
 Now I'm going to join some prayers.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.940
 Many of you know that I do some prayers before I talk.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.840
 And then those people, people maybe don't know exactly what I'm doing now.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.790
 I'm going to join some prayers that because what I'm going to talk is not just something I've

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.340
 invented and I'm speaking.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.740
 But this is the teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Chapter Muni.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.940
 Gonna be a symbol of all the great masters, their teachings.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.140
 So I follow it there, kind of the instruction and the guidelines as much as I can.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.040
 My best capabilities before I talk, I honor them.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.840
 And where I'm speaking, maybe it becomes something meaningful.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.820
 And also may I stay in the purple in the line of the teaching of the greatest teachers are laid out

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.140
.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.040
 So those are the really purpose.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.740
 I'm going to join to prayers and those people who know those prayers and please join with me.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.040
 Otherwise, I will pray this.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.540
 Please meditate and relax in a natural state of your mind.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.240
 And then we'll be together.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240
