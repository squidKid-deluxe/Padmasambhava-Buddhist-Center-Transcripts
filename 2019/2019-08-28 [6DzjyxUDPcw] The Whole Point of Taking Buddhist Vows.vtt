00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Now, I just want to tell you this, of course, this whole list of the many, many numbers, one up,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.500
 another this.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.760
 But it's just, of course, we're starting now. We're starting there, that's what we're learning and

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.500
 going through all this, this one up, as much as it can, or we can, in our time then.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:29.340
 But otherwise, most of us is lay practitioners, or pastas, lay practitioners. So this is not

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.500
 something that you have to completely know that.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 But if you know that a bit, as much as roughly that you have understand, then it's really good,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 good.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.380
 Because one of the teachings, I will tell those later that, but this will bring a little more, kind

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.000
 of like mindfulness, alertness, and of course, you know, it will help our practice in meditation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 So even though it's a lot of many numbers and this and that, you don't have to really concern and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 worry.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.490
 I know, yeah, everywhere I go or teach, when we talk a lot of numbers, and people kind of feel that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.050
 Even though you've all been in the college and started in the university and all that, I'm sure

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.500
 there's a lot of list of numbers explaining this and that in college.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 But then still, kind of like people are kind of not so excited with the numbers.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 And so I know that, that is.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 Also for me, it's kind of like one after another, according to two different languages or thinking

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.500
 in the Tibetan language and talking in English sometimes.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.770
 Sometimes it's a little bit of mixing up and all that, not flowing so well that I know this, it's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 kind of a little bit hard.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.290
 But at least recollecting to the recording and the teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyam

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.600
uni, is teaching on the really love and kindness and compassion, how we improve ourself and benefit

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.500
 to others.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.980
 As much as we can remember and as much as we can think, it is really good. It is like a round cake,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.500
 round cake.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 Small bite is delicious, big bite is delicious. It's just delicious.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 So don't have to really kind of concern or I don't remember this and that.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.990
 But even the smallest thing just is really big benefit. It's just helping. It just rains to the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.500
 heart, rains to the air so nicely.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 Oh, that's really true. I mean, it's also so practical.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.340
 The Buddha, I mean, I said in teaching and it's also in the Buddhist book making that, Buddha never

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.500
 made the rules.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.550
 These whole rules, this happened. It's not really like Buddha made the rule and then saying that, "

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.500
Oh, I created this, I'm happening."

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.500
 It's everything is really happening at that time.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.730
 And many great masters said that happened, thank you, really said otherwise we won't have the rules

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.500
 like this.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 Because when I had this, most of this also happened and so many of those detailed things happened

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 because of these six naughty monks and twelve naughty monks.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 Nuns.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 Nuns, sorry, twelve naughty nuns created that they did and the Buddha said, "No, not that."

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 But if they didn't act, this won't happen and then we can make all these mistakes.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 Our morality, our conduct will become not so pure, so refined.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 Even this clearly mentioned, we won't be able to keep all these things.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 It's not just only us in the teaching said it's very difficult to keep all this.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:45.220
 What the great master Ravakshi said, great master is one of the great masters in the Tibetan

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.500
 Buddhist history, really very famous.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.620
 He became very famous in his lifetime. So they asked him, "All the great masters, they can do a lot

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.500
 of miracle activities, miracle activities.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 Master, you will do miracle activities. Would you show us some miracle activities?"

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500
 The student asked.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.220
 He said, "My miracle activities are keeping vows perfectly beautiful. That is my miracle activities

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.500
."

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.930
 That's what he said. He said, "The old man, able to maintain the perfect vows of the Vinaya, and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.500
 that is my miracle activities."

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 And later on, all the great masters, all the great masters take that quotations.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 It's true, true. He kept it so perfectly beautiful according to them.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 And similarly, the one who wrote this root text is Vinod. He kept it so perfectly beautiful vows.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.520
 To keep in detail vows and all that is difficult, particularly when he is more difficult in the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.500
 teaching said.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.270
 What the great master Atihya said when he came to bed, he told him to be able to keep perfectly Vin

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.500
aya rules. Perfect.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.500
 But when he came to the bodhisattva yanas, he became kind of a little bit sloppy.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 When he came to this Vaidyan vow, then very sloppy. He told this great master.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.170
 So it's very, many times we both think, "Oh, Vaidyan vow is so easy. Also you can do this and that

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.500
."

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.500
 That is very mistakes, pretty mistakes. This all included, these vows, what we're talking here,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.500
 they included Vaidyan vow. All that.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.500
 So therefore, we have a little bit of knowledge. Let me shine on the knowledge.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.650
 And we know that ignorance is bliss, but ignorance is bliss. It's not that bliss. It's forever

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.500
 bliss.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 This makes, "Oh, let it shine on the light, on the surface."

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500
 And we know a little bit on that. Really, really good.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.820
 I remember, I think, this great, this Mongolian, Gephi said, "When I don't know the Vinaya, I have

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.500
 the vow."

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 She said, "She's true." He don't know. He didn't say that, but ignorance is bliss.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
 So he said, "It's comfortable."

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.500
 But when he read the Vinaya, he said, "My vow is gone."

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
 So that's the thinking. So it's good. Really okay. Thank you.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.300
 And then, we talked about what's called now, the stupid side, but we're having, I'm sure they

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.500
 already know that.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.500
 But we have a really nice view to another.
