00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 Thank you, Rinpoche. I actually had two questions. One is the first when you're talking about

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.760
 the three types of paths, the long, short, and the very brief. It seems like in all of

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.120
 those paths, then a lot of karma has to be purified, regardless. So could you talk a little

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.400
 bit about the difference in how the techniques of those three paths, like the Sutra Mahayana,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.240
 Vajrayana, and Dzogchen, how it purifies karma more quickly, and what we can expect that to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.320
 be like? All of these have to be, of course, karma is true. We have to purify karma. But

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.360
 more than karma, we have to purify two obscurations that you heard, two obscurations. And one

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.480
 are two obscurations. Two obscurations are the emotional obscurations and knowledge obscurations.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.160
 And this karma is in emotional obscurations. Karma is all, is within the territory of the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.680
 according to the teaching, is in emotional obscurations, or in a new movement, japa,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 hip, the japa. So it's in a new movement, japa. So to reach to the Buddhahood, everyone has to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:31.040
 purify these two obscurations. And that is, in the teaching said, for example, in the Sutra

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.480
 Mahayana teaching, as we said, I mean, not I'm just saying, in the teaching said, is long distance,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.440
 reaching enlightenment, long, long distance or long path. Because why they call it three

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.400
 countless eons, three countless eons. So three countless eons, so then the path. Now you're

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.080
 practicing, now you're practicing your cleansing the emotions, emotions, according to teaching,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 teaching the first, for example, now we follow the five paths. Five paths, when you're practicing

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.080
 accumulation path, now you're practicing. Your realization level is healing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.280
 of the true nature, or the emptiness, we don't really have perfectly understand of the,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.160
 of the emptiness, or the true, true or the emptiness. Perfectly, but in a, in a,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.440
 in a team. But we didn't work, because you've examined, you see the teaching, you've examined

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.720
 your own contemplation, you find this, perfectly is fine, that's true, and then you practice this.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.480
 So in, you know, in the teaching, generally what I say, in accumulation path, that practice

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 have such a strong confidence. They're not lingering within dark or dark, or this practice,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.880
 that practice is really so strong. Therefore, they begin to accumulate merit, you know,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.880
 virtuous activity, begin to accumulate merit. And among the merit, what accumulate? More

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.640
 accumulate merit, that you accumulate, one after another. And what emotions with that term,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.520
 removing, growth level of the emotion obscurations. Removing, cleaning, and therefore again,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.080
 inward, as I said earlier, then what growth see? More calm, more peaceful, more joy, more content,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.480
 and less, a little bit small, small bit of the anger, it's kind of less, to remove it, less anger.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.840
 I mean, this is small, say that those all know name as the, the sign of the accumulation path is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.120
 developed. Then we continue to keep the practices that now we reach to the application path.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.000
 So that means, the, now, in the application path, in the application path, now what means the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.070
 education? What is the teaching? In the debate of Jollam, Jollam means that also sometimes

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.720
 translated

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.760
 the conjunction path. So that means, accumulation path is, is level of the practice, we are

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.240
 already sentient beings. And the same path is according to Buddhism, noble, noble, noble.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.840
 When you realize that you become the noble, or path of the noble. So education path

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.280
 is beat with that. So what is applicable? You promise samsara or only the level and

00:04:49.280 --> 00:05:01.520
 applying, applying to the, the noble path. Or from the samsara level, you're conjunct,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.280
 conjunct, I believe, conjunct into the noble level. That's the world meaning. Jollam means

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.960
 public salary. It's going to lead to the noble, noble state of the same path. So now, in the same

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.760
 path, what is it? Again, the same path in the teaching divided many kind of levels. But I've said,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.200
 when you reach the middle of the swing path, now you really, that your realization of the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.320
 emptiness of true nature is not just fusion, but it's become more clay, more clay. And kind of in

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:42.160
 the teaching said, the prior of the realization is coming soon because I feel the heat of the

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.200
 heat. So it's even the name of that heat, heat. But you see that warmth and something,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.080
 not just a theory only, you really develop. Develop. At that time, inner style of the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.480
 realization or the achievement, you have more, more compassion, more loving kindness, more

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.360
 tolerance,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:12.560
 more passion, and less emotions are less than in the accumulation path. All that become, even maybe

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.600
 became, have good visions, good dreams of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Bodhisattvas, and all that,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.440
 in the teaching said. So that turns out again, you reduce. And the emotional level, again,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.080
 what is emotional? It's all, all emotion obscurations, that true obscurations,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:41.680
 emotional obscurations. And then you reach to the first Bumi. Now, first Bumi is same path,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.480
 same path as we all say, same path is same true nature, exactly as it is.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:56.560
 At that time, now we see the true nature, exactly as it is, in the emotional level, the gross level

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.800
 of the ego clinging is gone, gross level of the ego clinging, gone, particularly during the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.440
 meditation.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:14.560
 And both, better than you'd say, ego clinging is gone. And see the true nature,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.720
 exactly as it is. And your love and your compassion, the Muslims are really so strong

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.600
 and back and understand and knowledge is so strong and so good. And even in the teaching said,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.080
 that time that Bodhisattvas, whether it's male or female, can have behold thousand Buddhas,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:43.360
 thousand Buddhas, and the teachings, and also can can change things.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:55.760
 Slide. And for that time, what is now gross emotion? The karma is finishing emotion,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.120
 but still there is stain of the karma. So that means stain of the

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:10.000
 emotional obscurations, emotional obscurations. The karma, gross karma is gone.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.440
 And since karma is gone, that means the source of karma is gross, is gone.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:23.920
 That means source of the karma is the emunions, anger, yellows, hatred toward England, that's gone.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.160
 Now you reach for the second Burmese. Second Burmese is the meditation part.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.480
 And that is now, in the teaching said, what are you cleansing? What does the practice of this

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:44.240
 cleansing put in fire? Now cleansing, the still that left over emotional obscurations,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.600
 triggered with the knowledge obscurations. Now begin to walk on knowledge obscurations.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:58.080
 Knowledge obscurations is attachment or grasp. Cleaning, that is cleansing. And now you're doing

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.160
 that cleansing, cleansing, continuing dynamic of religion, understanding love, and competing with

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.920
 those are the inequalities of the primordial wisdom. So it's growing stronger and stronger,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:18.560
 and all that continues growing until the earth booming. At the Burmese, now the emotion obsc

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.040
urations,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.840
 the stain of emotions are completely gone. And the knowledge obscurations are very much reduced,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:35.280
 reduced, almost gone, also knowledge obscurations. Knowledge obscurations. And now you have to deal

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:43.840
 three Burmese, and those are known as the feuded Burmese in teaching 9th, Takpa Satsang, and 8th,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.960
 9th, and 10th Burmese. And that three Burmese, what do you clean? According to the teaching,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.760
 you clean and now stain of the knowledge obscurations. Strain of knowledge obscurations,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.600
 and then you're getting smaller and smaller, and then when you reach the 11th Burmese, or that,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.000
 at the end of that, then you complete this. The most unsettled of the knowledge obscuration

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.040
 is cleared away by the most powerful antidote of the realization known as the Vedya Samadhi,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.480
 that completely cleared with it. Then you become fully enlightened. So you have to clean all the

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.920
 karma, and according to Zuki teaching in Vedya and the teaching so far, you immediately, really,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:38.640
 those are not just a process, but you use it like, what's it called? Akman? Akman is a technist.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.760
 Akman is a technist. Akman is a technist, transforming those. And Zuki then is a self-liberated

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.840
 state. So really, he's a great director. He's nothing powerful than that, self-liberated. So

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:58.640
 all the Vedya and the technists, Akman, Akman, Akman is like the answer, but again,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.200
 you have to clean. There's no way they're not clean. You have to, in the Zuki Masterful,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.920
 therefore, but in the Toga practice, they always say that they don't, at Ahtia, they don't clean

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.920
 in those people.
