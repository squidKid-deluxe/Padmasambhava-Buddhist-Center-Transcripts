00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 This is so many years by kindness and joy, and had this great opportunity to do this practice in

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.440
 this big city, again, again, again, again.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.480
 It's the same practice, the same meditation, but again, to remind you of this practice, this is one

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.560
 of the very important and special practices that Vajrayana teaching offers.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.060
 And Vajrayana teaching has so many skillful means practices, as many of you already heard and know

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 that.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 Why Vajrayana is so important and so special? Because this teaching is more skillful means

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.120
 practices, therefore it is swept to reach the enlightenment.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.110
 That also means it is swept to remove all obscurations, obstacles, diseases, sickness, and hind

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.110
rance for enlightenment, and then it has also senses a lot of skill means it is also easy approach

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 to the enlightenment,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 without doing too many harsh ascetic practices. For those reasons, there are six or five different

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600
 specialties of Vajrayana teachings.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.160
 So, this is that Vajrayana teachings. And Vajrayana teaching has also many different sections, as

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.920
 many of you know, those are the outer and inner tantra, and so forth.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060
 This teaching is inner tantra teachings.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 Inner Tantra teaching is also divided as the Father Tantra, Mother Tantra, and Neutral Tantras, or

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.100
 Mahayoga Tantra, Anu-Yoga Tantra, or Ati-Yoga Tantra divisions.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:47.200
 This teaching is best on the Mahayoga teaching or the Father Tantra, and combined with the Anu and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 Ati teaching, all the Mother Tantra and Neutral Tantra, all combined,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 we have targeted one single stage that we can practice easily, approach, and bring forth the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.940
 relaxation.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.570
 And Vajrayana teaching is also not only looking externally, but also is looking inwardly to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.680
 discover the innate nature, and as well as externally, every day as enlightenment status.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.180
 So, this is one of those very special practices.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.010
 In Vajrayana teaching, as many skillful means practices, among that skillful means, all those skill

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.020
ful means practices, and Pāyār pūjā or the Yajā is one of the very powerful practices.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.130
 And Pāyār pūjā or the Yajā practices are best on the poor activities of the Buddhas, or the in

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.900
-life activities, or the bodhijata activities.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.850
 Those poor activities, what are generally desirable things in the samsara that what we are looking

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.090
 for, what like to be removed, the hindrance, the obstacles, those are known as the pacifying

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 practices.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:07.810
 Pacifying practices or pacifying actions, increasing actions, subjugation actions, and then magnet

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.700
izing actions.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.720
 So, those are the poor actions, and that is something that we like to remove, this is called pac

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:25.820
ifying, we like to remove, and release, and something that we desire to increase, and that's the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.180
 increasing actions, something that we like to have with us, not go away, that is the magnetizing.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.510
 Something that we like to be overpowered, or completely subdued, that is called subjugation

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.500
 practice.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.630
 So, what is this time? And as we join, these prayers is a task that is unique, we are joining every

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.820
 time, it is mentioned clearly, and we like to pacify first.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 What we like to pacify, first is all the obstacles, obstacles, and obstacles are coming because of

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.340
 obscurations, obscurations are not coming without any, what's called, cause and conditions.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.250
 Everything has a cause and everything has conditions, nothing is happening without a cause and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.710
 condition by itself. The obscurations are handedness, obscurations, that's what the Buddha said,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:36.100
 cause of sufferings, the cause of suffering, that we like to be removed, triggered with suffering

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.860
 itself, that we like to be removed.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.870
 So, cause of suffering, the obscurations, that is the Vadhyana teaching, a general in the Buddha's

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.980
 teaching, terminology used as obscurations, that we like to be removed.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.900
 And what are obscurations? Obscurations is to simply explain, is the ignorance, the dullness mind,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.720
 the ignorance, blockage, unknowing, unseen, can't figure out exactly, dilemmas, we can't see any

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.900
 further than the right in front of us.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.650
 Relistantly talking, we can't see any, even in front, we just look only to our direction, whatever

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.200
 that we see, and we can't see anything surrounding. That is called ignorance. Ignorance, we don't

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.940
 see name.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.310
 Because of that dullness, then we created so many other activities, that thinking is good for us,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:35.570
 we created attachment activities, anger activities, jealous activities, arrogant activities, always

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.940
 thinking there is something good for us.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:46.960
 But yet, it is undermining, is removing our joy, peace, carrying away, peace by peace, peace by

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.940
 peace.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.000
 That obscuration, we like to be removed, we like to pacify it. And when we remove that, what is

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.940
 bring back? The wisdom, opposite of the ignorance is the wisdom, awareness, understanding.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.840
 Let's shine the wisdom through us, us, so that we can see clearly our directions, even we don't see

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.940
 everywhere, but at least our destination, our direction, our purpose, our journey.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:30.280
 Seeing that, bring up that realization is called wisdom understand, bring the wisdom. When we have

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.550
 the wisdom activities, then naturally all those activities of the anger, activities of the

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.940
 attachment, activities of the jealous and the hated,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:38.360
 and arrogance goes away. Because we won't do something that unhealthy things, when we know clearly

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.940
 it is, and our understanding.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.940
 So therefore, what we pacify, we pacify all those obscurations.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:53.360
 In the Buddha's yandere terminology as used, the cause of suffering, that is what we glorify, that

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.940
 must be removed. And then, together with it, suffering itself.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:08.670
 Suffering, sadness, difficulties, obstacles, hindrance, unwilling, kind of wicked things, whatever

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:14.940
 we have, those were removed, whatever that, so that is pacify.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:23.790
 And then increasing, one way increasing, increasing of the joy, peace, happiness, and then real

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.940
izations, understandings.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.760
 And this is again, not just focused ourselves, since we are Varyana practitioners, that means we

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.940
 are like super-duper Mahayana practitioners.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.750
 That's truly bigger. It's not just Sutra Mahayana practicing, Varyana means the whole sum, whole

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.940
 practice of Varyana teaching.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.940
 So therefore, we really wish this to all the sentient beings, sincerely from our bottom of heart,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.940
 with joy, peace, happiness.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:08:00.460
 Not just surviving joy, peace, happiness, but we intensify, increase the joy and peace. That's

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:07.910
 called increasing prosperity, joy, peace, happiness, realizations, understandings, respect and

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.940
 appreciation.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.480
 Versus them shine through their mind and not block them. Buddha nature is what everyone has in the

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.940
 Buddha's teaching.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.580
 But however the ignorance is blocking, that let's remove that ignorance, dullness, so it shines,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.940
 grows, peace, happiness to everyone.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.940
 Not just only now, but forever, really we can sense it from our heart.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.600
 This is very powerful practice with Varyasat, so the bodhijata practice, thinking of all the beings

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.940
.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.940
 When we practice this, truly we are making very difference, right in our heart.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:51.940
 That will reflect to our family, friends and neighbors and countries, and then goes on and on.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:58.940
 As ripple effort, ripple effort, unending shines that power goes to everywhere.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:06.940
 This is so special practice, so increasing activity. That is what this mainly practice is.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.590
 Passifying, increasing is again so special, so significant to do this practice at the beginning of

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.940
 the new years.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.940
 Begin the new year with these practices.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.940
 And of course every country has different new years, almost every country has different new years,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.940
 this and that new years.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.940
 But this new year is one of the biggest new years in the world, everywhere this is.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.940
 And this is again, therefore, I mean, whatever the consumption make that, this is true.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.940
 It happened on a illegal level. So this is the biggest new years.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:48.940
 And this biggest new years, we are making something, big practices, very beautiful practices for

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.940
 ourselves, for all the beings.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.940
 So therefore again, great joy and apprehensions.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.940
 This is one of the beautiful moments, beautiful time, beautiful things to do.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:06.630
 And how lucky, how beautiful that I had the opportunity to practice at Togedai, with Sangameva get

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.940
 Togedai.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.940
 One intention, one thought, one goal, one mental.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:17.880
 And within that frame, we are intensifying our inner bodhicitta, the bodhic, the love and kindness

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.940
 as fire comes.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.940
 So that is really about this practice of Vaija Sattva.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:30.250
 And then of course, when we practice the Vaija Sattva, as we read this already, we practice this in

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:30.940
 India.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.940
 We visualize ourselves as Vaija Sattva, man, female.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.460
 That means not just the only kind of small location of Vaija Sattva that we practice, entirely

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.940
 universal.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.940
 Whole phenomena system is transformed, it is already in that state, not transformed.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.940
 It's just that we bring up that nature without block it by the dualities.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.940
 That's what in the beginning time, we join this prayer in here, Sanskrit, what is it?

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.940
 Om Mahay, Shuneta, Jnanam, Vender, Sobhama, Atmaku, Hung.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.940
 That is what the practice is.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.940
 It's beyond the duality, beyond the ego traits.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.940
 It's a natural state of the salt-borne awareness, wisdom status.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.940
 That is what it is, nature.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.940
 So, go back to our origin and natural status.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.940
 From there, then here, in the teachings, this is one of the great teachings of the Vaija Sattva

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:34.940
 by Gaurabhayama Sambhava and revered by famous Tehtung, Rinzi, Jumi, Dordi, or Tehrdalumba.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.940
 It's teaching all the words of Gaurabhayama Sambhava.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.940
 All, Purnama, Samsara, Nirvana, organly, unbound, emptiness from which.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:49.940
 That means everything is beyond the duality, no grasping, no clinking.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.340
 From that, everything appeared in the beautiful and then we became ourselves as Vaija Sattva, we

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:56.940
 see.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.940
 Vaija Sattva is an accidental, versatile body.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.940
 That is what we visualize.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.940
 So, all phenomena is within that mental status, we join this.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.940
 So, that means our body or every poem are the Vaija Sattva.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.940
 Every sound system of the Vaija Sattva, sound or sound, the wisdom of the blissfulness,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:20.940
 every thought or the emptiness is the wisdom mind of the Vaija Sattva.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.940
 And male and female, completely United States.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.940
 With that visualization, now we're going to visualize, right in front of, in the fire,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.940
 we visualize that same nendala, same thing, like as in self reflected image of the Vaija Sattva.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.940
 In the fire, that is what we're going to visualize.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:46.940
 So, now to do that, again there's some more praise ceremonies that I have to do and I will do,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:53.940
 but then we all, when I begin to decide this praise, that moment or when the fire is begin to light

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:53.940
,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.940
 that moment, this fire is becoming the nendala of the Vaija Sattva.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:06.940
 First is, also there's two stages and first is, the fire is just a regular fire in a way.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.940
 Regular fire only and that will, that, and then instead the fire transform the wisdom fire

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:20.940
 and within that, Vaija Sattva, male and female and again, just exactly self, self, what's called

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.940
 the same image,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.940
 self reflected image that as what we visualize as a rainbow body and then we will visualize

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:35.940
 and make all these offerings and we can everything forward as we go this praise.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.940
 So, that is the brief kind of reminding of these practices and now it's really the beginning.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:48.940
 So, to begin this, again, as I said, I will do, so other, this more kind of like formal practice,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:14:07.940
 about the detail one and then we come forward with the detail.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.440
