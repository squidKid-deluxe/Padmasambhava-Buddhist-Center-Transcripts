00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 With the strengthening of our motivation of the Bodhicata, taking on all living beings,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 and with that contrast, then we again had the great opportunity to follow the teaching of

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.520
 Nghurapayama Sambha, vertically practicing on Nghurapayama Sambha, being in his versions,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.600
 and as well as in the lala of his entire assembly. We tried to follow step by step

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.880
 with the great instructions, and with the instructions that we received, and it's one

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.280
 of the great opportunities and great times that we all had together. And with that, beautiful

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.000
 memories

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.720
 and beautiful time, and as well also set beautiful legacy and kind of plans for the future,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.600
 and to benefit, to activate that practice in our heart and mind, and then benefit for others,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 kind of having those spiritual motivations taught, trying to kind of sizzling in the heart and mind

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.920
,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.160
 and then again we follow with this instruction.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:52.080
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:23.120
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:35.040
 The essential fuel to practice and continue to bring the growth is devotion and joyful effort

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.360
 and both each other. This we all need. This devotion and both each other's joyful effort

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.360
 is like, again, is like fuel. It's like, it's vitality. It is central column. It is foundation

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.720
 to do practices. Without this strong and firm and continually renewing that every time,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.240
 our practice and our meditation, our beautiful goal not always goes smooth. It almost sometimes

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.920
 started with excitement and enthusiasm, but then it's fading away, fading away,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.960
 lose the state. And what happened many times, kind of feel that we're depressed, all kind of lost

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.520
 it,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.200
 all that happened because lack of the devotion, joyful effort, and both each other. Therefore,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.520
 as we all have this beautiful motivation of devotion, both each other, joyful effort,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 that's what you all gathered here, we all here, and continually to inspire that with practice,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 meditation, with the teachings, with that inspired, continually one after another. And

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.560
 every day, then our practice really always glowing, shining, beautiful, and moving forward,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 then we will be reverted by our effort. And our practices, we will be joy from the joy to the joy.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.560
 Happy to the happy, and then reach the final goal of the enlightenment. So therefore, we should

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.800
 always kind of, this is the basic things. Devotion and both each other and joyful effort looks like

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.800
,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.880
 but it is the really central column, fuel and foundation, and we always remember that to each

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 of us and to continue more, and we like to bring the result and the growth of what we set for this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.520
 journey.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:53.120
 We all have that. We all have that. That's why we gathered here. Therefore, recognizing that

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.480
 goal and glorifying and honoring, rejoicing of that and inspiring, and then continuing more,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.800
 this is generally known as the being practitioner, being good practitioners.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.320
 That's why we read in the Gurdw as teaching in this book, or which you read repeatedly,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.400
 one after another. He made it so many times that again and again. This is always touch to the basic

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.800
 foundation. Again, even though he has highest realization, he is a Buddha, but yet he's teaching,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.360
 always touch back to the foundation, basic things. That's what really we have to grow

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.040
 and deepen our practice and then fulfill our goals.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:56.640
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.840
 And this is, again, the Buddha Shakyamuni said, again, of course,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.960
 Buddha taught that it is the following teaching of the Buddha. Always Buddha taught that, and we

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.160
 follow that teaching. One after another, it's devotion and joy and confidence, what we talk.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.480
 It's Buddha taught, reflected throughout the teachings. Even Buddha said, whoever remembering

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.560
 Buddha with full confidence and feel the presence of the Buddha, Buddha, right? If whoever feels

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.640
 the

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.680
 presence of Buddha, the Buddha will sit right in front of them and will bless continually and

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.520
 inspire support. This is the way to enter a blessing to our heart, mind. Blessing is,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.960
 is have to come, but we have to open ourself. This is generally every spiritual group says,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.200
 it's true. With all this, there's no aspirations, no joy. As we said, they did lead. I mean,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.000
 we can't really sometimes disappointment all that comes because lack of the devotion, joy of effort

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.440
 and then both each other. Who will be the loser? Finally, the individual will be then

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:25.600
 kind of almost victim of our own self.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:54.480
 We have this beautiful devotion, this foundation, then realization just blooms. It's just like

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.440
 spring.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.840
 It's just like life. Effort comes so beautifully, so wonderfully. All that just has different

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.720
 meaning, but it unfolds with the growth, the discovery. It comes one after another, and then

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.440
 we bring the realization of the great zocchi, reaching beautiful goal and for all the beautiful

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.760
 things in these lives. And that's what known as good practice is. We order to do that again. I mean

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:21.760
,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.800
 we talk about the devotion and both each other, and then we're going to put devotion as we said,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.560
 to this, to the Gaurabhama sambhava. Gaurabhama sambhava, import him into all Buddha, Dharma,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.200
 Sangha, Guru, Deva, Dakini, and Dharmapala. If we can't visualize all of these things,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.160
 we're going to bring one simple state as to Gaurabhama sambhava, who is the important member

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.600
 of all the Buddhas. And for that reason, in many teachings said, the body of Gaurabhama sambhava

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.560
 represents all the Sangha members. And the speech of Gaurabhama sambhava represents all the

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.040
 teachings

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.680
 of the Buddhas, all the teachings. And the Western mind represents the entire Buddhas of the 10

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.570
 directions, three times, everything. So one single state, we see as Gaurabhama sambhava, and it

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:10.800
 feels

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:18.160
 strong connection and devotion, and then practice. And then, that's the simple way to connect it to

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.520
 entirely the universe of the Buddha Mendalas and Mendalas of the three Gayas or three Jus.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.800
 - Thank you, Jared, and I'll answer.
