00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 "Realizations. In some teachings, the students become better than even teachers, and their grant

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 students become even better than their teacher and grant teachers.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 So the continual lineage is really great. Lineage is nothing but loving kindness and compassion,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 wisdom, and respect and appreciation to all beings exploring our beauty in a college of Buddha

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.000
 nature that we inherited.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.490
 And glorify, shine that really will be accorded their capabilities and the readiness of others.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.000
 That's what they did.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.200
 And today we are remembering our great lead teacher, Kinti Pati Sherab Rinpoche, who attended Mah

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.000
aparinirvana about 11 years.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 Today, we will create this short praise here, and then we are going to insert some other praise. I

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 will tell you how we do this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.580
 However, we are really remembering his kindness, his wisdom in the congregation, his old

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.000
 instruction that he taught us.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.890
 More than that, he stands for the Dharma, himself being a practitioner. Dharma is truly what he

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.000
 said. He kept that teaching to his heart.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.590
 It's not just something that he says something and doing something else. But he kept truly the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 teaching in heart and showed the example, Tori.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.250
 A legacy, beautiful example to all of us. So today, we are remembering this great, beautiful

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.000
 teacher yet so humble and so simple, don't hurt, care you.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.870
 We all played with him. We walked with him. We did many and so many good things. Good things and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.000
 ordinary things, mundane things, we really moved.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.770
 But yet, all blending perfectly, beautifully into the Dharma. Peaceful, loving kindness, compassion

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.000
, non-attachment in a way, grasping, that's really what he showed us.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 So we again, remember this and do this praise. Thank you, everyone.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I think there's a couple of different versions. Is this calling the Rama from Lamshepa?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 No, this is Lamshepa. Yeah, this is Lamshepa. So Kune-la Rama from Lamshepa, I mean, it's not that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 that's Lamshepa.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 So another version, that's page five.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.130
 Another version, that's page five. Another version here, Mike. I have this version, page 39. So

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.000
 either one you choose, okay?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I mean, whatever you have. Thank you, everyone.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 By your kindness, very blissfulness is distantly gone.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Lamsan, you of your life produce tool. I bow down to the loaded speed of the Dharma.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Lamsan, you are the Buddha. Lamsan, you are the Dharma. Lamsan, you are the Sangha.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 In fact, Lamsan, you are the master of everything.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 I bow down to the divine body's speed to an omnipotence, neglected by all the Buddhas.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 I am dead toward the abyss of the lower realms. You can muster us to the path of liberation.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.130
 Great Captain, I bow down to you. Not knowing what is right and wrong, I wander aimlessly on

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.000
 mistaken paths, with the gloom becoming ever higher.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 I praise you for the light of my vision. Seeing your body changes perceptions.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 By the power of a fraction of the remains of your bodies, the worst negativity is purified.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 This is so endless. I bow down to you to benefit whoever you encounter.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.100
 By hearing you, I learn when it's right and wrong, and am protected from the great bliss of bad

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.000
 content.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 The nature of your teaching is the truth of the path and cessation.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 I praise the great melodious voice of you who liberates upon hearing.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Even if I put forth great effort, realization won't come.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 By the power of your concentration, I am instantly matured.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 It is when I develop the ocean that my realization will shine.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I bow down to the inconceivable power of the absolute truth.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.120
 Even by going through hardships or three countless eons, and enduring torture of all the senses, it

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.000
 is difficult to attain the state of the body suffer.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I bow down to the one who shows directly the unmistakable result.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Long among you are the precious Buddha. I have no other hope than you.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Please look at me with your eyes of compassion and liberate me from the ocean of samsara.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 In this life, may everything be accomplished perfectly, without invincibles or obstacles.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And at the moment of my death, can I recognizeingly the alike luminosity?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Please liberate me from the difficult passage to the art of.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 May all the activities of my body, prestige, and mind always benefit others.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Whatever circumstances arise, may they become the path to enlightenment.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Please transform them right now.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Is it difficult to cross with my effort? I will protect it by the bow of your compassion.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Let powerless beings such as me and all others reach the land of nirvana.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Whoever likes me, or whoever criticizes or argues with me, may all their aspirations be exhausted.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 May everything emotions release, and may they be freed from the rivers of cyclic existence.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Finally, even by hearing my name, may all wishes of beings be fulfilled.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 In all pure lands and defined directions, may clouds of inexhaustible abundant offerings rain down.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.510
 By the power of this merit, may all beings be absolutely freed from samsara, gain the two supreme w

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.000
isdoms,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 and spontaneously fulfill the two beneficial activities.
