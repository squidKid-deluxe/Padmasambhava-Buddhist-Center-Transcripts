 Longchenpa Rinpoche, in order to resolve all doubts and questions.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.400
 like the table preparing those all is past pattern of us.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.720
 And that you prepare those beautifully nice arrangement,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.760
 all the food and offerings, everything, display so beautifully,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.200
 nicely, it looks so beautiful, so uplifting, calm and peaceful,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.160
 soothing, it's beautiful.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.680
 And then [INAUDIBLE] all the good foods, good food, fruit,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 fruit, and cookies, and those are like the yummies you bring up,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.760
 all these things such as a nice ice cream too, but not too much,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.680
 right, we don't want to do that.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.120
 And all those yummy, nice things really display so beautifully,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.320
 nice and shrines and everything, nice,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.680
 that is about the picking of novels, trying novels.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.720
 And then practicing individualism also should be novel too,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.480
 perhaps more jewel, more epicure, more love,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.160
 more kindness filled in heart, and more respect,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.880
 more polite to the sangha print to each other.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.520
 This is the gathering of the sangha members.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.640
 That means various brothers and sisters are gathering.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.200
 And in the Buddha teaching said, this is not just

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.160
 we are going to be toghede, we are going to be toghede

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
 until we become the enlightenment.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.320
 As how, in the always-invading and teaching [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.240
 we will be going to glorify the light of love and compassion

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.880
 as weak of the bottom line, weak, weak, right, weak,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.280
 weak of bottom line, as weak of bottom line burning.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.120
 Burning light in the bottom line is not just

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.040
 burning by the wood alone.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.160
 In Tibet, I mean, they use wood inside the wood.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.540
 It's not just about the cotton alone.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.920
 It's not just about the oil alone.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.600
 It's not just about the land port alone.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.680
 It has a lot of combination.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.880
 Similarly, the glory and light of love and compassion,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.240
 what's the-- we're going to glorify as sangha members

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.400
 toghede, toghede, harmonized beautifully.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.920
 Therefore, it is a precious gathering, precious moment,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.520
 precious learning.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.320
 Therefore, very calm, heart is filled with joy and devotion,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.360
 respect and appreciation.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.680
 Entire each other, medallat, everything.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.160
 That is the gathering.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.720
 That is the gathering of the feast.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.960
 And then voice is also so beautiful, calm, peaceful,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.240
 respect, politeness, well-spotted each other.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.200
 That is noble, noble.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.600
 And then body is also noble.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.160
 We should dress up nicely, beautiful, calm hands.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.180
 Watch, beautiful, dress up nice.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.840
 It's not something that we have to make complete.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.360
 All the ends are gathered here.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 We gather in beautiful beings, beautiful, nice manner.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.200
 Manner means we all know.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.760
 We all know. Manner means not talking about heart,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.560
 where you appear, where you are standing, where you're speaking.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.200
 Those are in a samsara called manners.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.720
 Nice, soft speaking, and nice dress, nice clothes, nice.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.320
 It's not something that we have to put faces,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.640
 expensive clothes, but whatever we have something nice, clean,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.560
 neat, decent, and that is what we do.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.800
 If we do that, what is that?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.920
 That is honoring to the lineage, honoring to the buddhas,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.000
 honoring to the mandalas, and finally we are honored

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.480
 to our own body.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.080
 Our own body is in Vaidya and the Tijibana.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.320
 It's five dying buddhas.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.600
 And when you read the dress here, this, when you read this,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.160
 this standard skin, what is?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.200
 Pungo sanyana, the dead body.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:27.400
 And with this respect to our body, we are breaking the vowels.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.560
 We are breaking vowels of the, I think, head vowels.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.600
 You read, okay, Pungo sanyana, is there air?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.120
 >> Twenty-six, the eighth.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.800
 >> And is air, right, head vowels?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.200
 Head vowels in the 14th.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.480
 >> It's in the 14th.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.000
 >> No, no, the vow, Pungo sanyana, head vowels, right?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.800
 Pungo sanyana, head vowels, dead body.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.400
 Give up our products.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.760
 We kind of ignore our body, ourself in kind of disregard that.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.400
 That is really known as breaking the rules of the Vaidya and the Tijis.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.600
 That means we are respected, appropriate to our body,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.120
 taking care of ourself, dressed on the ice

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.400
 and the beautiful things and kind of nice.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.320
 I mean, it's not something that expensive and all those things.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320
 Can't we have to be, but even we have kind of nice, clean, neat looking

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.040
 and gather and then wear nice robes, such as whatever.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.560
 Kind of clean, neat looking.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.800
 That is known as honoring to the lineage, honor to, as I said,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.640
 and then deep down honor to the ourself, respect.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.320
 And that is then, it's Pungo sany, the pipe aggregate

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.400
 of our body is the pipe Diana Buddha.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.960
 And we blame and criticize not honor with breath in the Vaidya and vowels.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.280
 That's what the Tijis say.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.600
 So therefore, kind of dress up nice and beautifully and all that is

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.000
 so important, so beautiful, so special.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.880
 It's nice, it's nice.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.440
 It makes kind of looks beautiful, calm and peaceful.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.480
 In that way, in for example, unless you have big yogi and yogis,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.320
 then they do it sometimes different.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.600
 But even for example, there's nothing higher

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.920
 and bigger yogi than Gurbel Masambha.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.200
 Gurbel Masambha.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.280
 Of course, personally, I didn't see or we didn't see,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.280
 but look to Gurbel Masambha.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.920
 Here, this is supposed to be Gurbel Masambha.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.320
 How he dress up?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.680
 Look, I'm not saying we should get all these costumes.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.840
 Look at this.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.640
 I'm not kidding.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.760
 And there's nothing higher and bigger yogi

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.760
 and the realization of the veins than the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.800
 Look to this Buddha.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.680
 How he dress up?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.160
 Look, and it's simple.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.040
 It's simple, very simple.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.160
 Ladies, I mean, you need face.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.800
 It's not expensive, any cloth the Buddha has to wear.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.640
 But look at this.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:09.800
 This is the illustrations of the pronged 2000.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.480
 What's called?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.760
 2600, yes, and it's continued now.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.800
 This is what's so simple, so beautiful, so nice, nice, clean,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.520
 very, it's also very, what's called, like yuppie.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.600
 Yuppie.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.840
 It's like what's called in the word.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.000
 It's a gap, gap.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.840
 It's like khaki.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.840
 It's khaki style.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.200
 Look at this, how simple.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.600
 That is that one.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.760
 Nice, those all are the first part of nobles.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.600
 It's nice.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.040
 And this way, for example, when we went to shop,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.840
 when we went to this, this, this, for example,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.040
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.320
 where this is nicely.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.960
 And so small part of this goes over here.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.320
 And then, longer part of this, when we're walking,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:14.320
 we fold it up and put on your wrist.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.600
 When you sit down, you will put this in a little bit.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 They put this in the monaster.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.720
 They put it around your knees.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.040
 When you sit there, you cover your whole, your knees.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.160
 And when you are in the shrine room,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.280
 unless you're walking in a way of monasteries,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.800
 unless you're walking, doing something,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.240
 otherwise, you always put that on the here, here,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.360
 not on your shoulder.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.200
 If you put that in the shoulder, it's

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.200
 a little bit more, a little bit wild.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.760
 Wild, if you put that.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.040
 And you put this on here and this, this.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.000
 And that's what is new.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.480
 Rufushek, is there a symbolism?

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.960
 I know.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:08.800
 So John was telling us that on the right side would be,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.120
 our arm would be there, and our left arm would be covered.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.080
 Is there symbolism within that?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.960
 By the way, I don't know if there's symbolism within that.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.200
 This is in monasteries, generally, in ancient times.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.320
 And for example, like vodas, like this.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.320
 This is the-- they really did it very once,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.720
 kind of like those great aratas.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.440
 They wear some short.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.200
 So they always keep this.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.800
 Usually, in the ancient times, I don't know if they really wear it,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.640
 unless you're a nun.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.880
 You're a nun, then they wear something here.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.160
 They keep that.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.520
 But if you're not-- for all those monks,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.640
 ancient time, they don't have much things to wear here.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.280
 So they only show that that's what they wear there.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.720
 And so the others keep that-- they kind of keep this open.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.720
 And there's nothing really I saw that has symbols there.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.560
 But it is just tradition.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:17.040
 Traditionally, that's how them maintain, or that's how I saw.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040
 So, OK.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:26.120
 And so now, with the cloth, the nice cloth and all that,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.760
 and sit down with beautiful atmosphere,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.320
 and beautiful with that, those are all known

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.720
 as beginning of the novels.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.760
 Beginning past, past part of novels.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.520
 Then again, not beginning novel has ended.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.520
 When you sit down, sit down, and then with beautiful intention.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.120
 And that's always the practice, beautiful intention.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.440
 Bring joy and appreciation, love and kindness and compassion,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.320
 and target with strong devotions.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.080
 Devotion is so, again, important.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.400
 To bring up the lineage blessings,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.880
 to bring up-- to discover our inner quality, natural measures.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.640
 Devotion is so, so important.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.400
 And devotion is joy.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.120
 Devotion is respect.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.120
 Devotion is appreciation.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.720
 And devotion is confidence and trust.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.280
 All that is said.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.760
 With that, too, and then giant such as praise.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.560
 Praise.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.680
 And that also means, here, we're going

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.320
 to discover three regular states.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.360
 Ceremony goes on.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.080
 Gara jaka ceremony is really me.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.320
 We're glorifying our realization.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.600
 Restart any of our realization practices.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.120
 And shining up, polishing our practices.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.000
 Practice.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.640
 That means trying to clean away all those stains

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.520
 and obscurations.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.280
 Whatever that is disturbing, now we're

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.160
 going to clean, purify that.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.280
 And so that is what it is.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.200
 And with those beautiful thoughts,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.080
 strong presence of the-- at the beginning,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.280
 strong presence of lineage.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.480
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.800
 And all in light, right in front of your skies.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.000
 And then giant prayers.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.680
 Giant, these seven-line prayers as we do lineage prayers.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.920
 And then, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.800
 developed in both each other.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.800
 And the four according.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.120
 Again, it is shower blessings.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.160
 If we go now, look to the shower blessings.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.080
 Here, look at the text.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:40.000
 Then continue all this lineage prayers, shower blessings,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.760
 says it continually until page seven.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.120
 This all is known as the post novels.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.040
 From start to preparing of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.440
 and shrine.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.560
 And your son will prepare a nice [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.200
 some nice cloth, a nice kind of like that.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.520
 And all from that, everything is known as--

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.440
 everything is known as the first novels.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.560
 Everything with beautiful intention taught.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.800
 And then, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.520
 and all that you know, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.600
 all those meanings that I have to keep.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.040
 So I won't go all those ways.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.400
 So that is all the first novel.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.720
 Now, the foundation is perfect.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.160
 Foundation is so beautiful.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.040
 The first is post is state.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.400
 It's excellent.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.560
 Now, we're going to take the second novels.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.160
 Second novel in this case, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.640
 blessings from page eight, all the way

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.480
 those [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ceremonies.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.660
 All the way, and then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.080
 all those are second prayers.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080
 And the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.360
 practice, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.880
 and then all the way to what every of the practices

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.320
 is all the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.880
 blessings, blessings until page 49.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.040
 Until page 49 is the second novel.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.080
 From page 8, page--

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.160
 until page 49 is second novels.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:31.160
 Second novels.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.560
 At this time, now, you discover the truly three--

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.600
 what we're talking--

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.760
 three-weather status.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.640
 Truly discover and truly revel in that nature.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.480
 Three-weather status without grasping, without clinging,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.120
 without discriminating, without hesitation, doubt,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.840
 and skeptical snow.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.200
 Those are varnish.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:06.040
 Those are liberated in the state of the absolute dharma-dhaka.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.280
 Nature.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:14.280
 And from there, all the way to the page 49

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.640
 is then the second novel.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.360
 And the second novel, Oakland, was in changing cities.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.560
 Second novel, no grasping, no clinging.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.880
 That means everything is here is displayed, magic.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.440
 Magic of the wisdom, magic of compassion.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.680
 Or the dream of wisdom, dream of compassion.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.520
 Dream of display, everything.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.800
 Song, whether the song is magic, whether the poem is magic,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.280
 whether mind is magic.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.640
 And all are never separate from each other.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.560
 These three are never separate from each other.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.640
 All that.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.560
 With that, and with that, reflecting externally,

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:13.080
 heart, love, kind, compassion, respect, and appreciation.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.240
 Let it come.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.360
 Let it go.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.680
 Let it be.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.320
 And all those practice teachings,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.360
 instructed by the great masters, and with that,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.240
 is all that is three-way, among the three-way,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.400
 and among these three novel ones, this is second novel.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.200
 All that is second novel.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.120
 So now the beautiful, perfectly state

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.920
 started with the beautiful novel.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.960
 And second novel is perfectly beautiful.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.480
 And then once you've completed that, that, or when you're there,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.920
 and then third novel comes.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.520
 Third novel comes again, touching back to where we started,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.880
 in a way.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.080
 Touch back wherever, how we started.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.000
 And we started with the joy, love, respect, and appreciation,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.080
 both each other, and all that.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.920
 And with that man, with that flavor,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.400
 that same gauntlet, then we're going to now start.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.920
 We're going to conclude it.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.800
 That means we're going to conclude it.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.000
 How we're going to complete it?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.320
 We're going to finish touch, final touch.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.120
 And that is then again.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.320
 And then this place, all that.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:33.000
 From here, bed 52, according to this, bed 54,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.840
 and then all our dedication place.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:42.280
 All those finishing touch, final, novel touch, novel touch.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.640
 And with again, same way, with joy and appreciation, I said.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.280
 I mean, you know that.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.280
 So that is known as, then when we've completed, completely,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.480
 everything is within a three novel status.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.080
 That is what it is, and that is what it is.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.360
 Then this practice becomes so beautiful, so perfect.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.040
 Start with it beautifully, practice it beautifully,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.040
 and concolated, and finishing it beautifully.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.280
 With that feeling, with that realization,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.160
 go in the world, engaging in the world's activities.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.760
 Again, with that same way, with joy, with respect,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.720
 with appreciation, let it come, let it go, be practical,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.800
 be common sense, be common sense, practical, capable.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.880
 Then our duty and responsibility,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.360
 exactly as we could take care of ourselves,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.520
 take care of our responsibilities, and move forward.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.040
 Joy, happy, appreciation, learning, growing, deepening.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.760
 And that's what really what the teachers,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.080
 I mean, both I and Grandma and Grandma said.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.720
 Then I said, and do every good things about what we can do.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.680
 And again, always joy and respect.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.880
 So those are what generally the ceremony itself

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.360
 to do practice like, quickly.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.080
 So that is really the whole frame of this practice.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.120
 Practice it, then with the shower blessings, and so that's it.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.560
 And if you have some questions, we'll discuss shortly.
