00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 This is also the first lesson of Dzogchen teaching as following the other great masters and

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.000
 scholars.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 First of all, Dzogci teaching. I think I mentioned it so many times, but first is the most

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.000
 important to recognize one's own energy and nature.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.550
 That's the Garab Doge teaching, three world teachings. Recognize one's energy and nature of the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 mind.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 That is so, first so important to recognize or discover or identify one's own energy and nature.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 One's energy and nature is not something different we go looking.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Looking of one's own energy and nature is our own mind, nature of one's own mind.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.960
 First, discover our own energy and nature of the mind or first identify our own energy and nature

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 of the mind.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Or seeing our own natural mind. Those are the vocabulary or the terminology I'm using.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.470
 No matter whatever I use, try to discover, see one's own natural mind. So that is what really

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.000
 nature of the mind.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.370
 How that nature of the mind is, I'm sure you read many books, you heard so many times, I also

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.000
 mentioned many times.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.910
 To the mind, to this mind, mind. Other day I also mentioned to you, look to your mind or we have to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.000
 talk something, look to your mind.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 So this is not something crazy and something colorful and something my heart share to that. It's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.000
 simple, looking to our mind.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Look to your mind. In the teaching I also said, look to the lookers.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 When you look to the lookers, all the time we look outside.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And also in the teaching I said, look to your mind, we're trying to look somewhere else.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I'm thinking to something. Because our happiness is so strong, we like to look something else.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.830
 And also sometimes when we say, look to your mind, maybe we think, what he is talking about, what

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.000
 would I say, look to your mind.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Mind. We are really kind of like had those thoughts. But this time, say, look to your mind.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 And what the grand master said, there's hundreds of things to see, but someone who saw your one's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.000
 own mind is hero.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Hero is. Hero in heroics. Who sees one's own mind is the warriors. Warriors.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 So this is the first of all, you have to know that, see that.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Find out. And what then teaching said?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Also, Sarai said, I said that quotation quite a few times.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Great Master Sarai. Sarai is one of the great masters, great enlightened beings, masters of India.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Always everyone said that. He was. And he said, noble son and noble daughter, look to your mind.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So I mean, you are going to look to your mind.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 When you look to your mind in that same teaching, there's nothing existing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 That means you're not going to see anything existing things.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And this is not existing. Then he continued. This unexistly mind, mind created so many things.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 This mind created so many things. Why did that so many things?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.170
 Good, bad, yes, no, existent, non existent, this and that. All that created by this no mind exist

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.000
ent.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 When you look to this mind, it is unbound. There's nothing you see.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 That itself is saying in the Buddha teaching, it's Dharmakaya, unbound.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 This is again what the Tara said. When you look to that, this is not his story,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 not the making story of the other side of the mountains. It's really looking to our own mind.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 To find out that, when you discover that, you see the true nature exactly as it is.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.100
 This is also another teaching by very famous, I mean, many of you know, you heard, and I heard too,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.000
 and we all heard that.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Very famous teacher known Atisha. Atisha came around 11 centuries.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 He was a great, great, great, great, great son of the Shandarakshis' family.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Great master Shandarakshis who came to Tibet, 8th century, become the founder of the great Buddha,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 founder of the Buddhism.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.860
 He is like, I mean, he was a mom, he was an old man, but his brother must continue that in the

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.000
 later generation, 11th century, around 10th century, Atisha was born.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And Atisha came to Tibet around 11th century, you know, better days.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 This is a very famous history. And he has so many students.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Among the one of the foremost disciples of Atisha is called Drongtongma.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Drongtongma is an attendant and disciple and the principal lineage holder of Atisha in Tibet.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:33.150
 Tibet, Tibet, Tibet. And in his teaching, this teaching, that Atisha and Drongtongma, they have a

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.000
 dialogue about the nature of the mind, the nature of the mind.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:56.660
 And then, Atisha, Drongtongma said to Atisha, the teacher or the Lord, I looked, I'm making a

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.000
 little commentary too.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.680
 And the teacher, I looked many times, but I did not see anything. That's what Drongtongma said to

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.000
 Atisha.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:23.780
 And Atisha said, Drongtongma, he called Drongtongma, you saw that exactly as it is, exactly as it

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.000
 is, again and again.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:36.330
 And what Drongtongma said, of course, what he asked, I did not see, I looked again and again, again

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.000
 and again, I did not see anything.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.950
 And Drongtongma, Atisha said, and Drongtongma, you looked, you saw that exactly as it is, again and

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.000
 again, exactly as it is, again and again.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:09.130
 Then, Drongtongma, he said to Atisha, Lord or great teacher, then I should just rest in that, that

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:20.090
 not finding state, not finding, I should rest in that, not seeing any, not, I should rest unseen

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.000
 state.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:41.710
 And then Atisha answered, I said, and Drongtongma, rest, rest, rest, relax in that state, rest in

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:47.000
 the relaxed in that state.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 That tells, when you look to the old nature of the mind, there's nothing to carnival see.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 When we don't see the carnival state, there's nothing further to look than that.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 That is absolute nature.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.210
 So one this in the teaching said, in the Dokti teaching, the great Master said, first to recognize

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:19.000
 that in it is natural, exactly as it is, you identify, that is so important.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And that is what it's called, in the generally called the vu.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Now you discover the vu. V-E-I, that is the vu.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Now you have to maintain, that is meditation.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Maintain is then continue meditating with good postures.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.200
 Post with good postures, with good, those all beautiful motivations, joy, appreciation and dev

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.000
otions.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.610
 And the modic that really all those instructions, you receive so many teachings, you know, and with

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.000
 that, and then after that, then relax.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Realize exactly as Atisha said, relax and calmly, peacefully, and not any effort, not any activity,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 not con forceful, relaxed.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 With that, relax, but during that time, what apply?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 The liberated techniques, applying the conduct, liberating conduct.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.280
 But that means, during the meditation, whatever the consumption of thought, the arising, instantly

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.000
 liberated.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 That means, don't hold that.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Don't go after those thoughts, liberated techniques.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 So that means that you have the vu of the unborn true nature.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Behold exactly as it is, unborn nature.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.460
 And then you maintain that really, with that instruction, you receive the teachings, or in unm

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:14.000
ovable kind of those, monkey-like, ocean-like, and as well as it is.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.860
 Those poor, abiding techniques, I think many of you know that, but basically, to relaxing natural

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.000
 state as it is.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And during the meditation, conduct is liberating.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 And all thought and consumption during the meditation will come up, that don't hold, don't analyze,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 and let it go.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Let immediately release.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.140
 And continually maintain that, that during the meditation, and ever you can maintain that also,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.000
 even in the post-meditation, as much as you can.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.450
 Particularly, applying the liberated techniques, sub-liberated techniques in the post-meditated

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.000
 status, and then do the dedicating merits, merits, all your virtues.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.150
 What a good reason, what a good purpose. A powerful sentence means that it is strongly in the heart

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.000
 and the mind, in reaching good things to every living means.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.480
 And then, follow in the exact instructions of the teaching of the Ganesha teacher, Buddha Shakyam

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.000
uni, and Gaurabhema, some of their teachings, and practice it as much as you can do that way.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And that is known as practicing the Dokki teaching and practicing Dharma.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 So that is my brilliant talk today.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 So that's it. Yeah, we stop here. Thank you.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And now we do short practices as we've been doing.
