00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
 In order to begin these practices, and again, of course, we continue many times, we've mentioned

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.850
 that, of course, you have the opportunity to set up a shrine, nice in your area, and then go in

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.000
 your home, home, and nice location, and do set up a shrine.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 Because shrine, generally, what represents is our devotion, our joy, our appreciation, our practice

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.000
, and that is what really this shrine represents.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.820
 It's beautiful, nice shrine, nice, "F" is coming, it's with your family members, and as well as

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 your friends, and "F" is there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.570
 And then nice shrine, something nice, appealing, beautiful looking, beautiful display, kind of

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 follow with the according instructions, or the lineage instructions, but at the same time, nice,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.000
 kind of that appealing, in the center of that, and then for the Buddha, Murugamma Sambo Tara,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.210
 and then for your white umbrella, or other, optimal veneration, so you put up that. And then also

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:16.000
 nice, that cheap, kind of clean, and neat, as you can every day, or those are important.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.680
 And then, we begin to practice, and as you all know, do walk three or four stations to the shrine,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.190
 three or four stations, and then sit down, uncomfortable on the cushion, person to the shrine, and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.000
 then start with the practices.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.010
 If Sambo is not convinced to set up the shrine by your friend or family member, then again, you don

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.820
't have to consider that, because as I said, the shrine is a symbol of our joy, appreciation, and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.000
 devotion, that is.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.730
 But the really shrine is in our heart, heart, that is the most important, and that is again, joy,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.350
 devotion, closeness, feeling to the Buddha, the Buddha, and the Sambo, strongly kind of unfailing

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.570
 devotion, and joy, and appreciation, that is the absolute shrine, and ignite that quality, and feel

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.000
 joy, and appreciation, and so on.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 And then, if again, commoners do three or four stations, not sit comfortably, wherever that is, is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 in the corner of the room, or the other side, and then begin to practice.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.030
 And begin to practice again, with this, and then, first we start with the ago, opening prayers,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.000
 lineage prayers, seven-line prayers, and lineage prayers, those prayers.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:07.800
 But, when you join this, feel the presence of the Gaurapayama Sambo, right in front of the sky, sky

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.800
, strongly, Gaurapayama Sambo, verbatim, verbatim, verbatim as transcendent of the Vaisra rainbow-

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.800
boarding of love and kindness and compassion, as bladed as the sunlight, like far, billions of the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.800
 sunlight come through that as one single state, as that kind of power of love and compassion, and V

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.000
aisra.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.410
 And Swaranda and Vidin Gaurapayama Sambo, all the lineage masters, and then white umbrellas, and so

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.000
 forth, all that they did, just see that, everything, and feel great joy and appreciation.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:32.140
 As I said, practice means practicing joy, practicing appreciation, practicing devotion, and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.550
 practicing six paramatas, and the patience, the tolerance, and forgiveness, all those beautiful

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.000
 things, that is what really means, practice, practice.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.330
 That practice, we are not going to live on the cushion, but with that practice, we are going to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.000
 carry with our world, wherever we go, we are going to keep that practice.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.060
 That is known as the, the really practitioners, practically. So therefore, again, we are all

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.330
 practicing, but sometimes, many times, we kind of practice, live in the room or cushion, and then

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.000
 kind of forget, when we deal with the family member, or with the world, that we miss those things.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 So therefore, indeed, those qualities are so important. And now, back with our practices.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.730
 So, sit on the cushion with great joy and appreciation, and feel this, one of the beautiful moments

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.000
, and beautiful things, that I am glorified by my beautiful natures, is so special.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 I am going to benefit to myself, and going to benefit to the others.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.200
 I am going to give a beautiful example to my family member, to the others of my work, I am

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 practicing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.270
 Really feel those strongly in the heart and mind, and may what I am thinking, what may or what I am

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.000
 doing, may it by the blessings of the old enlightenment.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.200
 I am going to help myself, fulfill that, that kind of wish, and making kind of beautiful, to set

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.000
 forward, put stuff, kind of set, set that legacy, statement in our heart and mind.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And then, join the prayers, pray of the seven-mind prayers, and as well as those prayers.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 One way of praying is, is call of our devotion, joy and appreciation, and their blessings.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:21.150
 We blend it in, completely mangled in, their optimal revelation of work and muscle, we are vocal

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.580
izing, we are here, but throughout the meditating part, we all merge it as one central state, in the

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.000
 state of the devotion and joy and appreciation.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Kind of feel that, that surroundness of the, that blessings, very strong.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.360
 And then finally, we are going to assemble all the living masters, dissolve to you, all you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.000
 continually now, do, do the rafuddhi prayers.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Rafuddhi prayers is not, not in here, so we have to adapt to that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.540
 And that is, I think, most, very popular one, is that what we have the rafuddhi in bodhi, the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:55.000
 prayers of the Buddha, sadhana, sanghe, cudane, sodyam, pionana, all I take rafuddhi in the Buddha,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, to the excellent Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, antariah, the enlightenment.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.200
 And that is, and then I'll generate the bodhi together, to benefit for all living beings in the

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.000
 practice of six-fire mothers.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.510
 Mothers, I mean that, this is just what I said, this rafuddhi to asana, you have, good to asana, we

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.000
 have bhukages, so join that prayers.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 This is a very powerful technique, rafuddhi in bodhi, in the practice of all the Tibetan Buddhists.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.200
 Many great masters said this was composed by the kentuzong devotees, kentuzong devotees, they

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.000
 prayed that.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And some said, in teaching, said it was composed by the great masters of each other.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Either way, this is composed by one of the great masters and is so popular greatest.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.080
 It is blessed by so many great masters and practiced throughout the century, all four schools of

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.000
 Tibetan Buddhism or at schools of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 They really practiced this again and again.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.500
 So in a way, we are following their voice of the devotion, their courage, their commitment, their

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.000
 joy, their appreciation, their love,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 and their kindness and compassion.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 It is so spiritual world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.550
 And kind of each world, when you join that, and of course you can join that also in English, put

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.000
 that into heart.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.230
 Not just sing, that of course sing is very spiritual, but connect the meaning to the heart, but

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:27.000
 really kind of like activate our heart with joy and devotion in both each other.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And that is very, very special.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Then we'll make something change in our systems.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 With this, we'll put those bhagrathas in bodhicitta and then this poor, boneless prayers.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Again, in the Buddha's heart, that do those prayers three times.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And each raffle gets bodhicitta three times, three times as your own.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And this poor, boneless again is so special.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 I'm not just saying that.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 And can you read what you said that too?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Can you read that and how powerful it is?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 How beautiful it is?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 How genuine statement is?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 There's no slightly stance of the ego, selfish, greedy things.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 It's total open, total crystallized statement.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 From the deep of the pure love and kindness and compassion and wisdom,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 thinking of all the sentient beings is really so powerful prayers, so special for our prayers.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.010
 As we pray and we touch that to the heart, the meaning, it is something we're doing so good,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.000
 spiritually.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.430
 Buddha mentioned so many times in the teaching, even we have one instant thought of true love, love

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.000
 and kindness thought.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 It has so much powerful benefit, so much power.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.210
 It removes all obstacles, diseases, sicknesses, bringing joy and peace, happiness to ourselves and

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.000
 joy and peace to the others.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Also, non-visible beings, they will always become our protectors, help and supporters.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Buddha said, repeated again and again.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.010
 And therefore, this loving kindness practice is one of the most powerful practices among all the

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.000
 practices.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.690
 It will also, even in the teaching, not just even in the teaching said, that just by only practice

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.000
 that,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 we will take immediately rebirth in higher realm when we leave this world, in the God's realm.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.590
 And therefore, even in the teaching said, this is called cause to take the birth in the higher than

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.000
 the should have.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Brahma rams, the realm of the Brahma, and as you know, there are three realms.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Poem rams, desire rams, poem rams and formless rams.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 In the poem rams, there are Brahma rams, where the Brahma leaves.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And this loving kindness practice is immediately directed cause to take rebirth in that realm.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 We named that.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And then comparison, and then joy, and then economic.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 I mean, it's just so much treasure. It's true.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Because we find that often, it looks kind of very casual.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 But how many teaching x-rays, this kind of statement, this kind of prayers, you really read.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 You know more about those, all the different schools, different doctrines and all that.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 This is so special.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 It's so powerful practices.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And when you sit there in the heart, in the mind, in the presence of all the enlightened beings,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 in Gurukvit Masamur, in the white umbrella, then really we're making touch.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 We're making true statement and true connection.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 We're making change.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 White umbrella, that is white umbrella.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 White umbrella is selfishness.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 White umbrella is true love, true compassion.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 True joy, and totally great economic, and great vast state of the Pandya Paramattan status.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So when we touch that, we're touching here true natures.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And then it's also our true natures.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 True nature.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 We blend in without any separation, no distractions.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 This is something so special and beautiful.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And we're making really true practices.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 We are true practices.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 We're setting up there.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 And this is, as he said, and you know, you know, this brings peace and happiness to us.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 This brings peace and happiness to others, to whole world.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 There's no better peace method, peace producer, than for all these practices.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 There's nothing, really nothing you can eat.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 There's something that you can tell us or tell me.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 We can think.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 But there's nothing else.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 This is just so most powerful.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 So do those prayers, these prayers, again, with it.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 With those beautiful intentions, and in the presence of the White umbrella,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 and Gurbel and Masambha, all lineage masters.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And that is known as the first novel.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 First novel, as he said.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 This is first novel.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Novel.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And then, finally, with the prom that was all of your generation, Gurbel and Masambha,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 all excited, all joined, because of your intentions.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Our intention, the beautiful intention, beautiful thought, they feel so happy,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 happy in the joy, and all excitedly, and then give all the blessings to us.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And that moment, they dissolve into light, and they dissolve back to you, and become,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 and mingle with the old nature of the mind.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 If you have time, do meditate for a few seconds or a few minutes.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 With that, calm and soothing, and just that is relative status.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 For a few minutes or a few seconds, whatever.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 This is, as he said, said, first novel ones.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Which is known as Jorva Sivitama, Inertities, the post-beautiful intention,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.200
 the novel, beautiful intention, with both each other, in the devotion, and rough with your

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.000
 confidence.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And now, we set up beautiful foundation, beautiful preparation, beautiful ground.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 In a way, in a building level, where we construct something,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 we set up the beautiful now foundations, perfectly foundation.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Foundation is perfect proportionally, measurement, strength,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 or quality level is perfect.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And we planted the seed on the garden, with perfectly beautiful seed,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 preparation of the soil, and all the ground, manual, whatever the soil needed,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 everything that he prepared now.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 And this is perfectly now set in our practices.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 With this, and then, as in the teaching set here, then are we going to visualize.
