00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 The Dzogchen practice is, of course, really the highest teaching of the Buddha. Every master has

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.480
 mentioned that all the time.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.840
 Now it is highest. It is the most directly teaching, but yet it is the kundras.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.120
 And also, I would just like to encourage those who complete the kundra practice with the vandrava.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.740
 If they are not complete the kundra practice in the process, just really focus on the Vedyasadha

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.200
 practices.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.440
 At least 10,000, you can call that 500 practices. We should not have neglected that because it is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040
 the linear teachings.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 Linear teachings. And that means in the teaching always, we are trespassing the treasures of the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.750
 wisdom of Rakhinees or the Dharmapalas, who God and such always said, Ekajati, Rahula, and Vedyasad

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.440
hus,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.880
 are what God, Kamthi, Dhurty, Lapas, and Palas more. They are guarding this teaching as a soul, as

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.120
 a treasure.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.640
 Why they are carrying it as our own treasure? Because they don't want to neglect it and drop that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 on the floor.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.160
 Like to cherish, to glorify ourselves. Then they will be so happy. So will be glorified.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.000
 They will be excited, happy, and supportive. Many times the teaching says, "Have you glorified

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.560
 your bodhicata and will glorify our inner nature of the mind?" Dharmapala is hovering with you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.320
 day and night, and in Rakhinees. If not have the bodhicata and realization, even if you are calling

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 Dharmapala all the time, they don't hate. Their ears are kind of loosening to the other directions

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.830
 and they are looking. They are so deep. They even don't move. So therefore this love and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.480
 competition

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.640
 both each other, join and follow the instructions of the lineage master, our country really best

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.280
 have ability. Then really Dharmapala is your own guardian and not just that. Bless that comes.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.160
 Bless is realization. Realization comes. What any teacher always read and I've mentioned many

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.080
 times, you know that. Great Master Sara said, "Realization is only coming two factors, which is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.200
 meritorious and the devotions to the lineage. Meritorious, meritorious activities are familiar to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.160
 merit, merit, and then devotions. These two combined together come to realization. So then

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.400
 bless enters. Otherwise if you don't have the devotion of meritorious activities and the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.680
 sunlight won't heat. Many times it is like hope. There's no windows. There's no walls. How

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.040
 sunlight can come. Even there's a billion sunlight outside, clear sky billion. It always stay dark

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 and cold inside because there's no openness of the devotions, appreciation, joy, and bodhicata.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.280
 Many children please. When we have that, the billion sun comes. Light comes. It shines. Bless

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.240
 it comes. And our nature booms. And that's what it's called, maturing our minds. Then it truly

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.120
 began to mature. By the condition of the blessings and our nature as a cause and cause and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 condition

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.440
 we're together and the realization booms. Relization comes. That's how early teaching goes.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.240
 Therefore

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.320
 all this is so important. So important and therefore can restrict that heart. We have to get

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.720
 realization. We like to get some different changes. That's what we should for. We have to do that.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.640
 There's no other kind of emergency exit shortcut than these Zokki teachings have to do. Or we like

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.000
 to do some shortcut and these things. We are tricking our own Salubai, our own egos. Our egos

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.440
 and our attitudes. That means we've been doing that according to teaching from the biggest times

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.240
 until we meet the teaching of the Gurda and Gurup and Masambha. So those are just a highlight

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.400
 of those. We all know that. We all just reminding each other is what the teaching says. That's the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.560
 Sangha members. We're all Sangha members in one board. In a way one board we're going together

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.920
 and reminding each other, helping each other, support each other along the path. And that is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.560
 then the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said the Sangha members. Sanghas. Connected with

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:54.560
 virtue support or virtue attitude. That's what the teaching is. Now we go to the...
