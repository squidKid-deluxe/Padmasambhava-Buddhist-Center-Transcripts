00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.110
 "So that you looked at someone, bad-headed. This song 1, bad-headed, is I'm going to highlight this

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.770
. I like this. And you look at it. And then of course I will go by the following last year's. That

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.000
 means so. But I like that. That."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.910
 "So here, of course the words he said, I'm going to teach this. I'm going to teach of the Flight of

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.250
 the Garuda. Everybody listen carefully. That means love in your respect. This the teaching, you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.000
 know, teaching is not teaching something out of the space, someone's nature or something like that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 It's not the history. It's really teaching of the nugget of our nature, your own nature, my own

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 nature. Therefore, you should listen carefully.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:05.270
 How the Traod is residing within our art, our nature. Nature. Even the Traod is residing in our

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.720
 nature, our nature of the mind. We didn't recognize this. That is how. What for the morals? What

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:17.000
 also? For that, Estonia. This Traod being so with us, never left us. Even one moment.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 But still we didn't recognize it. How awesome. How marvelous. How strange. How strange this is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 That is what is it. It's right here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.140
 So there is, he pointed out, seven morals or seven strange. How strange that we didn't recognize

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.510
 this with us. You read this. This is again, as I said, this is the teaching of the nature of our

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.000
 mind, nature of your mind, nature of my mind.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.780
 And therefore, each teaching is not pointing out somewhere else. Of course, this is nature of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.000
 somewhere else. But you always, we should point back to ourself. We're going to look to ourself.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 This is the, we're discovering our nature, our innate good.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.710
 Good. This innate good is this. It's the Buddha-nature. Right here, residing. And this is how you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.000
 read this. You read this and you strengthen your understanding.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.280
 There is seven beautiful statements pointing out that nature is residing right with us. It's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 beautiful, marvelous. The Traod is right here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So that is the first part of this section of the teachings.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 Then, the second is Song 2. Song 2, if you look to this. And here's a pointing out, pointing out

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.000
 that Buddha gave us, as I said, and you all know that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 Give 80 portfolios, different teachings. All different teachings. Buddha gave teachings and all

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.000
 those great masters, until now, giving the teachings.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.060
 Fundamentally, we're looking, teachings are all designed to discover our innate nature. Your innate

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.000
 nature.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.680
 There's nothing, take teachings, say, take advantages, till you become the winner of them, kind of

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.000
 crushing someone's.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:39.050
 Every teaching directly, indirectly tells, discovering our own innate nature, natural. That's the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.000
 every teachings, the one voice says.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:55.990
 That nature is what is our nature of the mind. And mind is where our mind is not outside. Our mind

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.000
 is with us, with you, with me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.500
 It's that, when we discover the nature of the mind, or when we see the nature of the mind, we

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.000
 discover everything.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 We discover everything, we discover the entire teaching of the Buddha Chaturmas, entire, all those

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.000
 great master's teachings, we discover.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.210
 And that, discover in that nature. That's what the second song says. How important to discover this

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.000
 nature.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.840
 Nature, this nature is mind. Mind is everything. Therefore, don't go outside. Don't go thinking

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.000
 something else to do.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.560
 Walk with your mind. If really we like to make the difference, walk with our mind. Walk with our

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.000
 own self.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.040
 If we don't walk with our own mind, doing something else, no matter how much you do, it won't help

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.000
 too deep.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.930
 It's not going to touch too deep to the root. It's just of course, on the surface, only on the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.000
 surface.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 It will help to benefit your time for a while, or a little bit to help me, but it's really not

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.000
 going to help.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Therefore, to walk with the mind is so important. This is everything. That's what it says.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Therefore, mind is everything. Mind from the mind comes from samsara, from mind comes from nirvana.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Mind is the source of everything. If we drill with mind, then we're dealing with the issue.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 That's really nature itself. It's a self-self.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And that, if you do anything here, this second song, explaining how that is important.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 If you walk with this mind, no matter if you don't know all the Buddha teachings, all these things,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 you will get the realizations. You will get the realizations.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 If you do the walk with mind, no matter how much you know all the teachings of the Buddha,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.370
 all the knowledge of the world still has become just intellectual. It's not really going to the

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.000
 deep door.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Therefore, doing it with the mind is the most crucial and important.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 And for that reason, you should walk with mind.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 So that is basically the principle teachings of this song too.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Then explaining about mind. Ourself, mind is so important.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Where is this mind? As I said before, mind is not outside. Mind is within ourself.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Also, we're not talking this time mind or others.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.750
 All the teaching tells to everyone. It's teaching to everyone. It's teaching to the mind, their

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.000
 mind.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 But individually, when we practice, we're going to think of ourself.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Looking inward, where is this mind? Where is our mind?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And we think it's not outside. Where is my mind? It's not outside.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And it is in. And where is this mind now?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Where is this mind? What is this mind is? And where is it going, this mind?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 What is the nature of this mind? And that is what this song three explains.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 All this, when you look to your mind and try to figure out your mind,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 then it is transparent, lucid and emptiness. Yet, it is here.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 It's not that negation, blank status. Mind is right here.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 That is the one. You look carefully, carefully, discovering mind is empty.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Mind is openness. Mind is a verbal status, verbal status.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.830
 So, that is what you really look at. That is what this three, the fourth, sorry, third song

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.000
 explains.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 So, that is really about that. And the fourth song.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 The fourth song, then, again, more clearly, clearly, now directly look into our mind.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Directly, our mind is where mind is coming from. Where mind is now?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Where is going out? Where is mind when out, present our mind?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Oh, where past time, where mind come from? Where past mind stayed?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Where past mind went? Where this present mind is coming?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Where present this mind is, is? Where it's going?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Where future mind is going to come? Where future mind is going to stay?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Where future mind is going to go?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And we started thinking, analyze that every time we reach to the speechless status.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 There is nothing else.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 This is, of course, in Zouki teaching, it's directly pointed out in the teachings.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 But it is still some analogizations.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 At the same time, it's introducing natural mind.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 It's empty. Emptiness mind and it's also a various mind.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Emptiness and appearance inseparable.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Mind is here, mind is not there. That is how it is.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Mind is here, we can think all this, but where mind is not there?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Because we don't mind.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 These are not methodological stories.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Peri tells, it is true. It's true. You look to your self.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 That is what Red Master said. You look to your mind.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 No one is better knowledgeable to your own mind than yourself, our self, our own mind.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Look to our mind.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 And read this teaching, look to our mind, if it's true. That is, that's it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Then, that is what we know. So, this is what this second song tells us.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Generally, when you practice meditating, what we need is most important.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 The first is, of course, all the devotion, joy, the appreciation, and for relaxation thoughts.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Those are so important.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.260
 Once we have those thoughts, sizzling thoughts, then the second thing that is most important is

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.000
 confidence.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 You have to have confidence to your wounds.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 When we are practicing, we are not going to linger with doubt and hesitate.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 That is hindrance.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.490
 So therefore, this innerization will help to establish our confidence in our practice as mind is

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.000
 empty.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Mind is empty. It's not just empty negation.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Mind is appearance. Appearance and emptiness are inseparable states.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 This is what we need realization. That is, we need confidence.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 This confidence means nobody can shut up your confidence.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 True, it is true.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 When it is true, nobody can change that.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 You have certainty versus us.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Therefore, then, this is the realization with this.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 You carefully accept that.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 This is what the nature of the mind is.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 It is empty.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Appearance and emptiness are inseparable states.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 That is song thought.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 The song pimp is explaining about how our nature of the mind is pure.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Our nature of the mind is completely pure from the beginning.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 It is never deluded.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Deluded.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And therefore, the great Master Shabashek, if you read these texts,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 at the beginning of time, the Buddha Samadha Badra or the Buddha Shakyamali,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 we are equal. There is no really difference.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 No really difference. The pure from the beginning states.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 It is all the same.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 But how Buddha Samadha Badra become the Buddha and how we deluded?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Deluded.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And that is explained here.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 We hear the same nature, same polity, same potential, same thing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 But how we deluded and then Buddha reached the enlightenment.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.230
 Because Buddha reached the enlightenment by seeing that all are the display of the true nature of

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.000
 the mind.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.720
 By seeing that, by recognizing, by realizing that everything is the display of the nature of the

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.000
 mind

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 and that moment reaching enlightenment or become no more delusions.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 But we didn't recognize our perceptions or in the roughly, we went through those last years.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 So if you like to go, you can know there is more.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:42.250
 But this so very simple to tell, we deluded, we didn't recognize our perceptions, our displays as

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.000
 our perceptions.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 We carried away with this thought and then we deluded.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 We deluded, then we started wondering that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Buddha recognized immediately when the appearance appeared from the display and then immediately

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 reaching enlightenment

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 or Buddha reaching enlightenment and we didn't recognize that nature.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then we deluded in the samsara.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 We carried by then emotions, we subject, object, continuous that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 So that's how this all, all happened.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 From that, then all the different emotions arise.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.250
 When senses are recognized, they're the angels and then that means you start grasping, clinging and

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.000
 throw that.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 All the duality and then start different things, different emotions arise.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 We continue carried away with that.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 So those are five songs but it really, I highlighted that.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So those are what we went through last years.
