00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 The spiritual or the virtues, or the nature. If we don't use this terminology as spiritual or the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.300
 virtues,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.300
 we can stand firmly on the ground of the way our nature is. We can stand. Stand.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.940
 So therefore, this teaching, Dharma, known as in Tibetan, 'Chuja', so it is correcting and

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.500
 protecting means.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:37.990
 So Buddha gave this teaching from ed. 35 to ed. 82, or 81. And that whole teaching is divided into

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.500
 three groups that you all know.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 And those are known as the Three Turning Wheel of Dharma.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 Three Turning Wheel of Dharma, Grand Master Unjiba said in his teachings that from ed. 35 to ed. 82

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
, he gave the first turning Wheel of Dharma,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 or mainly the first turning Wheel of Dharma that he gave. From ed. 35 to ed. 82. So it's 42.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.980
 And from ed. 43 to ed. 72, he gave the teachings, second turning Wheel of Dharma, is he gave the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.500
 second turning Wheel of Dharma.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.730
 And from ed. 73 to 82, that Grand Master Unjiba said 782. So he gave the teachings on the third

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.500
 turning Wheel of Dharma.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 So that, entirely teaching of the Buddha character meaning, that we heard so many times, 84,000

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.500
 teachings, or 12 excellent teachings,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 and all that can be summarized within these three. Three. Three that he spoke that teaching.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 That all teachings are, teachings is correcting us from the negative habit of evidence that spoil

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.500
 and make mess to ourselves, to others,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 at the same time protecting ourselves to continually going from wrong directions.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 That is all entirely teachings of that. These teachings are also, as we go a little more, a little

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 bit more con-pacifically,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 and that first teaching is not teachings, mainly teachings on the post-turning,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 it's teachings mainly on the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 vinaya teachings. Vinaya teaching is what? Vinaya teaching is teachings on the morality and the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 karma and cause and effect,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 cause and effect teachings. So Buddha be morality teachings. Buddha be teachings on the karmas,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.600
 so that we cannot feel wrong to the wrong karmas, even karmas. But we have to also give the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.500
 teachings on the cause and effects.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.500
 Whatever we see in this world, there is nothing is not coming from the cause.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.240
 And we like to have the good resolve, good true effect. We should be smart to the cause, good cause

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.500
.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 Thinking of the good resolve, performing the bad, bad or the bad cause, never going to come.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:45.500
 That is pulling, pulling, pulling. F-O-L-I-N, right? F-O-L-I-N, even pulling ourselves.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Be smart with the cause. And we like to be good resolve, good effect.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 So Buddha give extensive teachings on the cause and effect.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 These teachings are known as mainly teachings on the as you say.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 Vinaya teaching, but content of Vinaya teaching is mainly all that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 All morality teaching, karma, cause and effect teaching, all that known as morality teachings.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 Vinaya teaching, all Vinaya teaching, and karma and cause and effect teachings are then known as

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 karma, also morality teachings, morality, many of these.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 And then Buddha give the teachings on this one.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:53.460
 From the teachings from 42 to the 7th, from 43 to the 7th, 7th to the 7th teaching is the second

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.500
 turning well of dharma.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:04.140
 That teaching is known as mainly teachings on the concentrations, meditations, meditations

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.500
 teachings.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 So giving more detailed teachings on the meditations and concentrations, teachings.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 And third turning well of dharma, that is teaching known as the abhidharma teachings.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 It is mainly teachings on the verses, verses and teachings.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.510
 So now again if you look more, I'm sure many of you have heard this. Buddha's teaching can also be

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.500
 divided into two groups.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.760
 Those are known as philosophical systems, these teachings are known as definitive teachings,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.500
 interpretable teachings.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 Daphanetic teachings. Daphanetic teachings. Daphanetic, I think. Daphanetic.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.500
 In that word, it says, "Nedu" and "Tandu".

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500
 "Nedu" means "Daphanetic teachings".

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 "Tandu" means interpretable or changeable teachings. So Buddha give the teachings.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 So therefore again interpretable and definitive teachings.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:24.000
 This interpretable teaching is mainly the first turning wheel of dharma, is interpretable teachings

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.500
.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.500
 Second turning wheel of dharma is completely definitive teachings.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 Third turning wheel of dharma is messages. Daphanetic teachings, interpretable teachings.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 So that word. And now again think of what that means, interpretable and definitive.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:53.500
 Independable means it's not always that way. It can be changed. It can be changed.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 And the law of dharma, cause and effect can change. Not always the same. Same thing.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.900
 Variety also can shift things, can change. And dharma can be changed. It's not always the same

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.500
 thing.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.940
 Therefore, for example, good dharma and bad dharma. And so also good dharma can become good and

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.500
 good and good.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:31.500
 Bad dharma become bad and bad bad too. I mean all that is known as interpretable teachings.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.500
 And daphanetic teachings such as second turning wheel of dharma is daphanetic teachings.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:46.430
 That means it cannot change, exactly as it is. What that is, that is for example the great

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.500
 teachings on the great impedance.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:57.500
 Emptiness cannot be changed, cannot be shifted, moved. It is as it is, it is.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:06.500
 That remains the same thing. Always emptiness, the absolute truth, exactly as it is.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500
 And then third turning wheel of dharma is messages.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:18.730
 Third turning wheel of dharma, Buddha gives teachings, on the particular teachings, on the clarity

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.500
 of the emptiness.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 Clarity of the emptiness. Emptiness is not blank emptiness.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:32.500
 Emptiness is full of the energy, vibration, full of energy. I should not say vibration.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:41.840
 The clarity is full of the energies, energies. And such as then what a nature, our own nature of

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.500
 the mind.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.500
 It is not just only empty, it has all beautiful qualities.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:57.500
 Together with empty mind. Mind, that cannot be changed. That remains the same thing.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.990
 Nature cannot change. And then also Buddha gave in the third turning wheel of dharma, gave the

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.500
 teachings on the karmas,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:15.200
 lot of teachings on the karmas, lot of religious teachings on the pure land, lot of teachings on

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.500
 the heavens,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:26.310
 lot of teachings on the hell rings. All those things, those all teachings are relative truths, can

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.500
 be changed, moved.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.500
 So therefore, it's called uninterpreted teachings. That is the frame of the teachings.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.500
 Now this harpsutra is what? Harpsutra is the second turning wheel of dharma.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:45.500
 Second, it is teachings on the definitive aspects, definitive teachings.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.500
 Teachings on the emptiness, emptiness teachings. So that's how this teaching is.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:01.140
 This teaching, also how Buddha gave the teachings, how Buddha, what Buddha, when Buddha gave the

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.500
 teachings,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:09.100
 what, how he taught or gave the teachings. There is about three different ways that Buddha gave

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.500
 teachings,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:19.500
 or explained the teachings. Those are teachings are known as, as Buddha spoke directly by himself,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.500
 directly teaching that spoke directly by him, teaching that come by the blessings,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.500
 teaching that give the authority of the permissions and permissions.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.500
 So those are the three different channels Buddha gave the teachings.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:45.500
 And Buddha, direct his own world of teaching, teaching him directly his own world, world, that is,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:51.500
 this is very famous, renowned sutra, or Pandya Parama, the sutra, known as dota pa.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:11:04.500
 In Sanskrit, setzaya gata, setzaya, S-N-T-X, S-A-N-T-S-A. I think that's a rough one.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:15.500
 Setzaya, setzaya, not setzaya, setzaya gata, gata is G-A-T-H-A, setzaya gata.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:24.140
 So that is Buddha gave directly that teaching from the beginning till end, the whole things Buddha

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.500
 gave the teachings.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.500
 But the other thing Buddha's teaching has also many times, dialogues and so forth.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.500
 But he says, just from the beginning till end, he gave that, all the teachings.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.500
 So that is directly his spoken teaching examples. There are many, many others too.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.500
 But the other day, of course, even dialogue teaching is Buddha's teaching too, teaching that so,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.500
 but all that.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:57.500
 And the second teaching is known as blessed teachings, teaching that come by blessings.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.500
 And teaching that comes from the blessings, that means,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 teaching that comes from the blessings of the body, Buddha's body,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
 teaching that comes from the speech of the Buddha,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.500
 teaching that comes from the blessings of the Buddha's mind, or his mind.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500
 Teaching that comes from the blessings of the Buddha's body,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 there is sutra known as dota sattipa, sutra of the 10th Bali.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:33.500
 That sutra Buddha in the teaching says, Buddha put his hand, hand over the head of the bodhisattva,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 known as dota yimpu, he put that head over that Buddha and that moment.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:48.500
 This bodhisattva had great, received great blessings and opened his wisdom

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:57.500
 and gave that teaching of the dota sattipa or 10 Bhumi suttas teaching that gave that.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:05.500
 So that is the example of the sutra that comes by the blessings of the body.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:11.500
 And the sutra that comes from the blessings of the speech.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:18.500
 And the other sattras, very famous king, who was then become very devoted,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.500
 but at the beginning of the time he was influenced by the devadatta

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:30.500
 and become very contagious or very, what's called, very challenging.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.500
 And the father was so devoted, the Buddha, but he lacked the opposite,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.500
 against the Buddha, and therefore again, against the Buddha.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.500
 But later, because of all those reasons, he killed his father.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:55.500
 Father died after a while in the teaching, he said that one time his son,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:06.500
 his son got, what's called, big pampas, abscess, abscess.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.500
 Abscess on his son got big abscess on his head.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.500
 His son is now really so painful and crying and all that,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.500
 and of course they give him medicine and all that.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 So then the Arya Chaturb is so worried about his son, and to do this.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:32.500
 So his mother came there, and now of course his widow came today,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:38.500
 and she saw her grandson's experiences.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.500
 And so then his son, who was Arya Chaturb, was worried and sad and all that.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 And then she talked to her son, the Arya Chaturb, and said,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.500
 "Don't worry, this is the kind of, your family has these sicknesses.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.500
 Your family, you had that same thing too when you were young.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.500
 So it won't be too bad, it won't go too long.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.500
 It just didn't happen to them. It happened. So you had that."

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.500
 And then he said, "I had that, that these sicknesses?"

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 He said, "Yes, you had that sickness. You got that abscess."

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.500
 So then he said, "When you, your mother said, when you got that abscess,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.500
 the King's father was so much worried, worried and sad,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:29.500
 and this abscess, the King's father, saw his own mouth, own mouth.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:36.500
 My father did that to me?" He said to mother, "Yes, that's how he worried,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.500
 and he did his own." And then he felt so sad, that I killed him.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.500
 And then he can't remember all that.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:53.500
 So he felt such sad and grim, and also causing that big obscuration, bad karma.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.500
 So then he became very devoted to the Buddha Chaturbani,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500
 and then he came to the Buddha.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 So Buddha gave Mejushini, told Mejushini,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:14.500
 "Shri, please purify the obscuration and karma of Adya Chaturbani."

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.500
 By saying that, then Mejushini gave Suttara,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:29.500
 known as clearing with the bad karma of Adya Chaturbani, that Suttara gave.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.500
 So that is one of the leading examples of the blessed by the speech,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.500
 and the Mejushini gave the teachings, that Adya Chaturb.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.500
 "Oh, sorry, so my yoga sahron do, my ji do yoga sahron do."

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.500
 That's the interview, that which is a conscious.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.500
 Then examples of the worst of mind blessings.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.500
 Blessings, this heart suttara is one of the leading examples

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.500
 of the blessed by, worst of mind by the Buddha,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 and through that all kind of ripple effort came one after another.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.500
 And that blessed to the Jai Reze, Avallagiri Shurah,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500
 and that immediate effort to the Shari Buddha,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.500
 and then all this teaching came.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:23.500
 So these are the examples of the worst of mind blessings.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500
 So that is how this teaching came.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.500
 And so that is really about how this teaching comes from now.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.500
 And then another way, about heart suttara.
