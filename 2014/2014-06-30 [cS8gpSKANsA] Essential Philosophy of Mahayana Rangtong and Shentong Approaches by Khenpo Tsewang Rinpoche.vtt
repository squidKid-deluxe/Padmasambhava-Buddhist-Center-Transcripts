00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you again, thank you very much Professor Murali Froganiam, and again thank you very much for

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 your coming, and thank you very much for organizing this event and coming out here every year, and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.000
 I'm very, very happy.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.030
 We used to go with my brother, very great teacher, and we used to go, and he and my wife so many

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:31.210
 times, William Patterson since making in 80s, 80s, and we had the opportunity to visit your

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.550
 beautiful school or the universities, and the great halls, and have beautiful delicious lunch, and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.000
 then in the cafeteria or there, and then go by, so there's a lot of memories of William Patterson

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 University.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.680
 Universities and I'm very grateful and honored to see you, and meet with you again in discussing

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.000
 the teaching, according to my knowledge and capabilities.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.660
 Thank you again, and so now I understand you all starting, particularly this time, Buddhism, and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:18.210
 also among the Buddhism, and just exploring the meanings of the random and the yendong texts, so I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 will try and tell you a little bit about this.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 Generally you already know, all teachings of Buddhism came from Buddha, and who came 600 years ago,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:40.940
 and he was one of very kind, compassionate, and wise, and very beautiful, adaptable, great teachers

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:50.000
 in human history, and truly he brought great peace and joy, harmony, and respect, and thankfulness,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.370
 and confidence, and trust to each other, and themself, and hope, and vision. All that we discuss

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.060
 and tell in the human world we want, then he explodes in the world that's so beautiful to everyone,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.000
 and his kindness and compassion and love has no discriminations at all, by any means.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 All the living beings, you see, everyone has beautiful, everyone is existing, because everyone,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.750
 because they're there, because powerful of us or something, there's nothing, everyone is so related

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.300
, connected, and beautifully, and biologically, and emotionally, feeling level, and many levels, it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.000
's the same, and he has planned that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Truly, it's not just the making of that, but he said this is what it is, all nature is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So within that contrast, this is not only yet to get true, because you all know Buddha's teaching.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Every living being has inherited Buddha nature. Everyone can become like him, that means.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.660
 By him, or there is also in Buddhism, there's many great enlightened beings, Buddhas, Pimal Buddhas

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.000
.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So this enlightenment of Buddhahood is not reserved by anyone, selected groups.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.990
 Everyone, if they work for their nature, their beauty, and goal, with it right where, according to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.000
 the contrast, where the nature is harmonizing, break that, then we can explore and bring,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.080
 be ourself, as like Buddha, and that's what, because he said, everyone, he's not just making up,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 and he's trying to kind of nice and polite,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 but that is the way the practice are. Everyone is in that natural status.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.770
 So with that level, that contrast, and then this Rangdong and Yedong became, and generally, Rangd

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.000
ong, Yedong, of course, I think you must have studied,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.750
 it comes from Buddha nature. And this is, Buddha nature is, in Buddhism, known as Osanskic language

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.000
, is known as Dathagatangarbam,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 or the potential or the nature of the Buddha, Dathagata nature.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 This Dathagata nature is inherited to every single living being.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.230
 If they have feeling, they have thought, and they have emotions, they know what they're doing, and

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.000
 they like to hope, and vision, and goal,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 or that every living being inherited, that nature, there is no really difference to everyone.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So everyone has this nature. And even though externally they may be experiencing many different

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 difficulties,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.420
 and circumstances, up and down, and all these things, but in the reality level, everyone has this

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.000
 nature, and so beautifully staying.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.330
 And in Buddhism, also called, there's not just only we came at first time. There is life after life

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.000
 we go through.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.190
 And not just this is the beginning of our we will go life after life in the future, but we came, we

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.000
 did that in the past.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 According to Buddhism, there's so many lives that we talk.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Even no matter what the situation, the circumstances, and challenges we go through, Buddha nature,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 this Dathagata Garbha is never really changed by any means.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 It remains the same as it is.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.820
 When you are heavily obscured, you are heavily in the trouble, in a difficult situation, Buddha

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.000
 nature is never changed.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.800
 And when you are in a creative pine, or pond in a time, good time in everything, that it also

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.000
 really didn't change anything.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Nature remains the same nature as it is. So that is the Buddha's teaching generally.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And this is of course the teaching comes from India and went to Tibet.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And so, and when it came to Tibet, then this random and gentle terminologies are kind of like,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.540
 they brought up and the great masters and great thinkers, these great logicians, they really

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.000
 brought up.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 And then they start debating on these things, random and gentles.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And I think you already started, random, what means?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Random is both terminologies that are written.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Random means self-empty, or empty, self is empty.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Run is self and is empty, self is empty, or self-nature is empty.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.050
 Self-nature is, yendong means is empty by the others, other components, empty by the other

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.000
 components.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 So, which they are talking about, is talking about this Buddha-nature, Dathangata-garbha.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And they say, Buddha-nature, self is empty.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Self-nature of the Buddha-nature is empty, and that is known as runtong.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And some other great masters used to highlight this terminology, yendong.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Buddha-nature, the other components are empty.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 So that's indicating something is not empty.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 This also came in the Buddha's teaching.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 It's not just that these great masters start interpreting different ways.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Buddha-nature, Buddha-teaching, what it says in Mahayana teachings,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 but regularly this terminology is very popular and famous in the Mahayana Buddhism.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Buddhism, in the Mahayana Buddhism, again, there are many Buddhism schools,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 and this Mahayana Buddhism, what is the teaching said?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 In one of those great many suttas, everyone says that in one of those known as suttas,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 known as Mahapari Naranasuttas.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 In Mahapari Naranasuttas, Buddha said, "Before Buddha is going to pass away in our language,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 going to pass away, he gives a lot of teachings, a lot of seminary teachings."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And those are all teachings that are connected together,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 and known as then the teaching before the passing way, teaching of the before passing way.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 In that teaching, for example, this is just one example.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 That teaching said Buddha is permanent.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Buddha is continuation.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Buddha is absolute.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Buddha is indestructible.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Buddha is never changed.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 That's what the Buddha said.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Buddha is permanent.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 So with this, this many great masses, oh, Buddha nature is not empty.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Kind of like, say, it says it's permanent.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 It's like indestructible.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 There's nothing changed.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So therefore, what is empty?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 What is going to empty of the components are the cover of things.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Buddha nature is covered by the many defilements.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 That is empty. That is going to release or removed.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 But nature itself is not empty.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 That remains same as it is.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 For that is called then yin-tung.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So yin is what?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 The other components is those emotions, those obscurations,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 what the Buddhism calls obscurations.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 That is going to be emptied.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 That is empty.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 That is going to leave out of the Buddha nature.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 But the Buddha nature will stay remained.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 That nature remains, stay remained.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And some other great masters said again in the Buddha's teaching.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 That is, for example, in all the teachings of the Pandya Paramatas.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Buddha said there is nothing is, anything is existing

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 from the samsara to all the within the Rana or to the enlightenment.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Everything is empty.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Everything is empty. There is nothing is really existing.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Anything that is substantially solid, everything is empty.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And all the humanity, all the form is emptiness.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And sound is emptiness.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And trees is emptiness.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Smell is emptiness.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 And everything, the mass is emptiness.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Metal is emptiness.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Everything is, even the enlightenment is empty.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Emptiness.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So that means its nature is empty.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 In that status, then these great masters use the terminology.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Rantang.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 The self is empty, empty, empty.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Self nature is empty.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 So therefore, these two terminologies arises in this Tibetan Buddhism.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.750
 These great masters started, then lot of debate on this, these issues that you, maybe that, those

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.000
 books.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And that our, the migration teacher and the brother, Kenji Vardhisharambhuchi.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And he's also, of course, I had opportunity to join with him and to have those books.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 So in that teaching, then explaining that how all is empty.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So this is the, what really is started.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Now everybody kind of talk, how we will know that we have the Buddha nature.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And that is again, in that teaching, must be read in the book.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And again, the great masters many times mentioned.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Mentioned because we obviously will know that everyone has Buddha nature.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And that is a very famous Indian great master.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And also, according to Buddhism, he will be coming future.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 He will become one of the great teachers or the Buddhas in the future.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And in his teaching, his teaching, then what he said?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 He said, everyone has Buddha nature.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 No one is exception.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 I mean, he said, and I said, well, as the Buddha Shakyamuni said many times.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 That as he can highlight that, he said, everyone has Buddha nature.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Because you see the Buddhas, you see the Buddha Buddha Buddha.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And therefore everyone has enlightenment nature, nature Buddha.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And and then the nature.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 So you see the Buddha and nature is the same.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Everyone has the potential.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 That's what his great master said.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 So what that actually really means.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And we use this kind of like simple.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 I'm trying to put the simple.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Even though it's a big talk.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 But trying to use the simple.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And we use the examples of that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And there is a lot of like, maybe I use examples.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 A lot of orange seeds.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 When you eat the oranges.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Orange seed comes, right?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 So there's so many orange seeds.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 In one side we eat all the orange seeds.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 In the other side we see the orange itself.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 One orange.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So now we're going to look to these two things.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 The seed of oranges and orange itself.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And now we say, hey, somebody said, hey.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Where this orange comes from?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 This orange comes from where?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 It comes from.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Then they start to think, where this orange comes from?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 I see the orange, definitely.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 It's beautiful.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Beautiful, golden, whatever, that's yellow, round.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Where that comes from?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And then somebody said, hey, this is true.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 You see this?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 But it comes from maybe really from this seed.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 There's so many seeds hanging out.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 There's one orange.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Definitely, I think this orange comes really from this seed.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 This from seed.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Seed.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 So therefore, by seeing this, this orange is not just going to come by itself.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 It's just happening, it's not.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 But it really came, truly from this.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 So therefore, this orange seed, even though this time don't really look like orange.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Orange, but definitely it has the orange potential to become orange potential.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Because I see there's this beautiful oranges.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 That's what we call, known as by looking at the result, the fruit,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 and the doping of using the inference, truly this seed has potential to develop this, this orange.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 That's what in Buddhism we call, because you see the result.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Therefore, at that, this seed have that potential.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 That potential definitely exists, even though you don't see now.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And then we see, again, now the second question.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Even though you have the seed, you see these two things.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 But how that can happen?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 How? How that can happen?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 That is the name this great master used.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Nature is equal.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Nature is equal.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Nature has no partialities.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 The pervasive nature is equal.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 It's called the equanimity status, emptiness.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 All the openness, the infinite, the freedom.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Same thing, nature is not discriminatory.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Oh, I like this seed only, and I don't like this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Oh, I like only this orange, I don't like the seeds, the seeds.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Never say, nature is open.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 If there is a circumstance and a condition put together with this,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 this, definitely this will, this can develop to this.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Nature is completely open, equal, equal.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Therefore, if this made circumstances and conditions

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 of joyful effort or conditions that accordingly nature needed,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 not something completely different, but accordingly that harmonizing beautifully,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 then definitely this will become this orange.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Orange.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So that is then the second, this reason, the nature is equal.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Therefore, every living being can get enlightenment.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Every day walked hard.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Every day did the right ways.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 It's not just walking hard and selfish enough, but right ways.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Every year do this, this.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And put that again with this.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Now you look to the, suppose you look to the orange, it's sun,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 and it's kind of like deducting or for an inference,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 this seed will develop the orange.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 It will, this seed, this result come from orange seed.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And now, so third one is looking itself, itself.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 From the seed side to the result, result, result.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Hey, I see this group.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Hi, this group say that.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Hi, looks like this orange is the other side.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 How we can these oranges?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 They all talking.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I think so.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 We have the same potential.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Every we do the right way, whatever he did or this orange did,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 every we do the right way.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 I think I will become like this tree because nature is open again.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Same way, nature is equally open and natural.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 So, therefore, therefore, everyone has opportunity.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 That's it.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 This great master use reason.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 It's called reason.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Reason that everyone can get enlightenment

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 and develop the right ways.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Right ways, not the wrong ways, right ways, right?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 What is right ways?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And that is harmonize again.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Harmonize exactly the nature itself.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 We're the nature.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 That means this case.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Nature of the Buddha.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Buddha nature.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 I'll talk about that.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Buddha nature.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 What is Buddha nature is now?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Buddha nature is, is now what it's talking.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Buddha nature is love, true love, true compassion, true wisdom,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 true respect and appreciation.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 That is nature's component and openness, freedom.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 That is nature as that.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 So, now what we have to do right way is to do right, right way to do it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Then harmonize, exactly as it is.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Bring more love, more kindness, more compassion,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 more respect and appreciation, more openness, more discriminate in that.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 That activates whatever you continue to do.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 And then what it does is radiating that energy, that power, that qualities.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 But at the same time, it's exploring the beauty.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 You glorify your own beauty, your own beauty of the Buddha nature.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 As it is developing, as it's expanding, bending,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 then it's known as in Buddhism, following the path.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 You really develop, following your developing.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 This path is not following externally some path, but it's inner path, inner journey.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 You really exploring, developing.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 As much as we develop, that much is expanding.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Because Buddha nature is limitless, is boundless.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 The power of the Buddha nature is boundless and limitless, boundless.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 It's totally pervasive.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Even Buddhism, the Buddha teaching, it's like sky.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 And what we did, what we did, why we become like this, this,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 because we did the unreleased activities.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Something not natural to this, to the Buddha nature, we did.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Which is then kind of self-important.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And then we developed to make the self-important, to protect the self-important,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 we kind of developed such as known attachment.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 And then to protect or to glorify that, that our self is thought to be.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And then we developed anger, hesitation, doubt,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 jealous, and so forth, disrespectful, harsh.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 All those comes, all those comes, those are not natural.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Because the nature of the Buddha, our nature, is your nature.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Our nature, that is love, kindness, compassion,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 joy and appreciation.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And that is then opposite, is disrespectful.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Opposite with love is what?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Unkindness or anger.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Opposite of compassion is attachment.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And opposite of love and kindness is jealous.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And all that we developed, and what it does,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 is then it's kind of like completely cover up, cover up our Buddha nature

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 and become completely shield.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And then we are, our Buddha nature is not really shining very strongly beautifully,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 as should be, because of cover of this.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 So therefore, then this is, this is when it's developed,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 that all this, this cover of things, when it happened,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 it's called, it's happened since we started self-important attitudes.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Or ego-cleaning Buddhism.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Cleaning, that happened.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 This is not really the nature of the Buddha.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Buddha nature is unnatural.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Therefore, that can be released.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 That can be removed, because it's temporarily developed.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 It's an everlasting, it's not natural.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 It can be released, removed, and that is known as gentle.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 It's something that you removed, that you can remove.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Clean up that, clean up, and that, that is gentle philosophy.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And then nature is then begin to shine as much as we clean up

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 and cover up that release as clothes begin to shine that.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 That is the gentle technique, which is very beautiful technique.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Same thing.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 But then, what is random?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 And this random is then, again, nature is empty.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Nature itself has no solid entities, even though it is.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 It's continuity there, but it's not something that solid metal or mass,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 or is not like solid malacres or atoms, right?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Atoms.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 It's not.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 It's open freedom.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 That is known as the random.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 It's self-empty.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 And both are completely natural.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 The outskirt or surface or this goal of things is removed.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 And then that nature is totally open, relaxed, even the continuation,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 that quality is continuing, but there are no substantial entities

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 that exist as solid levels.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Why did Buddha use those terminology as a permanent,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 all those permanent, indestructible?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Because that nature, call it this, is permanent.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 It's not permanent in the sense of the solid, as a concrete object,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 but it's continuously inherited.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Nature exists, all living, living right here.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 It's nothing changed.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Today, for that reason, it is Buddha used as terminally, as permanent,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 interchangeable, indestructible, because nature is always as like sky.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Sky never changes.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Sky we can say permanent.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 But there is no substrate, solid, existing, entity of skies.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Same say Buddha nature is.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 So is permanent and as indestructible is not solid, existing.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 For those reasons, what in the teaching always said,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Buddha nature is the beyond of the permanent and impermanence.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Buddha nature is beyond of the existing and non-existence.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 This existing and non-existing thought is our duality mind.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Mind trying to hold something.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Holding is again the same thing.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 It's grasping.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 It's not naturals.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 We have to release that ties.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And then we will reword the true beauty of us,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 nature has and Buddha nature has.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 So that is my really kind of like talk and introductions of the Buddha nature.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 If you have some questions, then I'm happy to discuss.
