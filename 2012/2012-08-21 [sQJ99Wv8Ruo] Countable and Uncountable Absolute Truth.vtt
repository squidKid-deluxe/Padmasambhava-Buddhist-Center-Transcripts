00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 Once you have that understanding very deeply, stony, perfectly, then you show the second absolute

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.280
 truth which is then incountable absolute truth.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:33.600
 That means no poem, no I, not using as word absolute truth. Straight forward, straight forward as

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.560
 it is, no poem, no I.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.350
 That means everything is ordinary, is empty in status, yet it is, is apparently state and the union

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.840
 of the absolute and relative as it is ordinary.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.380
 There is nothing really needed. Nature is nature. This is all. So then, therefore, you may then

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 show this countable, sorry, incountable absolute truth.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.120
 Because of these two reasons, in the bodhisattvayanas, then as you heard, Svatrantika Madhyama

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.640
 schools and the Prahsangma Madhyama schools,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.290
 that also two schools mainly developed from where they are ushering to the student or the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 practitioner's intro, the enlightened status, or where the practitioner is ushering to the beyond

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.640
 the grasping.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.740
 And there is Svatranta Madhyama school and the Prahsangma Madhyama schools. So now, so that is

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 really about the absolute truth and the relative truth.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:00.740
 In the reality level, what these two are? There is two different things. No, it's all the same.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.640
 There is no really two different things.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.360
 Only looking at different angles of this, the nature or this phenomena of ourself, only we are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 looking at different angles.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.510
 When we look at the different angles, then there is aspect of emptiness, there is aspect of the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 appearance, and therefore, it is known as one natural, two aspects.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.560
 Both are same. Even though they are different, looks like quite different in the duality mind, it

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 is same. There is no difference.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.180
 Relative truth is absolute truth. Absolute truth is relative truth. There is no difference. It is

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.640
 one natural, two aspects. That is what these two truths are.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:07.640
 Now, so now, how we see? Now, this emptiness. Emptiness. How are we going to say emptiness?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:18.800
 It is the same way as in a kyarvaka yana and a partigbudayana as we discovered or as teaching two

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.640
 of the egolessness.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.090
 And this is the same method. Nothing is any difference. We have to establish it. The first, or I

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.640
 mean way of establishing this is the first personal ego every speed.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:45.130
 Again, where is this ego? Where is my ego? It is out or it is in, it is talking, looking, searching

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.640
 through the top of the head all the way to the bottom of the feet.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.640
 Searching, looking. There is no independent existing 'I' of egoless.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:06.640
 And then where is the focus now? That is really about the sub-egolessness, emptiness, realizations.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:16.640
 And now, looking to the knowledge or this external identity of the all egolessness.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:26.640
 And now, for example, we think of this table. Where is really this table? Where is this table?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:36.640
 Again, looking thoroughly, trying to bring separate table from these formations.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:46.710
 And there is no separate table from these formations. And then this formation is something existing

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.640
 originally? No. It is just temporarily. Somebody did this.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:01.650
 It is nearly arrived, newly created version of that. So this table, what is this table then? It is

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.640
 this name. Name and the formation that we put there.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:16.710
 That there is no really actually table came with that word or this formation. We name it. And the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.640
 formation itself is the same way. It is combination of so many elements.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:32.650
 As we went this morning. The interdependent coordination system. So many. There is no one solid

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.640
 entity with this table materials.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.330
 There is so many things. So many combined. And the gross level. Pile, water, wind, earth. The poor

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.640
 poems. Those poor causal poems.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 And then so much. Then boat element, ferro may be larger, that which means art element. So forth.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640
 It is just combination of that.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:06.110
 And then behind that, again it goes deeper. It is all started with atoms. And then if we go from

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.640
 that atoms, again go that job. It is varnished.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:19.750
 There is no substantially existing art. This event, that table. This is example of all these

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.640
 phenomenal objects.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:33.130
 Mountains, rivers, lands. Everything is same in that structure. There is nothing any personal or

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.640
 especially structures at all.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:46.710
 All is the same way as hallucination. Therefore it is called hallucination. Hallucination, all

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.640
 artificial.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:57.740
 It is just a form. Therefore in the Buddha's teaching, bubbles, dreams, mirages. Those are used,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.640
 those words are used to wake up us in the reality.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:15.130
 This is everything like this. It is there, but nature is empty, solid. And then so what is this

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.640
 cling is? Thinking of this and that, this and that, all that.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:28.510
 It is all is mine. There is nothing really substantially is coming out to us saying, "Hey, we are

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.640
 that. I am that." It is all we named.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:43.690
 We named, we hold, we grasping, we preserving, we teach, we spread that knowledge. That is what did

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:44.640
 continuously.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:54.200
 There is no substantially existing. So therefore, the subject is empty, object is empty. All is,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.640
 that is what is called emptiness.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:06.710
 Emptiness is not just negation that is not there. Emptiness means there is no substantially solid,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.640
 existing.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:15.640
 It is like rainbow. That is what it is. This is everything this is.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:23.740
 And when you have that realization, glimpse of the realization or the theory of this realization,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:31.640
 then that is known as we establishing the views of the emptiness of the truth.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:40.640
 The views of the emptiness of the truth, that which we established. Because it is empty.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:49.740
 Relative is empty, and empty is relative truth. Both are equal. And that is why in the teaching, in

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.640
 the Pandya Paramata and other teaching, or Harsutra teaching, other teachings,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.300
 the poem is emptiness. Emptiness is the poem. The poem is no other than the emptiness. Emptiness is

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.640
 no other than the poems.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:18.050
 This Buddha said, from the life, this all the poem, I will get 12 ayatthana, 12 nadanas, and 12

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:23.410
 interdependent ordinations, and only 5 parts, 10 bhumis. All is natural, is empty. All is empty in

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.640
 status.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.720
 That means there is no substantially solid, existing status. And that also means that mind is

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:38.640
 emptiness, our mind is emptiness, subject is emptiness, objects are emptiness.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:46.640
 When you have this realization, that is known as then the emptiness of the true egos.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:55.230
 Ego, self ego, and knowledge, or this object ego, or object identity cling, under the object, cling

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.640
 on the identities.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.640
 This vogue clings, our need to be removed.
