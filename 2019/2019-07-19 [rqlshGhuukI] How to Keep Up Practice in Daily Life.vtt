 "Some practices can be derived, not can be, not same as that can be, can be divided into two so

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.580
 easy understandings, so we have to capture something. This is also of course, we are practicing,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 but same time we are studying, we are contemplating, studying and contemplating, so therefore it's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 good to know as much as something tangible knowledge in our mind or heart or brain and heart, so we

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000
 can observe that and activate that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.150
 So therefore, again, of course you all know it's not something that I'm talking new things that you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.990
 don't know. Again, I hope it will be a little bit reminding to you all of us, to me, to you all.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:52.890
 And that is known as the FSCA again, and yoga of the meditation and the yoga of the post-med

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.000
itations.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.210
 That indicating also the practicing always, not just the practicing short time, whatever the time

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 you do practicing on the sitting on the cushion and then kind of left the practice completely with

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.000
 that, with cushion. That is not the idea.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.490
 And what we can do, really keep the practicing, even you left the cushion, but keep up that with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.130
 the practices. How we can keep up that practices? Really those fundamental practices, such as joy

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.000
 and appreciations, bodhicchathas.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.580
 And then also all this phenomenon existing is the magic of the splits, magic of the splits. Life is

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.000
 precious and everything is permanent. Cause and effect are inevitable. Samsara has challenges,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.370
 challenges, conduct those attitude, even for a second if you can bring up, those are known as

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.000
 keeping up the post-meditations.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.860
 And also thought, if you can bring up those thoughts, what is known? Also they are mindfulness,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 really money. It will bring ourselves back to our homes with all. It makes ourselves more calm and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.000
 more rich.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 If you can take those, not just left only during the left there with the cushion or the inside, but

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.850
 if you think throughout the daytime, as much as you can, even per second, it is practical in stock

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.000
ings, very practical.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.520
 And we have to be practical. To be good practitioner, it is important to be practical. Not just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.000
 only looking one side, or honest kind of saying, "Oh, this is not this and that."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.190
 Put up from the grass root, be humble, be simple, looking for more courage and commitment and more

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 distortions. Then really truly they are known as you are moving forward, warriorships, warriorships

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.020
 As Bodhisattva, known as warrior to the enlightenment, Bodhisattva, Sancha Sambha, warrior to the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.000
 enlightenment, you are keeping up that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.070
 That's how we keep that. That's not just only during meditation, but we keep that in the post-med

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.000
itation too.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.020
 So that is yoga of the post-meditation. Yoga of the meditation now can be divided into two

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.000
 categories.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Yoga of the weak, creative stage. Yoga of the complete stage practice. These two practices.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.340
 I already mentioned that yoga of the creative stage practicing is you activating the relative truth

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.000
 as enlightenment.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.800
 In sutra teaching, Buddha never taught to yourself to become as enlightened or everything is

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.000
 enlightened. Only in the dandara teaching, Buddha wanted.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 That's why called dandari is sugaric teachings, direct teachings, that point out.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So, now yoga of the visualization of the creative stage, yoga of the complete stage.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.140
 now visualization can be also has
