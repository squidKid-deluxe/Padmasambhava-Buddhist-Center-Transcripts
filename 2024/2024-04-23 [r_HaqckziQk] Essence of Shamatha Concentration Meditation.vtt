00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 It is a really good Shamatha meditation. And the Shamatha generally is a sangra role, which means,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.040
 which you all know, the focus of it, but calmly abiding. Shamatha in it really is called the Shineh

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.040
.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:24.330
 And the Shineh is always said, in order to have the good Shamatha meditation, you have two

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.040
 obstacles,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.040
 three principal kind of hindrance of the Shamatha, is the distractions.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 Distractions is the obstacle for the Shamatha meditations. So there is how many?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 First maybe there is two, obviously. First distraction is physical, physical distractions.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.530
 First verbal distractions, the physical verbal distractions. And the second, third is then mental

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.040
 distractions.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:17.440
 And those are in the debate. And mind, body, and speech are free from the engaging activities of

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 the Jaws things.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 So that is, you are now free from that. Now you start meditating.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.190
 Meditating, while you are meditating, our mind is again completely destroyed by the consumption

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.040
 support.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 Then our Shamatha will not become good, stable. So we have to free from two things.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 From the Mandic Jaws activity, busyness activity, and as well as free from the conceptions.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 So this is a true free from. Once you have that pre-preach, then you are going to meditate.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.580
 And always in the teaching said, when you do meditation, think of the physical body, think of the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.040
 speech, verbal, think of the mind.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.040
 So these three things you have to think. Now think of the body, think of the, have good postures.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.040
 Always there is a good posture. Those are seven postures of the Buddha, Venerable Jaws.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.740
 And that many of you already know, seven postures. So sitting, simple literature, sitting on a

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.040
 cushion, we have cushion.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:47.110
 And then straight up, straight up, and then elbows up in the meditation postures or relaxing mind

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.040
 postures.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.960
 Put that with palms on the knees, like this, straight up, or elbows, the palms put together and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.040
 below, never centers.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 And then third is, third posture of the Buddha, Venerable Jaws is extending the shoulder.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.270
 So that means the shoulders are not hovered, and kind of extend, extend and extend your chest a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.040
 little bit more.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:27.570
 And the fourth one is, straight up your back spine, straight up, kind of keep up exactly straight

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.040
 up.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 And this fifth posture is, then next on the backside, this backside or the front, just a little bit

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.040
 same, and bend slightly towards that, but it lines up our spine.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:04:00.660
 And that is, I think, fifth. Sixth is, and looking towards tip of nose, nose, and then seventh is,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.040
 keep the breathing normal and touch your tongue, tip of the tongue, upper root of the jaw.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.040
 Yeah, those are, in the teaching said, seven posture of the Buddha, Venerable Jaws.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 What it does in the teaching said, it will balance the channels.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.330
 When channels are balanced, that means nerves, our own nerves are balanced. Nerve balance is what

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.040
 it does.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.540
 Then our energy, moving wind will balance. When wind is a little more balanced, it will naturally

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.040
 help to calm down our mind.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:49.570
 So those are the body postures. And the speech of postures and the teaching said, then you know, do

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.040
 yourself alone.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.330
 Do the breathing purification exercise. Clear way all the included areas that we are wondering,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.040
 hovering in the channels.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 Clear way those breathing purification exercises. Clear way. Do those gently, slowly.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:18.250
 What the pollution air? Pollution air of the anger. Pollution air of the attachment. Pollution air

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.040
 of the ignorance.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.730
 And pollution combination of that. In the teaching said, those air or those energies are hovering

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.040
 on the surface.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.530
 For example, when you look at the space, when the sky is polluted, you can see it not able. It's

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.040
 not too far.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 All our, so our body is polluted. The channels are polluted with these emotions.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.040
 So when you do the breathing purification exercise, you clear that. And also you can meditate that.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.040
 It's all unclear. Posture and clear with all the polluted air of the related with the anger.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.970
 And the second, when you do polluted air related with the attachment. Third is polluted air of the

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.040
 ignorance.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.040
 Do those three times, so you can do that. And then, those are known as the balance of the speech.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.130
 That's what the teaching says. Why the speech? Well, the speech is A. Of course, what the teaching,

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.040
 what the teaching means, you know, how the speech accounts.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.040
 It's speaking because it poses the mind. Second is when the mind activates the wind.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.040
 And that wind and the mind are both pulled and then echoing or ejecting to the, to the nerve system

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.040
 and then the voice comes up.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.950
 So fundamentally, it is so sound, it is really the mind coming. But then it is supported to

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.040
 activate that with wind and the channels, the nerve system.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:07:00.040
 So therefore, it is the mind. And then balance of the mind. Now, that is so important.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:08.870
 Even we have the perfect both postures and perfect those balance of our ears. We don't keep the

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.040
 balance of the mind.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.050
 Then, really, it's just not too much meanings. So therefore, now, so important to keep the balance

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.040
 of the mind.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:26.530
 That is then meditation. That is it. And meditation, there are so many meditations or so many samad

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.040
his in teaching method.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:35.040
 But every summarize, the great master Kamala Shala said also too, said all the Buddha's teachings

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.040
 of samadhis meditation can summarize into two.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.360
 And that is also a great teacher. Buddha himself said too, all meditation, every day can be

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.040
 summarized into two.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:55.040
 What those two are? This is the shamata in the vipassana. So now, vipassana meditate.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.040
 The first, sorry, shamata meditate. Shamata meditate, as I said, is the first stage.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.040
 Shamata meditate, what it does, we are taming our mind.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 Our wild restless mind, we now try to train. As like those horse timers, train the horse.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.040
 Or elephant timers, train the elephant. Similarly, we are taming the mind.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:31.040
 Our wild mindful. What means the wild is restless mind. Mind is restless.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:39.040
 It just goes everywhere. Can't stop. Even one second. Second, that's our mind.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 And that is treblered. Where is it happening? On the surface. Like ocean.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.040
 Ocean surface is just so much like sometimes wind comes. Then it just stirs.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.040
 But according to the teaching, the deep down ocean, it stays always calm.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 It's only that happening on the surface.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.040
 Similarly, this treblered of the mind moving is only on the surface.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:16.040
 Deep of the mind is Buddha nature. Beautiful, strange, calm, peaceful, soothing.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:24.040
 That's what it is. So now, this, but even though deep of the mind is so calm and peaceful,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.040
 all calling it, we cannot penetrate. We can reach today.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.040
 Because it completely blocks this treblered of the mind.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 Buddhism is the mind. Therefore, then we are training ourself. Taming our mind.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 What does the Ganesha teacher Buddha say? Subjugated one's own mind.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.040
 This is the teaching of the Buddha. So we are subjugating. We are taming the mind.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040
 What is subjugating? Wild thought. Wild conception.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.040
 We bring to the gentle, peaceful states. That is what.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 So, Shama the meditation. And that Shama the meditation has two meditations.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 They are called Shama the meditation with the correct stress

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.040
 and with all the correct stress.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 In the Tibetan, Shama the meditation is two hours.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 Two Shama the meditations.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.040
 And the fourth is, for example, correct stress.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.040
 That means you are going to concentrate, hold something.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.040
 And many times in the teaching meditation, you can do them in two ways.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.040
 One is with breathing or other is you can concentrate on the Buddha images.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.040
 And we have the Buddha stages.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.040
 Even if you don't have the Buddha stages, you know the Buddha.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
 You see the Buddha stage right in front of you, in the you.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.040
 There is the Buddha stage. Buddha is residing.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.040
 Master Danda was the land of body. Full of love, full of compassion.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.040
 And full of kindness and blessings.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.040
 And it's just so brilliant.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.040
 So color is like a golden mountain.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.040
 What in the Samadhyar suttara that we joined in the morning,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.040
 the Buddha's hand, the great Master Mohan Madhya,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.040
 both that is quotation there.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.040
 Buddha is so beautiful.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:38.040
 Every aspect is so pleasing to see, or pleasing to see.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.040
 And color is a golden color.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.040
 And concentrated on that image of the Bhutva image of the Buddha.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.040
 That is the meditation of the bodhisattvas.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.040
 That's what the teacher said.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.040
 So when we meditate, either on the third eye spot of the Buddha

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 or the heart center of the Buddha.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.040
 Concentrate, feel strongly and concentrate.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.040
 That means, concentrate on me, you all know.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:16.040
 Your mind is now with the Buddha's heart or Buddha's third eye spot.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.040
 No, no, not anywhere else.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:27.040
 That is, for example, we are anchoring down our willingness mind.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 And not letting to go to anywhere is running all the time.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.040
 We are taming the mind, time, T-A-M-I-N-G.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.040
 Taming the mind while in mind.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.040
 So concentrate on that.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.040
 And hope how long it can stay.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.040
 Stay like that.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.040
 But at the beginning of time, even if you have that concentrate on that,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:03.040
 mind won't stay because of due to all our kind of where we be.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.040
 Mind is activating.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 It's because it is his own habit.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040
 He will be again running away.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.040
 Again, moment you see, come back, same way.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.040
 No complaining, no comforting, no making any kind of wise, this and that.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.040
 Concentrate on that spot.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.040
 Keep doing that.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.040
 Keep doing that.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 Keep doing that without any kind of feel bad or all that.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 At the beginning of time, in the teaching, there are five different experiences in meditation.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.040
 When you do the Shama, when you know, when we do the Shama, the meditation,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.040
 five different experiences will come.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.620
 very, very experienced.
