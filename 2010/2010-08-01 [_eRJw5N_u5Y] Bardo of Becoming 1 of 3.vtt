00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 Becoming a bardo of he had isolated a river, and then of course you will need to be river, river.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 A bardo of the becoming, a bardo of the possibilities is then almost the average person is 49 days,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.600
 or 40 days is dependent. So this most of the time, 49 days, is really the bardo of becoming bardo

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.100
 of the river.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 That we go through. Now, one we didn't recognize, and we miss that. Then in the teaching set, now

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 what is developed?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:58.020
 Now we, even though our physical go, the true physical go, but now you develop suddenly, home as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.700
 mental body.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 Mental body is similar as in our dream, dream body. We, in the dream, we go many different places.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 That time we are not really going our body, the physical body, we are going dream body or mental

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 body.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 This time, now we are going with the often known as dream body, also mental body.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 Mental body has what it has, it don't have the physical body among the five other pets.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:48.310
 But poor advocates there, so they are feeling, there is perception, conception, and cautious

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.700
 advocates.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 So in a way, you have four among the five advocates, you have four advocates.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 Now these four advocates, this is called mental body. Mental body is very, now very unstable.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:19.200
 Generally, the bardo who are in the bardo state, they are very, very unstable, unsecured, uncertain

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.700
.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.150
 There is, in the teaching said, there is about five or six different uncertainties. Place is

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.700
 uncertain.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 And then where you rely is uncertain. Food is uncertain.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.700
 Friend accompany, accompany uncertainty. Conduct is uncertain.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.700
 Your appearance is uncertain.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.360
 So, everything is, in a simple return, everything is really uncertain, unenvironmental, is very

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.700
 uncertain.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.700
 Certainty. Place is uncertainty. You go everywhere.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.990
 There is no, it's so light, as a dream, so light, you can, the moment you think, that moment you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.700
 are there.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.700
 There, and there is no, also blockage. You can go through the walls. You can go through the earth.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.700
 You can penetrate anything, anything except Buddha Gaya and the mother's womb in the teachings.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.700
 They are calmly connected, mother's womb, then you can go through it, through.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 But otherwise, for the Buddha Gaya, you cannot go through it. Because Buddha Gaya is so powerful.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.700
 Buddha is so powerful. In fact, in a story, or in an ancient Buddhist teaching story, say,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.700
 Buddha Gaya is, in Buddhism, we don't call Buddha Gaya, or in literature, don't call Buddha Gaya.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.700
 They call Vedra Asana. In the Tibetan language, we don't call Buddha Gaya because,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.700
 exactly, they use what translated from Sanskrit, Durgiddin.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.700
 Durgiddin is Vedra Asana, I think, Asana.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.700
 We translate that into English, Vedra Trump, or Vedra sport.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700
 So, it is Vedra, indestructive sports.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700
 In the teaching said, for example, this universe is formed.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.700
 Of course, it is formed. It is stained, then it is crying, then it is gone.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.700
 But even this universe is completely gone, this very universe where we have,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.700
 this earth is gone with fire and water and wind.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:00.700
 But Buddha Gaya, in this free sport, will still stay in the space as a wall,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 as a ball, or in Tibetan, or in the teaching they use called,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 like the golden ball hanging, looks like it is hanging golden ball in the space.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.700
 By similar way, the Buddha Gaya, in this free water sport,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.700
 where it still cannot be destroyed by the fire, water, wind,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.700
 even the destructions of this earth is gone, they still stay in that.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.700
 Because it is a ball sport where the Buddhas have got enlightenment, all Buddhas.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.700
 And ordinary in the teaching also said, it is a long time ago,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.700
 when all the stars still started forming, forming at that time.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:56.700
 This is also, I think we are related to the methodologies of the industry.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.700
 And in that time, and gods and us were always fighting,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.700
 that their jobs are there, they fight.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.700
 And many times, gods are losing their battles.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700
 And most of the time, because they have weak weapons,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.700
 they don't have really good weapons, so they are losing their battles.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.700
 Now they need really, of course, missile defense assistance.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.700
 And where do you have to missiles?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.700
 Where do you have missile defense assistance?

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.700
 And then, of course, there is another one of those.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.700
 But anyway, so they need that.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 And they all thought, how we can have this.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.700
 There is one great sage.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.700
 Say, his name is Razong Xiontong in Tibet.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.700
 Xiontong means drinking yogurt.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.700
 And this is Rishi Xiontong.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.700
 His bones are completely fragile.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.700
 His bones are really fragile, fragile and indestructible.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.700
 So all thought, if he had his bones and made weapons on that,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.700
 then we can really defeat Asura very well.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.700
 So then, they all went to him, all gods,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.700
 such as Indra, Brahma, Vishnu,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:30.700
 and all went to Xiontong to ask,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 because in our situation, we lose the battle with Asura,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.700
 and we have your bones.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.700
 And by weapons, we can defeat all that.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.700
 And then Rishi then finally argued that he will give his bones.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.700
 But then, in the till, he said,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.700
 because they don't want to spoil his bone,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.700
 it's so special, no?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.700
 And once he did, it's just, cow came,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:01.700
 cow lagged, licked his all, precious,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.700
 and they left the bone alone, alone.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.700
 And then they met, and all the different weapons,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:18.700
 weapons spear, well, and then Vajra, and they met.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.700
 And when he started making the dust for the Hunan, the Buddha,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.700
 and that formed, formed then,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.700
 this very formed place where the Buddha is.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.700
 So it's so strong. That's called the Vedic Asa.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.700
 But this is the mythology style.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.700
 But in the teaching field, because all Buddhas reaching enlightenment,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.700
 1,000 Buddhas, a poor Buddha reaching enlightenment in that sport,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:09:00.700
 and then 90s, 1,000, pardon, 986 Buddhas will get enlightenment in the same sport.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.700
 So it's very powerful, blessed sport in teaching.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.700
 So therefore it stays.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.700
 So therefore, even this mental body cannot go penetrate

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.700
 through the Buddha's ground and the Mother's wall.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.700
 That's the teaching style.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.700
 So, otherwise, this mental body is restless.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.700
 Restless, and so restless and uncertain.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.700
 And then, who is uncertain?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.700
 Also, often in the teaching field, you won't get food

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.700
 and not what you like, deep desire as well.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.700
 Therefore, in Tibet, on the Vedic Asa teaching,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.700
 they do a lot of ceremonies, which is called swords.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.700
 Swords and those ceremonies related with our spiritual eat,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.700
 our food offerings in fire, fire by smoke, smelling.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.700
 Smelling. So, so are those truths.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.700
 Also, they dedicate it to you that you can get.
