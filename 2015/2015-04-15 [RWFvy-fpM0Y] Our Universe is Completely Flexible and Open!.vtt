Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche continued teaching on Lama Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol's \"Flight of the Garuda,\" focusing on Song 10.\n\nIn this teaching, Khenpo Rinpoche explains the Mahayana and Vajrayana view of our universe according to the Buddha' famous teaching, the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Garland Sutra). Our universe is already completely flexible and open, and is merely a display of the true nature of the mind. Be amazed by the vast cosmological scope of these teachings!\n\nThe Buddha's Vajrayana teachings explain this in even greater detail, and all Vajrayana meditation practice is based on connecting to the already enlightened nature of everything we experience.\n\nEnjoy the magical display!",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 This universe, the whole, is also the flexible. Everything is in flexible, everything is open, open

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.800
 situation, open status, and all that is also in display of the true nature of the mind.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 And in the small scale level, larger level, very larger level, everything is in conceivable states.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.600
 Mind, the nature of the mind, is in conceivable states.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 Therefore, it is open and disciplined. Nature is also in an inconceivable state.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.860
 This is again in the Buddha's teaching, such as the Avatamsaka Sutras, and then of course also in

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.400
 Vajrayana teachings.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:58.240
 And this is again, this is in the teaching said, this big Buddha, the whole universe is within the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.000
 enlightenment Buddha states, that is, whole universe.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.300
 This universe is not just one universe, the hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.000
 universe is all in one state of enlightened states.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 And each of these Buddha is known as the Buddha Verochanas. Buddha Verochanas, so everything is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.160
 within the middle of the Buddha Verochanas, within the state of the Verochanas, within that state

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600
 is each pole of the body of the Buddha Verochanas.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.240
 There is also hundreds and thousands of the pure numbers, one pole of the body of the Buddha Vero

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200
chanas. There is hundreds and thousands of the pure numbers.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.370
 And there is oceans, also called the beautiful ocean waters. And each ocean water state, there is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.200
 also many beautiful islands, many beautiful things, hundreds and thousands.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.410
 This is not just this universe, this galaxy, if I say galaxy, there are hundreds and thousands of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.800
 galaxies, hundreds and thousands of galaxies, galaxies after galaxies, and pure land, all of that.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 And our world is one fraction of that, according to this, one fraction of this, our universe.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 And according to the teachings here, this is so enormous, inconceivable status, and this Buddha V

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.800
erochanas is in the posture of the, as the economic models, economic models.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.120
 Economic model, within the economic model, there is inconceivable oceans, the center of the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.600
 beautiful oceans, oceans.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.560
 And this ocean has, within the ocean, there is so many flowers, and so many petals, again, so many

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.000
 universes, all the universal worlds.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 And so, now, in the right middle of the, again, there are so many lotus, and so many flowers, or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 lotus, maybe I say stars, little lotus, and so many lotus, and so many universes, in the center of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.800
 their lotus, one lotus, lotus, as, of course, there are so many pistas, pistas.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.600
 Each pista contains also so many worlds, so many beings, so many worlds.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:41.040
 And our world is the center of the pistas. Center of the pista has 25, 25 volts, if I say, 25 volts

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.800
.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.620
 The center of the pulse is climbed up, so is, is stuck one up another, is, all the universe is

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.600
 stuck, stuck, right? Stuck up.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 So it has 25 universes, or volts, stuck up, up there.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.200
 That is just one pistol of the many pistas that has, so our, that has.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.400
 And then, that our universe, or this, our world is, comes to the universe that reach to the heart

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.200
 level of the Buddha verityam.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.070
 And it is the 13th, in the teachings, 13th level of the universe, because there is 25 to go, all

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.200
 the way up to here.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:34.360
 13th is, 13th is heart level, in the teachings. Because with the heart level, therefore, in

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.200
 somebody, I mean, in the teachings said, because we have the verityam teachings.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 And not every, every universe, world has verityam teachings. We have this world as verityam

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200
 teachings.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 Verityam teachings are heart teachings of the Buddha, heart voice of the Buddha.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 Buddha, in their senses, is in the heart level, and therefore, this world has universe.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.290
 This universe is also very emotional universe. Emotional is called, in a, in a teaching name, as

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.200
 manjichen, in Tibet, manjichen.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 That means, in unbreakable, land of unbreakable. Or maybe not, shouldn't say unbreakable.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.200
 Inseparable. Inseparable. Land of the world of inseparable. Inseparable.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.200
 What that means, in the teachings said, is in Tibet, manjichen, manjichen. What that means, means,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:46.200
 our, this, the beings of this world, is very difficult to detach it from the emotions.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:54.340
 To detach it from very gross emotions. Very strong. Very strong, and therefore, it's called manjic

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.200
hen, in separate, land of inseparable.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.200
 Or, in, in can't separate it. Can't separate it. Can't separate it emotionally, easily.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.200
 Easily is strong. But according to verityam teaching, having this emotion is very important.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.990
 That's why manjichen can be activated very easily, and very beneficial to get, to drop the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.200
 realization.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.410
 Of course, although it may be more disturbance, too, but it is a very beautiful candidate, or

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:35.200
 weaker, weaker to bring the realization of the, of the, the realization.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.820
 So this is what he is, this is what he is, the great Master Shabbat Shalom.
