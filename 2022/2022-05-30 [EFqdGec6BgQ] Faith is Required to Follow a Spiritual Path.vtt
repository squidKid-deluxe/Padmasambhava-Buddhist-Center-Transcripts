00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 But they, as long as we follow the spiritual path, we need devotion. We need faith. We don't, we

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 are that faith and devotion. We are completely blocked by the ego, blocked by self-importance.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.140
 When that comes, what are they? Skepticals, doubt, hesitations, trust in mind. And we are not

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.000
 settling our spiritual path. We are not settled.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.920
 Even we are thinking we are settled. We are wandering together in the Buddha teaching the old

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.220
 living beings, the other gypsies, in a way called the Noah, means the mover. All the time it's

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.860
 moving. But then, above that, we think spiritually we set the path. We are going to follow the path

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.000
.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.740
 But our hesitation, doubt, skeptical, everything is done. We are not really set. We are lingering,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:16.000
 wobbling, shaking. And we are undermining ourselves, our growth, our progress and development.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 Therefore, really, to have the joy and devotion and confidence, faith, F, A, I, C, F, A, to the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 lineage.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.290
 A lineage, what is? It's not something that we try to listen in the oboe or kind of like the alpha

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.780
 ones. No. We have inspired ourselves with this lineage master in the practice, in the practice med

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.000
itate and what they taught.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It's something that is really running to our air, those teachings. And it's running to our heart.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 He sings. It comes down so beautifully. It's loving-kindness. It's complete.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.570
 You are in respect with everything. Openness, openness, and beautiful that nature. How wonderful.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.000
 How good it is. That is what really the devotees.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.600
 So, this lineage, praise, all the devotees, we then connect it to the lineage. The stillness, the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.000
 golden chain of the lineage, we connect it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.940
 As God, by myself, is connected to the lineage, we are connected. As a long team, by connecting it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.000
 to the lineage, we are connected the same way.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:53.220
 Really, we are a king of God and that wisdom, that compassion, that blessings came from 2600 years

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.000
 ago, every called Buddhist level or in Dharmakaya level.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.200
 But from the ridiculous time came, now it's absorbing, merging into our heart and mind. How

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.000
 wonderful. How good it is. It should be great. I'm not kidding. I'm not just singing.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 It's something, something beautiful opportunity in our short lifetimes. Why am I saying short lif

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.000
etimes? I mean, how long we know how long we will be here?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.290
 Who knows? Who can guarantee? But where we're at right now, we're doing some good things that were

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.000
 directly connected to our mind, to our heart.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.230
 Then of course, we're doing all the different things that are supportive things we take care of,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.000
 that do.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.460
 But besides this, something personally connected to our heart and our mind is the practice. That's

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.000
 why you're really glorifying that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.960
 According to teaching, that goes with us, whatever we develop with mind, that goes with us,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.000
 according to Buddhism.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.900
 According to Buddhism, we all know, life is not ended right here. This is not only one. It's a

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.000
 continuation game.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.620
 As like this, yesterday has not ended this. And yes, today is here. Tomorrow will be here. It's

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.000
 continuation. Same way.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So therefore, this lineage phrase is so important within really whole-hearted universe.
