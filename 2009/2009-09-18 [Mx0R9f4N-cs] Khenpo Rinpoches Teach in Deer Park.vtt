00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 [Crowd talking]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [Crowd talking]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.640
 So, after when Buddha become the Buddha, or after Siddhartha become the Buddha, and then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.720
 the Indira and Brahma, they recursive to turn the Wheel of Dharma or to give the teaching.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.200
 Buddha accepted the recursive, and the Buddha is coming from Buddhagaya to here to give the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.560
 teaching, because he saw this is the perfect place to turn the Wheel of Dharma, and so he

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.920
 came here, and that time he has five former disciples during his ascetic time, right?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.600
 Ascetic time, time, time, and just before the Buddha become getting enlightenment, and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.360
 so they kind of didn't really feel happy with the young princess, the practitioners, and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.640
 because before they saw happy, the Buddha is so attentive, ascetic practice, ascetic

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 practices, around just before the Buddha is getting enlightenment, he went to this tone,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 and he accepted some offerings, particularly what's called very rich muck-pudding from

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.680
 young lady, and they thought, "Oh, Buddha now is falling back to the desire realm, and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.520
 now look at this, he's breaking his rules, or vows, he's accepting those rich food from

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.680
 the young girls, and all this, so better we won't stay with him, he will become out-dementful,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.080
 and we cannot provide all the helpers we can leave."

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.160
 So because of that thought, they left, they left here, they decided to come here, and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.360
 when Buddha accepted the teaching, when he became the Buddha, he saw these five students,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.280
 or five of these purpose are the perfect connected purpose to receive the first teaching, so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.280
 they invited us in here, so then Buddha walking this way, and also they heard that the Buddha

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.200
 is coming, and they thought, "Okay, we're not going to see him, because he's chasing us,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.240
 or coming, running after us, and now he will demand all us to do a lot of work, whatever,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.200
 so we're not going to really pay any attention, we're not going to respect or welcome anything,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.880
 we're going to just pretend that we even never know him, like never going to speak that."

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.240
 And they met their rule, inside they met the decision that they said each other that, but

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.720
 when the Buddha is coming close, Buddha is so powerful, so splendid, so kind of majestic,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.880
 so calm, and so peaceful, so soothing, and it's just like coming, kind of the big sunlight

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.800
 is coming towards them, they couldn't keep up their promise, or what their inner decisions,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.120
 immediately, someone come up, welcome the Gautama, and are you tired, you need, are you thirsty,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.680
 and all these things they started doing, and then, so Buddha sat down, and Buddha said,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.080
 don't call me Gautama, or just a regular name, I'm the fully A-worked one, and I'm ready

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:28.040
 to give the teaching, so that sport is, I think, from Varanasi, maybe you saw, is called Jokhandas

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.400
thu,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.240
 but that is the place everyone says, that's the place where the post, he met his five

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:53.680
 former five disciples, and him, I think they used to be big stupas, but after so many changes

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.800
 came in India, throughout the history, and then when the Muslims came, I think they destroyed,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.540
 and at the top there, they put their, what's it called, the mosque, mosque or something, so it's

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.680
 like

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 Muslim monuments, but that is the really sport, where the Buddha, post time, they met his five

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:28.760
 disciples. Then Buddha and five students, they walked here, and walked from there to here,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.840
 and that is the right sport, everyone says, here's this the sport, where Buddha came here,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.600
 moment Buddha came here, and the teaching said, there's like, just naturally a bird, stone,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.660
 throne here, here, and Buddha walked like, kind of like, what's called, sarcomambalar,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.240
 claw-wise way, claw-wise way walked, and then Buddha sat on that throne, and we did five

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.480
 disciples, and there's so many animals came around here, and there's so many animals from the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.920
 Deer Park, and 80,000 celestial beings surrendered to the Buddha, and give them, then first, first

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.720
 is Paul Noble to the teaching, so everyone said, this is really the sport, where Buddha gave the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.680
 teaching, because, and many people were kind of think, this is the sport, because I showed

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.280
 up at the pillar right there, and this is the sport here, that's what really Buddha gave

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.320
 the first is teaching, for now, through the teachings, and then through all of them.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:17.240
 So, these five students, when they received the teaching, the first time we heard, or

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.320
 when for now, through the teaching, when Buddha gave, immediately, one of them reached the

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.880
 Arathahood, instantly reached Arathahood, and in that, in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.800
 he, there's, in this world, there is a tree Arathas, first is a Buddha Shakyam himself,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.480
 and second, he is a disciple, and then Buddha repeated that for now, through the teaching,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.200
 three times, at the end, four of them also reached the Arathahood, then in the world,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.160
 there is six Arathas, that, and so, but this is the very sport where the Buddha first gave

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.400
 the teaching, and, you know, always say that throughout that sense, then there is a lot

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.680
 of Buddhist activities always there, and then, of course, Indian don't have exactly really

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.960
 big history recorded, that exists, I think, treated so many changes, happened, destroyed,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.680
 or whatever happened, but always when we read histories of the Tibet, and as well as, particularly,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.000
 very famous Chinese pilgrimage, that, who came here, I think, fourth century, and around

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.120
 the seventh century, their record is so precise, and so kind of detailed and thorough, and both

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.640
 are explaining, there is so many monks who are residing, and even, I think, over thousand,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.800
 two thousand monks reside here, and practice in meditating, and particularly, in this area.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.560
 So, this is the sport where the Buddha gave the first noble, for noble truth teaching.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.400
 And so, this, and therefore, it always said, this is the birthplace of the Buddhism, the

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.760
 Buddhism, the peaceful love and kindness, the compassion, non-volence, that really teaching

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:06.640
 begins right from this sport, that's what everyone does agree, so that's it, that's

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.240
 the brief, his story, brief introduction, even though, I think, you all know, but that's

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.320
 again said. Okay, thank you. Thank you.
