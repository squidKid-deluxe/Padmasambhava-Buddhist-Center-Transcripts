NOTE     "synopsis": "On April 2, 2017 at Padma Samye Ling during the One Month Dzogchen Retreat, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche announced that a long-standing dream of Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and his was coming true:\n\nToday begins the carving of five New Stupas that will be installed in the Padma Samye Ling monastery meadow!\n\nA 20\u2019 (twenty feet) Enlightenment Stupa will be placed in the center, surrounded by the following stupas in the four directions: a 12\u2019 Heaped Lotuses Stupa, a 12\u2019 Many Doors Stupa; a 12\u2019 Complete Victory Stupa; and a 12\u2019 Mahaparinirvana Stupa.\n\nThese five stupas honor and commemorate Buddha Shakyamuni's birth, enlightenment, teaching the Dharma, extending his life, and mahaparinirvana.\n\nThe five stupas are made of solid volcanic rock, and are being hand-carved in Indonesia by an expert craftsman.\n\nThe carving will take about one and a half years, and the stone is said to last for over 1,000 years!\n\nThe benefits of building stupas were spoken of by the Buddha in the Noble Amazing Sutra:\n\nAnanda! Any devoted noble sons and daughters who fill this entire three-thousand fold universe with the seven precious metals and make offerings to all the stream-enterers, once-returners, non-returners, and arhats\u2014as well as all the sangha members in the four directions\u2014do not accumulate as much merit as someone who makes a stupa to the Tathagata\u2014the Subduer, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the One Who Entered Mahaparinirvana\u2014 that is even the size of a churura seed, with a central column the size of a needle, an umbrella the size of a juniper leaf, and filled with grain-sized statues and mustard seed-sized relics.\n\nMoreover, in the Analyzing Activity Sutra,\n\nThe Buddha said to the brahmin son Netso:\n\nWhoever builds the Stupa of the Tathagata will gain the eighteen benefits. These are: (1) to be born in a royal family, (2) with perfect features (3) and a beautiful body; (4) who everybody loves to see (5) and looks to as a leader; (6) with fame expanding in the ten directions, (7) beautiful cheering sounds, (8) and praised with beautiful verses; (9) very detached from the world (10) and honored by gods (11) and humans; (12) very wealthy, (13) with a long life (14) and as healthy and strong as a vajra; (15) possessing the major marks (16) and minor marks; (17) born in the upper realms; (18) and soon to enter the supreme enlightened state.\n\nMoreover, the Noble Stainless Beams of Light Sutra states:\n\nNoble sons and daughters! Whoever circumambulates or make offerings to a stupa will be blessed by Tathagatas, move to the supreme enlightened state through a non-returning path, and purify all of their karmic obscurations. Even if the shadow of a stupa touches birds, animals, deer, or whomever, they will not be reborn in the lower realms.\n\nThus, in the sutras and tantras the Buddha taught extensively about the benefits of building stupas, as well as the benefits to those who support and make contact with stupas.\n\nIf you would like to support this glorious, meritorious project in honor of our lineage masters, or a loved one, please go to the PBC website ( http://www.padmasambhava.org/projects_gs3kstupa.html ) or mail a check payable to \"PBC\" to Padma Samye Ling monastery, and note in the memo who the donation is being made on behalf of.\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n\nDedication\n\nAs Buddha Shakyamuni said in the Sutra teachings, if you build a temple or stupa that represents the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, it will bring tremendous merit. Even when it is gone, the dust of this place will continue to generate merit and benefit to all those connected to this project. According to that, we dedicate this merit.\n\nBy this merit may all obtain omniscience.\nMay it defeat the enemy, wrong-doing.\nFrom the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nFrom the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.\n\nMay this virtuous merit advance the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni \u2013 particularly the Nyingma teachings.\n\nMay this merit radiate to all donors, supporters and their friends.\n\nMay all their heartfelt wishes be fulfilled according to bodhichitta and may they have long life, joy, peace, realizations, and good health.\n\nMay this merit bring long life and limitless Dharma activities to all the holders of the Buddha\u2019s teaching.\n\nMay all beings find joy, peace, and the fulfillment of their wishes, and be guided throughout their lifetime by the Three Jewels, and may they all reach buddhahood.\n\nMay the elements become balanced.\nMay there be an end to natural disasters, war, famine, and sickness.\n\nMay this world have peace and be blessed with a shining and everlasting Golden Age.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.560
 Today I just have to announce our long-wish or long-lasting dream that we had a long time.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.160
 Those who are really going too close to fulfill or come to the realities.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.960
 And that is, we all know, we all talk so many times about the stupas.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 We talk about stupa on the lower meadow and that during the Indian religious time, during

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.240
 the bell, who is talking that.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 We had so many times that we wish to do, and kind of delayed all the reasons.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.600
 And then 34 years ago, we thought we really can activate that quickly.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 When we look more closely, it becomes more complicated, more complicated, and so difficult

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.320
 to do.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.120
 And so now, we've got big dilemmas, dilemma of what to do.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 Do it loosely.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.600
 Every aspect has really become more kind of quite heavy and difficult.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 So finally, then, now, we decided to do the stupa to produce or manufacture in Java.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.960
 Java, the same, this stupa, but five, five stupas, and the middle one will be 20 feet,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.360
 and the four others are bigger than this stupa, which is 10 feet, no?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 12.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 12 feet.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 Plus the base 40.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 12 feet.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 20 feet.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 So five stupas are, really, we all kind of made a discussion back and forth with the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 men.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.000
 Laura and Elia and Elia, they've been discussing back and forth, back and forth with, in the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Java.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 In Java.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.760
 And finally, we met the contract, and we all come in the mutual agreement, contract, contract.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.480
 So now, as they really come, they're also excited, they wrote a letter today, today,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.020
 they said that they look at the calendar and the calculation, astrological chart, all that,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:49.120
 and tonight, our one o'clock, in the morning, they're going to start carving.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.760
 They said they look the calendar, they look the calculate, astrological chart, and they

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.200
 are really going to do, so please, you also think good things.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 They said, so that's, I was really, and we all made it, they said.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.600
 So tonight, mid-o'clock, when we were having a nice dream, dream, and that is what's happening.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.240
 So really, for that, they asked to do some prayer, also, I thought, we thought to really

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.200
 do prayer, so kind of, just really nice enough.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.080
 You see all that, and we do this short prayer, and dedicating this merit, and come every

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.360
 day, so perfectly in the performance, exactly as we, we should really come and to benefit

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.280
 to the world, peace, to every living beings, and to the Buddha teaching, and really spreading

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.040
 this North American become, and particularly also, Bhema Samyal become one of the very

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.920
 part of, like, very, what's called the powerhouse of the teaching of the Buddha Dharma.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.000
 For now, on, all the way to attract everyone in each enlightenment, really, really wish

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.280
 that, and as in Tibet, or in India, Nalanda Monastery University in Tibet, Samyam Monastery,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.320
 and later, all those great monasteries, really wish this, become one of the beautiful places,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.160
 there's so many realizations, so many great beings come one after the, who's so humble,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.880
 simple, don't doubt, yet so practical, keeping up the exactly core, and identity, identity

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.000
 in the principle of teaching of the Buddha Dharma, and the Gharipayama, some of us teaching,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 really wish that, and we may, we also have that realization, and by this merit, because

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.160
 we all am old, we all connected to this, so really wishing that from the core of our heart,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.440
 and we do this prayer, and I just thought to share that news, and do that, thought to do

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:55.080
 that, so if you have this, this, this, this, Bhej 27, as I say, which are, and so, we met

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.960
 the contract, and I think we had, what's called, we had the money to do the contract, that,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960
 and I think it will take what?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 A year and a half to two years.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.920
 One and a half, or two years, to finish that, so we met the contract, we had the money,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.680
 seed money, or to start that, and so now, we release, they're working on this, so that's,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.320
 that's my, really, announcement, and the news, and now, really, we wish all this, what, this,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.600

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.520
 so beautifully, it just came, came as a monument of the peace, and love, and devotion to the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.200
 Buddha Dharma Sangh, not struggling, and doing, it's kind of happening, this, it's just a kind

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.600
 of, naturally, it really came, and Samyam monastery in the Tibet, what is it called?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.560
 It's just Patanjalia complex, the great glorious monastery of the Tibet, that's what Samyam

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.520
 module, that's what's been named, in a way, this also really happened, it came very naturally,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.280
 and never thought this would come, never dreamed that, when we got this physical land, and,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.120
 and all of this, all of this happened, this truly is a blessings, blessings of the Buddha

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.320
