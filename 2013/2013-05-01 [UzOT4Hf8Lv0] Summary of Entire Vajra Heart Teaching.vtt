00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 Teacher, what are we going to do? What are we going to do in the kingdom? What do you learn? What

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.000
 are you going to practice this time?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 The first is, where we are going to practice, as I said, these four renormal sessions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Four renormal sessions, that means joy and appreciation. Love and kindness are comparable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Respect, bring up that four renormalization and attitude, realizations.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.730
 And the teaching said, said, in a short window, what is called? Unbelievable, productive, lama, you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.000
, norms.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 The strong devotion to the Muripam Mahasambhava was embodied in all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and all the masters, lineage, together with the lineage of the monsters, everyone, everyone.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.380
 A really strong person for that. Strongly, and with sincerely devotion, joy and appreciation,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.000
 connecting our heart and mind.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 May I become as a you all to benefit all certain beings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 With that sincerity, devotion, thought, and as I said many times, you already know that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 So, with that, then the joy and appreciation of our lives, and that is,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 the precious human body is difficult to obtain, that which now we want it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.540
 We have had eating that in humans, how lucky, how beautiful, happy in the joy, and appreciating

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.000
 that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 This appreciating the joy is not extra package, we are going to detour, detour from the practice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 That is practice. Practice, we are going to make the practice, we are not going to practice

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 suffering, sadness,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 difficulty, blame, criticizing, this and that. That is not practice.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Or at least there, but that for our, or how our, whatever we practice, that is not our practice.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Our practice is Jewish. We are going to touch with our inner core of the nature, of the new sins,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 call it that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.100
 We are going to touch with the Dharma, Sambukai, and we are going to touch with the Nirmaka Apollo

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.000
 of a new sin.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.670
 And there, the joy and appreciation breaks your life, and the favorable conviction is difficult to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000
 obtain, and unlucky, that I have that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.370
 I got that. I got that. It's not just that God was hurt on me, and accidentally, by causing

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 conviction, all this, thankful to everyone,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 to everyone who bought this life, dying and going to be afraid of things.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.650
 Then the second is the Reflei-Knoat, the impermanent. Everyone who is born to die, suffering is

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.000
 going to die, that's true.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 But that's the way, but we are not dying. I'm not dead now. I'm alive. I'm healthy, quite healthy.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I'm alive, I'm healthy, I'm jumping. I'm quite good. How lucky, how beautiful.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Beautiful. But he's born in it. It's true, everyone. Look back. How many things have changed?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Look now, and feel good. How many things have happened? And this is the same thing in the future.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 It's true.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 We're widening our understanding, not narrow. Widen understanding. We're not covering up that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 We're not covering up as a monkey star. Close our eyes, close our ears, and close our mouth.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It's the Dokki Masters, Dokki practice. We're fearless. We're going to look to that.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And that's called the Implei-Knoat. Then cause and conditions.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Conditions are inevitable. It's true. Extranity, everything is a cause and a contact inevitable.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And invert everything. Harpiness brings happiness. Invert the looking.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Sadness brings sadness. Anger brings anger. And that we know. Emotional level, we know.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 It's not just that Buddha said, master said. It's everything is corresponding. It's early.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Even it is illusion. Even it is unborn. Even it is all that great emptiness.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 But reality level, everything is cooperating relating that.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.750
 And therefore I have courage and commitment to determine that I'm going to make something beautiful

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.000
.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Good things. That will reflect good things to me now. And all of them are official.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And they're going to reflect to my friend and family and all the beings.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 They're going to do something. They can't have the courage and the detriment.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Knowing the secondary system of the cause and effort system. That system. That system.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Then in samsara, next thing, in samsara has so many trouble. That's called samsara.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Therefore, with that understanding, we have to be patient. We have to be courage.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Courage, ambition and acceptance. We have to accept the situation.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Passion, we do every best to avoid that. When it comes, we have to accept.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 There's no way we can avoid anything. It comes. It happens. It's happening. It will happen.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.540
 Right. It will happen. Therefore, courage and acceptance and patience and understanding is knowing

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.000
 the meaning of the samsara.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.180
 Samsara, with that increasing compassion, increasing love, increasing joy and opportunity, well, we

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.000
 are here in a nice time of the window of the nice time.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Why we spoil? Why we spoil? We have to be well, we are good.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.150
 And great master what? Great master, Pata Mahasadhi said, one of his teachers, Tungab Jata, he said

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.000
, the fire is around.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Everywhere, fire is around. Around, there's no way we can avoid. Avoid. It's true.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.720
 Everywhere is that. There's nothing that is this part of the samsara. However, there's the midst of

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.000
 the skylight, sunshine, sunshining.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Why we spoil that? We should be. Enjoy that sunshine. Do something good.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Happy, like happy, like happy others. Celebrate that. Enjoy that. That is the work of the practice.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And then with that, what is the next one? In the teaching of his own visual teaching.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 By thinking that may my mind turn to dharma. May my mind turn to dharma.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 That means dharma is not subject, dharma is not object, but dharma is our mind. Our mind.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.640
 We have to mingle to dharma, to our heart. Dharma is not the symbol to show, dharma is not the

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000
 title to show.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Dharma is not just a kind of regular things. Dharma is to the mind, dharma mingle with oneness.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 We and dharma, if we want to become one, then that's known as practice, great practice.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 For those reasons, what we challenge at the beginning of the phrase, look, choose your doors.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Chalamna doors, not trovat, trination, that phrase. My mind turns to dharma, become oneness.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.570
 That means when our mind turns to dharma, what will be happening? More happy, more joy, more

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.000
 peaceful, more calm,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.360
 more appreciative, soft heart, tender heart, heart, and full heart. That is really more happy, more

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.000
 content.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.260
 That is really known as dharma, dharma. In respect, we have all the beautiful qualities of the samb

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.000
okaya,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.620
 of the, you see, is arising, coming out, not covered by all those emotional packages that have been

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.000
 covered for so many lifetimes.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Now let's be enlightening. We're sharing that, we're sharing and coming, the real nuts coming out.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.380
 That is really the practice. Mind turns to dharma, something subtle, humble, performed, more

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.000
 satisfying, more joy.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.570
 With that, then refuge, confidence, with Buddha dharma sambokaya, with the devotees, compassion,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.000
 love and kindness,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 with all sentry, with the full wellness, and offering, sharing, all those, five steps of those,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 those, in devotion.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 All that is basic, our beautiful things, qualities of that.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 With that thought, then, let me practice it, zouki. With that, then practice zouki.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And zouki practice is what? And then the great master said at the beginning of time, take the time,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 time, we all have this nature, what a nature. You see, it's not, it's owned by the selected groups.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.750
 This master, Master Muharrami said, everyone has this, and everyone has not just have that,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.000
 everyone has equal.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Whether you're fully enlightened, whether we are deluded sentient beings, deluded sentient beings.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:52.920
 We all have the same nature without any disconnection. This nuxini is residing right in our heart

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.000
 center.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 That Muharrami said so many times in the quotation, he told quotation from the zouki teachings,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 teachings of all Tantras and Mahayoga, Anayoga, and as well as other, those renowned Tantras.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.390
 Here in Garbha and Gohya Samadhi, he told all those from quotation, that every once in one voice,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.000
 we all have this nature.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Nature is equal to everyone, is residing in the heart center. And how is residing that nature?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.750
 In the teachings, that's what he said, residing in the heart center with the clarity, with the

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.000
 emptiness, openness,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 openness, emptiness, clarity, that nature is residing all the time, right in our heart center.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.550
 And then in Gohya and Garbha, within the heart center, there are chakras, earth chakra, within the

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.000
 chakras.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Within the chakra, there is the natural states.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.480
 And then known as then, the ordinary, youthful, rest-body, which is enshilled by the dualities, but

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:17.000
 is residing full-growing, call it, full potential, full-growing, call it,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.070
 that's like nuclear enlightened scholars, residing light. And it has the openness, that means

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.000
 infinite. It is infinite.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 It's not can be measured. It's infinite. It's clarity, clarity of the five wisdom.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And five wisdom is not just the wisdom. Wisdom is what we think and tell it, but it's compassion.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 It's loving kindness.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.540
 Compassion, wisdom, ability that all reside in the form of light, the color, five colors, white,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.000
 yellow, red, blue, green,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 that which resides in indestructible nature within our natural states.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.840
 That is what we are moving towards, from light to light, from light to light. That is not the

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.000
 moving towards.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 That nature is residing right inside the center.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 That introduced, from what we introduced to us, that is right in our heart center.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.380
 And it stays with the three qualities as according to the Zokhi level. It stays the quality of the

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.000
 infinite,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 it stays the quality of the energy, it stays the quality of the manifestations,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 known as the old, inner, basic three wisdom of the kayaks.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.300
 Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya, that potential, that quality, full existing, right with that yuk

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.000
si quality.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 It's right. And that which is, then more will talk, that is not compounded.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Compounded because it's old inner quality is continued until now. It will continue in the future.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 It is not compounded. Every compounded it will subject to change.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Then it is not going to move. It is uncomported.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It is great permanent, in a way.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 In the teaching said, it is permanent of the great beyond of the permanent and impermanent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 The great permanent, which is beyond of the permanent, impermanent states.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And this nature states. It is to that being Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya is right with us.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 To behold that, then I vote. To behold this qualities,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 then I also vote some instructions of from the great master that I received.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And I learned from others. And then to just look to your nature, look to your mind.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 The looker itself is a consultant. That's what I want to say, a consultant.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 The moment you look, you reach to the speechless status.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 There's nothing to find. When you think I'm going to look by my mind, to my mind, by me.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 When you think of that, that is a consultant. That is mine.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 But beyond that, we can't explain anything.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Reach to the open states.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 That is, we are beholding the Dharmakaya call letter of the nuxi.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 That is Dharmakaya call letter of nuxi. And that is known as emptiness, the great emptiness.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 The great emptiness which is not blank emptiness.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 It's not blank emptiness. It's great emptiness.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's fullness. It's freedom. It's infinite.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It's Dharmakaya, the basic call of the inherent body or inherent that you behold.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Now you behold. That is will. That is will.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 This is what I also used and read quite extensively as other great teachings,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 teachings from the home I received.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And used as Garabdorti's technique. The introducing pointed out any nature as it is.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 That is what it is.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 When you got that introduced, when you discovered, there's nothing to behold.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And the teaching said, nothing to see is the greatest thing, sin.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 When you didn't see, that means the conception cannot play the role.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 You will reach to the inexpressible call of the nature, realization.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 That is, as I said, this is the will. Again I will say, that is known as will.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 I have to kill will and with practice of humanity. That is the will.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And will is so important. If we don't have the right will, what is our meditation?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Meditation is applying. What are we applying? Right, not right will.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Then what are we going to get? Result, not right result.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So therefore, right will is so important. Many great masters often use sin.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Say the kingdom will you say it? Say it many times.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 So it is a used example. If we mixed up the day post, then it will mix up other days too.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Day post is so important. First step, number one is important.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 If we mix up the number one, the rest of numbers goes wrong. That is just logic.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Therefore, once we got the will, that is important.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 This will is then known as the ordinary nature of the will.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 The sub-lubanistri, unimpeded realization of the Buddha, Samh, and the Buddha.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Realization of the Buddha, Kaptamuni, realization of the Gaurapayama, Samh.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 That will. That is realizing.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 When we are mingling our mind with that, being in that state,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 that is as I said the other day too.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 This is known as merging the mind, our mind with the mind of the great masters.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 That is what it is, merging that.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 It is not just a kind of treatment, a piece of objects coming together.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 But we are merging to the infinite state of that realization status.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That is this ordinary nature, ordinary qualities, unimpeded, abstract.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 From the beginning, one will recognize that qualities as we inherit it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 It is not something coming from outside.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 If we recognize that inheriting our qualities to ourselves,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 that is known as in the teaching more and more.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 It means you are natural, you discover as it is.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 You discover, you connect.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 And now, next one. To maintain that.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Then, tai chitot ji, then chitot ji goes up.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Apply to maintain that.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 That means you kept coming back to the womb.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Whether it is meditation, whether it is a contract,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 whatever experience go with through, go with through.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Coming back with nothing changed, nothing moved, nothing is happening.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 It is just a display, display, display, display.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 It is nothing is happening.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Nothing went out of the range.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 All is within that realm of the moral of the dharmakaya.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 The moral of the dharmakaya, what all is, the display of the dharmakaya,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 the display of the sambhokaya, nothing went out.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Nothing is wrong, we don't have to panic.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 We don't have to worry, we don't have to let all merge back as it can.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Within it is all natural state without bringing any other anti-dharmakaya outside or any means.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Use self-cleaning in a way.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Self-cleaning, sub-liberative.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Sub-liberative, right in there.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 That is not as meditation, that is the contract levels.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 When we are married, we are dead.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Then, as I said, there is a poor, poor, I mean, you know, you know, those poor ways to abide in.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Those are three immovable levels, which is jokhisa, his own style.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Jokhisa is one of the special states.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 So it triggers his own special techniques, those three techniques, immovable body,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 immovable of the senses, immovable of the mind, relaxed, abiding in the dharmakaya,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 freely, openly, very freshly, energetically and nicely, keeping up that.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 When we maintain that status, then those whole movements come.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 One after another, those movements come.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 I listed that, I went through those.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Those, at least the name, those things, that what the great master said.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 It's not something that I'm talking.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 But what the great master that I did, I learned, went through those.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 All comes.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 And that summarize of those, always in the teaching state.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Summarize all those experiences, you know, and there is rough experience and a smooth experience.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Rough experience, smooth embrace.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And that is first of all, as I spoke with you, abiding movement and behold.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 And when you're abiding this nature with all those qualities, and there is then experience comes.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And those are known as, to summarize that, rough experience and a smooth experience.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Rough experience is something that feels uncomfortable, uncomfortable.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Whether this land level or the sense level, or with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, whatever that level

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
, feeling level,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 and become kind of sensitive, editable, sensitive, sensitive,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 and all these things, some kind of unusual things, sparkly, physical level, mental level,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 all those things that really not feel right, feel uncomfortable.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Those are not rough experience.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Where this comes from, apply same thing.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Keep the will, let merge, let resolve.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Keep the courage and confidence, devotion.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Use all the compassion, love and kindness, compassion.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And bring up the realization, don't forget the instructions.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Don't forget the teachings.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Don't forget the practices.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Keep, re-stand on that and let it subside.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Let it go, let it dissolve.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Maintain and continue in the course of the worthwhile, as voyage.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Continue on that, it will subside.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Not just subside, but re-stand on the teachings, re-stand on our realization, our understanding.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Strongly and beautiful, deeply.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Those are rough experience.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Smooth experience, experience something appealing, that, that also comes.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Those times in the teachings said, come will come in three categories or more.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Those are known as the experience of the blessings, comfort levels.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 An experience of the clarity, kind of brilliant in them.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 An experience of the neutral states.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Those are the deva in the Tibetan.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Deva, sara, motobhaj.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And related with that to you.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.700
 Something not just always, that more kind of, everything going so nice and beautiful, nice,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.000
 environment level.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Inwardly also more kind of feeling senses of the bliss, senses of the clarity.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Something kind of brightness and senses of those neutral states.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Those also comes, those comes.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 But not, maybe not necessarily immediately when it's not in the meditation, it will come all that.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.100
 But maybe when we have little bit more abiding, this deva will become little stronger, little more

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.000
 stable, stable.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 And then you have become also little more noticeable, more subside.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 And then maybe those three experience, the smooth experience also begin to shine.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.860
 This is generally experience, in the teachings they are not, again, they are sign of the

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.000
 realization, sign of the progress.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Progress is a natural, basic, beautiful qualities are shining.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Bring up this, it's coming good.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 But however it is, also can be sometimes so drawn, our progress is by this.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 We start clinging, we start attached, we are kind of wanting that more.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 That means we are trying to track our meditative by the ego, by the desire where we want.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Because our meditative, zuki meditative, free from the ego, free from the grasping.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.790
 But if we start grasping, manipulating by grasping in our own happy dependence, then it could turn

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:30.000
 into some kind of slow, handless, handless dance.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Otherwise, the bliss itself is the quality of the dap, the sambogai.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Yeah, no, bliss is the quality of the narmakai.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 And clarity, that brightness is the quality of the sambogai.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And the neutral is the quality of the darmakai.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 It's arising, arising.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 That is natural expression called as radiating.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 But if we start grasping, clinging, then it can be that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So there, again, whenever that comes, it comes as the great Master Father, when you say it,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 but using instantly, instantly, maintaining in the rupa status, on that rupa status,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 and using instantly, instantly, or suddenly, using syllables such as pek, pek.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 If you are alone meditating, your own room, room, and then use that pek.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Start shouting, the pek, pek.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 One time, we had the teaching, we came with this teaching, long time ago, to go,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 and then this, in the pattern was teaching.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.570
 So some day, the three word, the three word that point out, that has, can we then give it, so we

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.000
 give it that.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 And then there is this, this, use this pek service.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 So then we are meditating, up and on, up and on, up and on, everybody meditating,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 and somebody shooting, somebody kind of so suddenly, suddenly,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 and finally took over, jumped up, jumped up.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So, this is how we grew together, I think it could be, again, it's not that,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 it's really kind of like, it blows up, blow.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 But as an individual, when you meditate, and you have this experience,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 or you need this rough experience too, to use rough experience, those comes too,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 then use this techniques, just immediately kind of shatter away that space,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 and relax on the person's step, listen and focus, meditate again, and that will help.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 So that's it. So those are the way to practice.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So with practices, and then, that is the way to practice.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Again, start with very beautiful foundation practices,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 and then do every, and do the documentation.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 As we went through, it's good to do documentation, for 15 minutes, or 5 minutes, 10 minutes,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 whatever you can do, do every day, if you didn't do that, practice it, it will be wonderful.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 It's beautiful, and then, in the concluding, that, then, delegate the merit, merit,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 and that, and, and in the concluding, do all those beautiful dedication prayers,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 and then we need to come to the post-meditation.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Then, also, if you can kind of remember this one, this one in the teachings,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 you said, "I has joined, every time I have done practices, what I have done,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.740
 Karma, rabra, manme, te, yuma, sepa, chor, te, manalo, te kita, nudhi, chun, te, te, te, te, te, te

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.000
, te, te, te, te of the Buddha.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 And in the honest way, they used to challenge this.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Every session, particularly summer retreat, they need to do this practice of the challenge.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Every time you go out, they challenge them.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 And this is the same thing here, here.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 This is the same thing here, here and here, in very nice books of His grace.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 This is all these phenomena, books of diyala, magy, variety, dream, recollection,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 that hallucinatory city of the Gandharva, echoes, reflection of the moon in the water,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 bubble, optical illusion, and manifestation, manifestation illusions.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 We should know, should know, you should know, all world phenomena should be just these 10 examples

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 of the illusions.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 So this is the post-meditational level, and we try to perceive that.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.980
 Or just if we don't think about all those things, just all this dream, all this magic, all this

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.000
 variety, is truly it is.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 It's a magic. It's like a mirage. It's really, exactly.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.540
 And as this. It's not just that we have trained that sort of object like that, all this. But our

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.000
 self, my self is a dreamer.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 My self is illusion. My self is mirage. So everything is this status.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And have that attitude a little bit as much as we can.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 That is also really the beginning of the dreamy of our practice, too.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 We started thinking that, again, it's true. It is mirage. Isn't it?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Really, we start thinking that is a very, very big step of the dreamy of our practices, practices.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 And they're dedicated to merit. So that's it. And that is my, in a way, brickstroke.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And now, what do you learn? Now, doki meditation, and look into the nature of the mind.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Relax. Relax. And that's it. And as the God of God is teaching.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So remember that, and thank you, everyone.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Great. Any questions?
