00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.510
 Purity is very important. And the purity is again what that means. Purity means this again as we

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.900
 said yesterday or as I said yesterday and you, we did this moment to you, this all start this

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 visualization from great wisdom and compassion.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.680
 So now what we visualize all this very powerful meditation of the White Umbrella is it should be

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 meditation on the wisdom and compassion, the United Truth.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.290
 So it is all compassion. It is all wisdom. And that means also transcendental wisdom as a rainbow

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.000
 body. It is wisdom.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.520
 And then of course like all those different things like three eyes and also for that those are

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 different symbols.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Those are the way to usher us to the purity status. But deep down we should just simplify it is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.270
 this meditation is compassion, this meditation is wisdom, this meditation is beyond the duality and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.000
 the restructures.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 This is what it is. And therefore bring that purity in the status. Then second the thought is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.000
 stable. Stable is very very again important.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And that means there is two stables. Stable of our concentrations and stable of our confidence.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.930
 Confidence is important because we are not going to think I cannot be this, I am not that or I am

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 pretending this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 This is not stable. This means our confidence is weak. We are going to embrace this as it is.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.330
 It is our true being. True Buddha nature is manifested in the white umbrella. And now she is. I am

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.000
 she. I am truly she.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Absolutely she. And I am that God. Have that confidence.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.140
 This confidence what in the teaching said in the very energy is called regular pride. This is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 regular pride. This pride is not good.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.890
 Always teach. This is one of the negative emotions in pride. But this is very important because we

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
 are making true statement what we are truly true.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.150
 Our Buddha nature we are more bring to the Buddhist status. Therefore we should that is a regular

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.000
 pride. And that is confidence.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.650
 We have to keep maintain that. And we have that confidence that the regular pride with the purity

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.000
 understand that combined together.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.540
 Even our visualization is not so place or bright or that. Then the result manifest result will come

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.000
. And that's what all masters say.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 In great you realize that the concentration will become clear to you. And therefore this meditation

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.000
 is so special.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.260
 Virtualization is union of the meditator of skillful means and the person of mind. Or compassion of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.000
 the person of trouble is so spare.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.090
 And therefore immediately we are connecting through the origin of our inheritance call address

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 without interfering by the dualities or the negativities.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 We are right in the center. Center of that state. And that is very very important.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And this is again with that meditation every recited mantra.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Then recited mantra is then our transforming our speech into the regular speech into her speech.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.170
 So I will now transform our body into her body state or origin our natural state or not just say

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.000
 here actually in here also.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 You see this I think maybe I could highlight here. Here in very three years the moment I recollect

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.000
 it into the primordial in several wisdom in the Samaya beings.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 That means there is no two separate meditators and what do you meditate. You are in that state.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 That's it. You are in that state.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.990
 To embrace that therefore as I say now we need confidence. We need the vagabaritis. We shouldn't

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.000
 feel that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.650
 If we have that confidence then negativities all those transcendent all those obscuring what to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.000
 talk then it just become almost what's called piece of cake.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.170
 All become physical cakes. It's yummy. It's yummy. It is glorifying the power and the dignity and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.000
 the majesty of me.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.830
 It is all. It's just all added. As there is big fire burning no matter how much you put or whatever

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.000
.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.480
 It's kind of it makes more fire. That's what is similar to this. And with that I understand it and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.000
 the recited mantra.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Recited mantra starts forming our speech as has speech.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.340
 Speech has speech. It's true speech. And a Western speech. Compaqing speech. And that will dispel

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.000
 all the then obscurations, obstacles, hindrance and the force of speech on truth.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And then the move over. And this is the most powerful again. Speech is generally more powerful.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Speech is connected with talent to the wind. That's why again I take you over and say when you

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 receive the empowerment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 All this speech empowerment remove the wind obscurations.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.890
 Wind is more stronger than this tangible mass thing. Of course we are more kind of connected with

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.000
 these forms.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 But wind is so powerful and the speech is so powerful it goes subtle.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 There is semi, semi, semi visible or semi invisible states. Therefore it goes deeper, deeper.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And they were transcendenting all the song and the speech as has speech.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 And recited this mantra as much as you have time. Then I bring to you this mantra.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Mantra. Then here. Here they didn't have exactly the hard one.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Which is the completing stages of Zokki meditation. Going right to the R status.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And they didn't really have the practice because the center is short.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 But the Grand Master Chiang Moo Moo said here.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Said here, here this is what it is.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Said in this colorful here. This is after the Chiang Moo mantra.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 After this, this is very important. And so now we practice it on her body, her speech.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Now we have to highlight about her worst mind.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.830
 And her worst mind is then here. Again it's as I said, it's going back to the us level as all this

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.000
 meditation begins.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And this is after this practice look to my own mind.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Clearly, calmly, turn inward. There is nothing to see. Even though.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Yeah, this is inward. After this very practices look to your own mind.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Clearly, calmly, turn inwardly. There is nothing to see.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 See, and that is roughly translations.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Then the meditator after that, meditator look directly to your one's own mind.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Directly, there is nothing to see.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Abiding that state clearly or brilliantly. Abiding that state brilliantly.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 That is, then we are highlighting to her worst mind of the white amarena.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.700
 And then meditator, that is joking meditator. Relax. This is very, in the Tibet, it's really

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.000
 beautiful.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 When you meditate, if you can think of this world, and then just relax.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And that's it again, as I said before. This assures us to back to that crucial level.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Exhiling that level. And relax. There is nothing to make effort now.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Nothing to make go over and over again. Yes, everything is in that state.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And it relax. And it rest. And that is the absolute state of the white mother amarena.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 This is known as then, actualizing her warrior mind.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 So her warrior body, her warrior speech, and her warrior mind. Now we complete it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And that is the principle practices. That is the central practice.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 All the, as I said, there's three frames, three volumes.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 The first one is the raffled in bodhicata with devotion, prayers, and joy, appreciation.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And the middle one is then this practice acts. And then that we complete.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Now the third volume is the dedication in aspirating prayers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And we practice this with joy, with bodhicata, with good intention.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Now we are going to also conclude, finish and touch this with beautiful intention as we start it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And that is known as the dedication prayers. Dedicating.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Dedicating is the statement of the good heart.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 With job and kindness and compassion, we can best to all the beings by my practice, by my effort,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 and to me.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And then also aspiration by this. May I fulfill all the good bodhicata activities.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 All every good bodhicata activities. Every don't know.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 And where the magicki and some of the other bodhisattvas fulfill their bodhicata aspiration.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.170
 And as they are working, as they are praying, I am joining with them that I like to be fulfilled

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.000
 the same way I like to do the same way as.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 All great master shanti devas and great master papa rumba ji or chanmi rumba ji.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 All those great master, their aspirations, their activities, their intentions.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 May I be fulfilled the same way and may I benefit them to solve all the things.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.360
 From now, until everyone reach the enlightenment, long-lasting aspiration prayer and dedicated

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.000
 prayer is the way to end our practice in the teaching of the Buddhas.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 That session, end of the session, that's how we end it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.010
 And that we completed perfectly, started perfectly, and practiced perfectly, and concluded

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.000
 perfectly.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And then everything is really good.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 With that intention, that thought, and then carried to the world.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.050
 And of course, again, in the beginning of time, our practitioners, ourself, which is due to the

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.000
 power of the emotions, there is always an up and a down.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.380
 But always trying to regain the mindfulness and our practices and then just really trying to move

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.000
 forward.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 And ex-choose, forgive, passion, joy. Are we able to do those things? That is practice.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 It's not something that we are doing extra beside the practice.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 If we forgive, we ex-choose, we acknowledge, we say sorry.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 All those ways, we are fulfilling our bodhicitta things.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.170
 And open heart, open mind, and move forward, keep the courage and commitment, and keep our

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.000
 principles.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Principle, the practices. And that is the way the practitioner should be.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And that is the legacy of all those great masters that we know.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 No, so that's how we conclude the practices.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Thank you. Thank you.
