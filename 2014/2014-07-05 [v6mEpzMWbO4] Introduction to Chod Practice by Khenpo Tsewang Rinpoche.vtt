00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.220
 This is what you do the few practices, and this is those instrumentals, teaching and instruction is

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.980
 mentioned.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 When you look to this text, the bellowing laugh of the Dakini, said here in English, "I posted it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.120
 to the queen of the spirits, very of the great bliss."

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 In this text, the true nature of the great practitioner, the great perfectionist, the true nature,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 the great perfectionist.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 Then that means the practicing of the Dzogchen, there is nothing more practicing than the Dzogchen.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.120
 Dzogchen is the absolute true practices.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:17.570
 Because it's transcendent, it removes instantly, culturally all the publication of the duality that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.120
 is created. Everything is instantly released and liberated in the absolute state of the Dzogchen.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.620
 So there is nothing higher, better, more technical, more powerful, more easy than the practice of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.120
 the Dzogchen.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.470
 However, those who were here in the teaching said here, "Samsara, one has one struggle," Dzogchen

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.930
 practiced him, "they don't have anything above the top and the face, all is released in the one

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.120
 that stays."

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.840
 And for that state, there is everything transcendent, there is no cutter, and that cuts, subject

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.120
 and object and activities, all that transcendent.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.000
 But however, for those who enjoyed the elaboration, a complicated part of the crazy personal

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 activities, crazy personal activities, I will teach the peace instruction for us offering one's own

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.120
 body as food.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.950
 This is the, particularly of course, practice of the inner dandara, and then particularly also this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.120
 is practice done by Pozum, in Bodhachyakya Manish, Vinaya.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.800
 We're working for enlightenment. As I said this morning, and you know that we need to develop the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.120
 thought of enlightenment, bodhijata in heart, heart, and when that reflected, that great bodhijata,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 we can go to each other,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.200
 we can combine together as all boneless, boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy, and bon

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.120
eless equanimity.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.390
 Once that sizzling in the heart, without any shaking by the doubt and hesitation and discouragement

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.390
 and disappointment, keeping up that strongly and then reflecting that into the six paramatas or the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.120
 ten paramatas.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 And the first paramata is generous practices. Generous practices have bigger, small, and mediums.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 All generous being known as also generous of the wealth, generous of the material, generous of the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.120
 world, the wisdom of the teaching, and generous of the protections.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.430
 Those are the measures. Among the generous of the substances, the material, there is a small,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.120
 medium, and a bigger.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.510
 The biggest one is distributing one's own body, not just the wealth in that, but one's own precious

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.120
 body for the sake of the sentient beings, the sake of others to help them.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:05.810
 In the life story of the Buddha's city, there are so many of those. Buddha gave his own body to the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.120
 hungry travelers with the five cups, the cups he gave up there.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 There is one after another, many, many beautiful stories that how Buddha gave up.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.320
 Every time he did such a great commitment, sorry, of course a commitment, but with a statement. As

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.120
 I gave this to my body to remove the hunger or thirst or whatever the trouble they are facing,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.560
 as when I made this, I reached the enlightenment to say, "Oh, living beings, when I reach the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.120
 enlightenment, may I ever share my personal wisdom, realization to this purpose."

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.770
 So, they can also get absolutely enlightenment status with this. So, Buddha said that, so this is

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.120
 again in generally, but generally in Mahayana practitioners, that those who have capabilities.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.650
 Then, particularly, in the Mahayana teaching, is most skillful means as I said this morning. Skill

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.120
ful means is then, is not necessarily you giving literally your body, but mentally you are giving.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.300
 Giving your own body or as I said place as food. And those are the teaching then in all is

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.120
 explained in after work here.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.020
 After, so these are the old and you just put it in those are the then, like a white offering, red

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.120
 offering, striped offering and black offerings or the dark offering and so forth.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.410
 Poor great priest. This is the priest. It's just not just only the food priest, but a variety of

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.120
 quality, every desire, every object of desire that really you distribute it.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.780
 And visualize each of those on meditate and expanding that, that realization without any doubt and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.120
 hesitation to all the invisible beings, all the invisible beings, this is.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.500
 With mentally you distribute in this. So, that's it. In order to do this, then in here, in the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.280
 teaching said work here, said this, that also to kind of activate in that, to glorify that, to

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.120
 remind of that realization

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.030
 as crazy, versatile activity. That means you're maintaining the perfectly versatile, perfectly

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.120
 versatile state as I said last night.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.170
 Maintaining as the regular samadhi of the exotic will as it is, regular will. And keeping up the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.120
 will as with the medical display of the meditate.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.200
 And that is supported by the warrior-like, warrior-like, like as conduct. Without a doubt and

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.350
 hesitation, absent you don't, continually keeping the conduct, morality in the God and the Samaya,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.120
 exactly keeping up matter with that.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.320
 Through that, then we actualize the realization absolutely. So here, in order to do this, then

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:59.120
 articles you need to do these are the overpowered arrogance, the wild animals' skin and so forth.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.950
 Those are these days, generally, not necessary you have to get. These days it is, if you want to

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:14.110
 get lot of what's called this name, the pubrics. You can get nice pubrics, those tiger-skin looking

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120
.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:23.200
 Really, tiger-skin looking, leopard-skin looking and those. And then you can go to those Halloween

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.120
 big stores and go to good things.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.120
 Good things are what you want.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.450
 That is the drill, that we are win-win situations. You also play a hollow game, but at the same

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:49.050
 time, we have other meanings. So that is known as the crazy-whisper activity. Something subtle, but

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.120
 rather crazy.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:08:00.090
 So that's animal skin and the claw, intact, all that. So then, we are together with these, also

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:06.180
 those yogis, yogi, the practitioners, when they are ready, it's not that everybody at your practice

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.120
 have to go this, different, this.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120
 It's like that?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.120
 No, it's okay, no. Over to you. This one, right?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.120
 Over to you, this pain.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:33.930
 Okay, so anyway, those who want ready to go, that means the first step, to go to those, like I said

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.740
, in the teaching, say those important sensitive locations in the teaching, when you go to sensitive

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.120
 locations, that means, according to the Buddha teaching,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.040
 there are so many beings that you all know. I mean, we've heard this so many times. There are six

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.120
 beings, class of beings.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:57.620
 Hellarim beings, beings of hellarims, beings of the hungry ghosts, beings of the animals, beings of

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.120
 the human beings as we are, and beings of the asura, beings of the gods.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.120
 There are six class of beings.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.120
 And within this, there's also, this category can be divided into two sections.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.120
 So, visible beings, invisible beings, invisible beings.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:23.470
 This is particularly designed and activating your practice, your realization through the power and

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:30.120
 energy and density to activities of the invisible beings.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.000
 That you activate it and therefore they affect whatever you feel through the body, through this

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.120
 verbal, or through the wind, through the air, through mental.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.920
 You're going to maintain unshakeable, valuable, medical and meditation, warrior-like conduct of the

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:54.120
 morality, never shake it, never even move it, maintain that.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.770
 As the Buddha did, for example, of course, the Buddha was already in high states, but the Buddha

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.120
 sat there under the body tree.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.120
 When he met it, he committed that he's going to reach enlightenment, met that statement, met that,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 and at that moment, what did he consider?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:20.120
 Eighty millions, Mars came, began to attack, began to have stuck. What did Buddha say?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:30.040
 Whether art is Christ, or whether art is completely tumbles and I fall down, or my bone is

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:37.120
 completely skin and flesh, completely dry up the sun and heat,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:46.540
 or I was completely held on my bones, but I'm never going to move from one sentimental, from this

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.120
 Christian, or from this grass Christian.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.120
 Without obtaining my goal of the final enlightenment.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120
 When he met that statement, the art started shaking, the art started tumbling.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:05.120
 At the same time, eighty thousand millions, or eighty millions, Mars began to attack.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.120
 When that happened, what Buddha did? Never thought, any moved, anything.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:23.120
 He meditated on loving kindness, kind love. May every living being have great happiness and joy,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.120
 and cause of the happiness and the joy.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.120
 He never moved, slightly from that meditation and relaxed.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.170
 And all those obstacles are maras that wrap, or can wrap those experiences, or the visions, are

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.120
 completely subsided, ascended, and pacified.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:49.120
 Right there, over the moment, Lord was sudoku, what's called sudoku? Lord was sudoku, okay, arising

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.120
.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:56.560
 All one, up another, again, another displaced mara appeared in sudoku, very gentle, very appealing

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.120
 way, in a way.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.230
 Epic never moved from that, never moved once, continued meditating on the loving kindness, and

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.120
 great zoki status.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:18.120
 Status. So that is what is known as vedal and uncheckable, vedal samadhi, samadhis.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:25.020
 So this practitioners would perform this, not just doing this, kind of that, but really trying to

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:32.600
 bring up that realization, trying to make that strong and firm and uncheckable, combined with love

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.120
 and compassion.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:41.080
 As I said last night, Buddha's teaching, Lord said, having the realization of the great emptiness,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:47.120
 and never give up every living being from the compassion, and combine together.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:53.850
 All the skills made in wisdom combined together, and that will, uncheckable, and that is also not

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.120
 substantial, solid, existing as things.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.120
 It is the magic of discipline, it is dreams of discipline, discipline.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:11.260
 Bring that realization vividly, and maintain all the necessary things without discoloring it, or

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.120
 without kind of going easy way or something.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:21.770
 It's okay or something is with that, and following the laziness, keeping up the conduct as warriors

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.120
.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.120
 Warriors means, that means what? Warriors, when they came to the battlefield, they are going to

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.120
 defend, defend themselves, they are going to overrun to the opponents.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:41.310
 What is the opponent at this time? It's for those demons. For demons, we have to overrun and

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.120
 overpower them.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:50.120
 That is the principle view, philosophy of, or essential view of the two practices, two practices.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.980
 So, in order to bring that realization, understanding, and hear, hear what is it, again in a prayer

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.120
, three.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.120
 Three, to symbolize the descendant view, the small tense.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.070
 That means those who are going to those sensitive locations, such as cemeteries, or some days in

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.120
 the lonely, younger place, desert, scary places going there.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.720
 So you have to have some preparation, not just going there, but because you have to take care of

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.120
 your body, too, in a relative level.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.550
 Even though you are going to distribute this to the world, in a reservation, but relative in human

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.120
 level, we are going to take care of our body, because our body is so precious.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.620
 In Mahayana taking brotherhood, he said, "It's a vehicle, it's like water to cross the ocean, cross

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.120
 the river, cross the sea."

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:45.160
 Without this body, nothing can be achieved. So therefore, we have to keep this boat, we have to

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:52.120
 keep this kayak, this kayak, because we like to kayak for a long time.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:15:09.440
 Without this kayak, we are not going to explore any adventures, that's for sure. So therefore, we

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.120
 have to keep this bit work kayak.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:17.370
 So therefore, when we are going to get the rain or the snow or whatever, we have to have a nice

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.120
 tent.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:25.130
 And tents are very easy, of course, in a little bit, it's difficult to make all those things, you

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.120
 have to make big effort.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.670
 But these days, very easy, I mean, the modern country, highly developed, rich country, there are so

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.120
 many beautiful tents.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:43.120
 So this is what it means here, this is the same vu, a small tent.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:51.320
 That means, that also shows that symbolize, this is not just a tent, but our vu, your vu, your z

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.120
oking vu.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:16:01.670
 Zoking vu is word of the garudas, or word of the bird's vu. It's vu, everything sees, nothing is

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:08.120
 blocked by the narrow regimen, any conceptions of jungles or the valleys, anything.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.120
 These birds are vu's, everything is seen.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:20.120
 The old, like I used to use the example, 360 angles, completely vision, that is the vu.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:26.780
 Open vu, that is in the teaching said, that's the Murugan Masambha said in the teaching, the open v

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.120
u.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.910
 Most of the panoramic vu, never will be blocked, every vu block in the vu, limited vu, that means

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.120
 narrow mind.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.120
 Then everything becomes so tight and so dense, and comfort like everything clashing to each other.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.640
 When you have the big room, in the open heart, what does it mean, also the rest, in here, like open

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.120
 heart, open heart, open mind, in the open status.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.460
 There is many things, there is many rooms, birds are flying in the open sky, airplanes are flying

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:07.120
 in the open sky, helicopters are flying in the open sky, and there is many things happening.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.120
 Sky never see it, it's crowded or anything, it's open.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.120
 That is like mind, that is mind, and we keep that.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.830
 Then everything can be accepted, everything can come, everything can move and everything is just

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.120
 partly to keep.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:33.120
 That is symbolized by this 10, not just only protection for our physical level.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:42.710
 And then here in the same way, ascending, ascending conduct, conduct level, we should not, vu is

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.120
 vast and limitless, but conduct should be very poor.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.920
 The warrior-like conduct, as already I said, and the teaching said, I mean it's not just I'm saying

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.120
, but teaching said, warrior-like conduct.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.120
 Warriors in the battlefield are going to pay every attentions, every thought, not going to the

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.120
 council or don't care, not pay attention.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:15.120
 Everything is taken care of to defend, to secure his friend or whatever those immoral or their

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.120
 friends, to secure in every defend, thoroughly, portable, everything.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:29.120
 So not ignoring the conduct level, have to be portable, have to be precise, have to be detailed,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.120
 detailed as mundane levels.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.660
 What is good should do the good things. What is bad in the mundane world or the union world? What

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.120
 is that bad?

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.120
 Don't do it. And then obey the laws, all those rules, regulations.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:51.120
 And then of course, obey laws, and laws, and our uncle will be very happy.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.120
 That's right. Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam will be very, very happy.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:05.120
 You will be the best nephew or best niece. So therefore, thank us.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.990
 And thank us. Our Buddha teaching has beautiful rules, guidelines, to improve and to glorify our

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.120
 Buddha nature.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.120
 Love and compassion, our practice, to wrap nothing.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.120
 Conduct is always what the teaching said that will boost of the realization.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:27.750
 Conduct is good conduct, is really, like medical groups. It really will boost of your realization,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.120
 your understanding.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.120
 Not just only the meditation rules, but good conduct.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.120
 And we don't really have the good conduct and morality as in the teaching said.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:42.440
 It will then undermine. We fill in a ditch. Ditch. And then we can't get our easy kind of fill in

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.120
 ditch.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:50.540
 We can't get up there. In the winter times, when we dry, some kind of dirt roads, there's ice and

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.120
 snows.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.120
 And we have to put on a carefully dry. And we fill in a ditch.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.120
 And then you know how much tubbles you have to get up from the ditch.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.120
 And you have to call it eh eh, you know.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.120
 And all this, and even though they will come, but then it is cold, and it's windy, and ice.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.120
 And they said, I mean, this is the tub of really good conduct.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.120
 Therefore, the conduct is really true of what the Buddha said.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.120
 But for example, Buddha, how made the conduct?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:26.120
 Even his total enlightenment, everything that, to throw to the ice, that.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.120
 And then Guru Maasam. Guru Maasam alone creates a verse of activity.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:36.120
 But he is showing how the old everything is flexible, how things can be like, to his illusion.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.120
 That is what the Guru Maasam's activity proved to us.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.120
 Old is illusion. There is no regimen. Solid things can be transformed.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.120
 Fire can be transformed in the water. Water can be transformed in the fire.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.120
 So that means changing the molecules, changing the oxygens.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.120
 Or those, what do they call them? In the western, those are, otonin.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.120
 Neutron.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.120
 What?

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.120
 Proton. Neutron. Yeah, proton. Those, they are changing.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.120
 Instead of that, changing. That is what really means.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.120
 Changing. This can be changed. This is easy.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.120
 You say, when you have the realizations, that is not going to be one of the muslims.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.120
 Then, for example, all these great teachers that we met, we spoke.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.120
 How they are humble. How they are simple. How they stay remaining in the total.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:32.120
 Not just kind of doing, using their kind of power or their kind of title.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.120
 Just jump at all these things. They are so tall, so humble, so simple.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.120
 So kind of like, very, very humility.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.120
 Emulations. Emulations. Those are known as good kundra.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.120
 Good examples.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.120
 So this is what, to symbolize that kundra is that katangas.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.120
 Then, to have the authority over the demons and the Thai bones.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.120
 That means, to overpower the demons.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.120
 Demons, in this case, also means, those are invisible.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.120
 It could be obstacle, the man-handedness.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.120
 But at the same time, demons are there for demons, as I listed.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.120
 To overpower, to subdue us and those, and the Thai bone too bitters.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.120
 Then, to dominate the whole of the dakinis.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.120
 And that means, all of the dakinis, to please and to come in your mind to that.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.120
 To come to your magnetize of that to break.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.120
 And then this bell and the jangli bell is there.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:37.120
 And the tassels, which use up, take a second, what else now?

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.120
 Take the bell, tassels.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.120
 Yeah, tassels and all those things.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.120
 To then, to bring magnetize or to bring all the nakinis there.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.120
 So those are the principle things.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.120
 And among this, among this, then this is like the overpowered appearance of the dhammaru.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.120
 That means, overpowered appearance means, your realization,

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:05.120
 your understanding of the true nature, exactly as you have as the Vedas and the Madhi movies.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.120
 And then, everything is overpowered.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.120
 Overpowered is all the perceptions.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.120
 The perception of the eyes, the perception of the ears.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.120
 As I said last night, the perception of the nose, the perception of the tongue,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.120
 the own perception of the body, the perception of the mind.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.120
 All the overpowered is your power.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.120
 Most of the time, we human beings cannot control our perceptions.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.120
 We can completely become wired by our own perceptions.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.120
 This great Master, this great realization,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.120
 we have that as keeping the samadhi, Vedas samadhi vu,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.120
 Vedas samadhi vu, medit, meditation,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.120
 and the world, like conduct, they can overpower.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.120
 Whoever has that, it's not just a selected guru providing own by that,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.120
 but anyone who has realized that, our power.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.120
 Our power, all of these things, all of these things.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.120
 It's not our power or something.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.120
 Others are you, our power, your own, our own.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.120
 This perception, all those categories.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.120
 And all can be summarized as one's perceptions, our own powers.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.120
 When you overpower that perception, then truly we become the yogi and yoginis.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.120
 Because your samadhi is good and your meditation is good,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.120
 your conduct is good, that is known as sky-like yogi and yoginis.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120
 And those are known.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:43.120
 So among this all, all, and then this dhammaru is the, the,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.120
 that is overpowering. So this is what.
