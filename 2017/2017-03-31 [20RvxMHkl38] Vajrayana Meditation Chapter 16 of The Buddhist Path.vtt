Among the vehicles taught by the Buddha, both the Mahayana and the Vajrayana lead to enlightenment; the main difference is that the Mahayana is a more gradual path, whereas the Vajrayana directly reveals the nature of the mind. Vajrayana meditation practice does this in two main ways: through creation stage practice and completion stage practice.\n The creation stage uses visualizations to reveal that the universe, both internal and external, is pure light. In order to display the self-existing primordial wisdom, we have to transform old habits of perceiving whatever we see, hear, and touch as being solid and truly existent. In creation stage practice, we visualize a pure land containing pure deities and enlightened beings such as Vajrasattva or Guru Padmasambhava. When we meditate on the body of the deity, we perceive our own body transformed into a pure, absolute body, and we see that all sentient beings, ourselves and others, are pure and primordially enlightened. The visualization practices display the pure nature of reality. It is because of our mind's habitual ways of discriminating between things that we create a static world that is actually unreal.

In all these practices, we hold, visualize, and concentrate on something. In the completion stage without characteristics, we don't concentrate on anything but simply rest in the fresh, present state and behold the panoramic view of outer and inner phenomena without any boundaries.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 Hello, this is the 16th PBC Morning Dawn webcast from Padmasamyaling, the Venerable Kemperimiches G

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.000
ompa, in New York.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.270
 So today we'll be discussing from their book, The Buddhist Path, Chapter 16, called Vajrayana

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.000
 Meditation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 Thanks so much for joining us, and then we'll do our usual opening prayers, and then have the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.000
 discussion. Thank you.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 (Sadhguru chants)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 (Sadhguru chants)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 (Sadhguru chants)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 This supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential extraordinary

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 view and doctrine of the early translation school,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.270
 you keep alive and spread by the light of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great temple, I pray at your Lord

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.000
's feet.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 In the palace of the old man Dhamma Daptu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 the one who shows clearly the dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honourable Rupkuru,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 glorious fruit-teacher, precious one, dwelling on the lowest seat in the crown of my head,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 follow me with your great kindness, and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 (Sadhguru chants)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 Thanks. So again we're in Chapter 16 called Vajrayana Meditation in the Buddhist Path, and it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.000
 begins on page 79,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.190
 and then we'll give a brief summary of the first half of the chapter, and then we'll go into our

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.000
 discussion.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So the Venerable Kevirama Chas begin by saying that Vajrayana meditation techniques

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.300
 enable us to let go of our limited ideas about reality and experience what is beyond the five

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.000
 senses.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 If we perceive something through our five senses, we believe it exists.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 If we don't experience it directly through our senses, we think it is not there.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We mostly believe in what we see and hear. But how reliable are our five senses?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Do we perceive everything that is happening?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 According to Vajrayana, there's a lot we don't perceive with our limited dualistic perception.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.200
 For example, we can see far beyond our present moments and sense impressions into the past and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.000
 future.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Great enlightened masters like Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 experienced reality without duality mistakes. By directly realizing the emptiness of all phenomena,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 they could experience phenomena accurately throughout all time and space

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 and perform amazing activities like leaving handprints and solid rock.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 The Mahayana and Vajrayana vehicles taught by the Buddha both lead to enlightenment,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 but the principal difference is that Vajrayana does this much more quickly

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 by directly revealing the nature of the mind.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 In Vajrayana, there are two main practices, the creation stage visualization

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 and the completion stage dissolution.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Creation stage emphasizes the pure nature of all forms and sounds

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 by using visualization and mantra recitation,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 while completion stage emphasizes pure mind

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 by directly recognizing and relaxing into the nature of the mind

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 beyond all conceptions and dualistic fabrications.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 So then we'll go into the first main topic.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 This comes from page 79, the second fourth paragraph,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 as well as page 81, the first full paragraph.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 According to the Vajrayana tradition, things can be known without being seen or heard.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 For example, by doing Vipassana practice, one gains insight that enables you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 to see things never previously imagined.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Our mental ability goes far beyond our current sense perceptions and thoughts.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 To reach enlightenment, it is necessary to go beyond our limited ideas

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 and discover the wisdom nature.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Among the vehicles taught by the Buddha,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 both the Mahayana and the Vajrayana lead to enlightenment.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 The main difference is that the Mahayana is a more gradual path,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 whereas the Vajrayana directly reveals the nature of Mahayana.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Vajrayana meditation practice does this in two main ways,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 through creation stage practice and completion stage practice.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The creation stage uses visualizations to reveal that the universe,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 both internal and external, is pure light.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 In order to display the self-existing primordial wisdom,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 we have to transform old habits of perceiving whatever we see here

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and touch as being solid and truly existent.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 In creation stage practice,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 we visualize a pure land containing pure deities and enlightened beings,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 such as Vajrasattva or Guru Pama Samabha.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 When we meditate on the body of the deity,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 we perceive our own body transformed into a pure, absolute body,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 and we see that all sentient beings, ourselves and others,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 are pure and primordial enlightenment.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 The visualization practices display the pure nature of reality.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 It is because of our mind's habitual ways of discriminating between things

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 that we create a static world that is actually unreal.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Visualization practice breaks our habitual, ignorant thinking

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 so that we can experience the purity and equality of all phenomena

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 and perceive their wisdom and nature.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 I had a questioner who thought about this.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 They kind of emphasized at the beginning going beyond the five senses,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 so that would leave the sixth sense of mind as the principal actor.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 What would be an example of going beyond the five senses

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 and breaking through our normal ordinary way of perceiving things?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Anyone think of a specific example?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Maybe this wouldn't be considered beyond the five senses, but maybe a parallel.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 You think about how, as a basic example, like when you use a microscope,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 it's a tool, and of course the naked eye isn't going to be seeing

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 the detail of protozoa the same way that, okay, magnify it 50 times.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Oh, look at all these beautiful details.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 All the tools of science are how do we actually expand our perception?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And of course, with science, the metaphor doesn't quite line up with what Vajrayana does

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 because we're just expanding, in the case of a microscope,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 we're just expanding the eye perception.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 But I think at that same way, there's still that understanding that

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 with that use of a tool, in this case Vajrayana,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 you'll see something that you couldn't see with your five senses.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 In the case of science, you're using a tool to see something

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 that you can't see normally with your eye faculty.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 It's on a base level.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 It seems to kind of like, I got the impression more of Shazar talking here.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 We rely on our five senses as to things we've seen with our eyes

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 that we're eventually used to seeing.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Things we hear, and taste, and smell, and touch,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 and are the ways our bodies appear and our world appears.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 But then with the Vajrayana meditations,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 I mean like we don't so often see, for example,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 like a being the size of the universe,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 like who's brighter than five trillion moons on a glacial mountain

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 with eleven faces and one thousand arms,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 and nectar is flowing to all the beings of all the realms

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 and satisfying all the hungry ghosts.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Examples like that, that's kind of something we don't ordinarily see.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So, you know, I think that's not a technical point they're putting as far as that,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 like the five senses and the mind sense,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 but just that we take everything that's real just for the limited experience we have.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And these instructions and visualizations involve sights and sounds

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 and, you know, the senses, but it's expanding possibilities,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 like settling down into another lighter kind of possibility.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 I was thinking about along those same lines,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 how the, like the, as soon as you visualize and say the creation stage,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 say if you close your eyes, that has nothing to do with the eye consciousness anymore.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Any image in your mind is purely mental because the eye is not perceiving anything,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 the mind is perceiving the mind, just like in a dream.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 So it's like in one second or in one minute you can have a whole vast dream

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 and totally fill in all the details of the dream with a world and a history

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 and all the different characters and actors,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and it all takes place within the space of mind, which is really, you know,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 the five senses are inactive basically, you're just asleep to outward appearances.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 But on the internal state, like Kinchen Trang Gurubhaj,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 that really struck me in this, I think he has a book,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Everyday Consciousness and Buddha Awakening, about the eight consciousnesses.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 But he really says that visualization creation stage practice

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 is all about just training the mind, and visualization has nothing to do with the eyesight.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 So you can see the deity from the front and the back and the top and the bottom

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 at the same time because it's not related with space and time,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 like the five senses normally are.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 So that was kind of a cool point to me.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 That kind of struck me about the first part being like,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 not your habitual way of, you know, just see something from the front,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 that means you can't see behind, you know, kind of thing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Or even, even in depictions, I mean, they're all, they're drawn, you know,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 so it's like, you know, we can only do so much with our eye,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 I mean, where our mind can make it three dimensional.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 I was thinking about that today, but it's just like, if we really get creative with it,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 I mean, which is the point, I mean, I guess, in a way within, yeah, confines,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 but how we can make it living or real or, I don't know, it's fascinating how that goes.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Yeah, I think that my understanding is not from personal experience,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 but that if you can really concentrate in terms of the visualization,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 that you're actually, your ordinary sense perceptions can actually be sort of overcome.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 You know what I mean? That you can drop off that sense,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 the usual sense of impressions will actually drop away at a certain point of concentration,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 and that, you know, they talk about how eventually people often visualize with their eyes open,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 but they're seeing the visualization, they're not seeing the table particularly,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 they're actually being able to see the visualization that their concentration is so strong,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 that the senses have, ordinary senses have somewhat dropped away.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Does that make sense? Sorry.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 No, I guess more than somewhat. They say they really do.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 I haven't experienced this, but I've certainly heard about that.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 That's like when we're daydreaming, too.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Yeah, that's right. We know about that.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 [Laughter]

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 It's just your fantasy.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 But when you're daydreaming, I mean, you're not really using your five senses that well.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 No, I'm not, because you're just out of it, really.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 I would say, too, maybe a related point with,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 or something that struck me, too, with this first topic point.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 The Dvashriyana, or this visualization creation stage practice,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 isn't so much about just seeing something more subtle.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 It does include things that are more subtle that we don't usually see.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 But I think a lot of part of the point is also the flexibility

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 of what perspectives we take.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 It can be really small and then become really big.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 It can be seen from this side or that side, just like you said.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And it can transform into something different.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 It's really uprooting, like in that quote here,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 "It is because our mind's habitual ways of discriminating between things

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 create a static world that is actually unreal."

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 It's like that freezing of our experience that we so take for granted

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 that this perceiver in here just matter-of-factly knows what's going on

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and what is presented to the perceiver is just what's really out there, going on.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 But to actually use the imaginative or the creative capacity of mind

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 to actually open up and directly experience it,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 as if we're pretending things, but to actually become more flexible,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 to take multiple perspectives simultaneously,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 to break through that, just that they were so convinced.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 It's just this way, this way that we've experienced it before,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 that matter-of-fact taken for grantedness gets loosened up

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 and it gets more flexible and more sensitive and more fluid and dynamic.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Like the nature, it changes more easily.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 So I would say the flexibility of the cognitive capacity,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 as well as the precision with the concentration

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and the vividness with the fresh present awareness,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 that all those things really play into this visualization stage practice.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 And that with that ability to take more perspectives,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 it's so interesting how our static way, like what you said,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 of seeing things is actually unreal.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 In other words, we're fabricating now

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 and everybody takes that fabrication to be real

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 and that's the status quo, that's the five senses.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 So then sometimes people think, but then the visualization is not real.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 The visualization is a fabrication because you're creating something

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 and it's called the creation stage. And that's true, you know?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 That's true, you are fabricating something, especially in the beginning.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 But you're working with the flexibility

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 and taking the perspectives of untraining your mind

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 to see things in a static, fixed, unreal way,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 so that you're actually becoming closer to the way things really actually are,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 like the display of Agyasattva's Pure Land and Guru Palma Samhara.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 So that's the interesting point of the vodka when it turns everything on its head,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 that the way that it is now is actually pure.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 That's the real thing, even though it's not substantially existing or solid.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 So it's like, I just always find it interesting, it's an important point,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 that like, oh, you're making something up with visualization.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Yeah, I'm making something up with visualization.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 I'm making something up right now all the time with my normal,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 diluted habit patterns oppressing my perspectives on everything all the time.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 So you have to undo that, you have to have some mechanism,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 and the vodka is so beautiful because it has so many methods of systematically undoing it,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 whether it's in the dream state, in the waking state,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 and you know what I mean? It uses all those boring, normal, real ways of doing things

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 and so it flips it, you know, until spontaneously,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 like I think they say later in the chapter, like the Buddha's display,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 spontaneously they perceive things as that spontaneous display of purity,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 and equality, and the Pure Land stuff.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And that is the, that is real from that perspective, you know?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 That kind of goes into the second point.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 I have something I wanted to mention too, but I don't know if it's in the second point.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I just wanted, because in terms of what Andrew was saying about the whole thing

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 getting into the purity and sort of this, the bhajra yana creation stage

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 as a segue into purity is that, one way you can look at it is that

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 when we're visualizing ourselves as an enlightened being,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 we're visualizing all those qualities of the enlightened being,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 like the compassion and the wisdom, and then as we're doing that,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 we start to actually feel those qualities, that we're deliberately cultivating those qualities

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 and actually, then at some point you sort of realize that those are your qualities.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.680
 You are that, and therefore, and everyone is that, you know, so that it actually, it takes you

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.000
 there.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 It takes you there by just simply contemplating the Buddha, whatever Buddha it is,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 then you start feeling it, especially if you're doing the kind of visualization

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 where you're doing the light rays going out to all beings and coming back,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 and to the Buddhas and coming back, you know, so that you're actually

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 really sort of dynamically projecting that love, that wisdom, that ability.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And it's a really wonderful technique in terms of that discovery of your own qualities

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 through the technique of visualizing the deity.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Actually, it's kind of, this is a slightly jokish version of what you were saying.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 I remember once I was watching Rinpoche, and someone was juggling a lot of things,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 you know, they were doing a lot of different tasks, and you start laughing a little bit.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 He's like, "Oh, your Chenrezig practice is praying off. You got four arms now."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 But, you know, it's a jokish way, but I think very similar to what you're saying,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 in that sense of, you know, or a jokish way of highlighting as much as, you know, those qualities.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 But they do, you know, they shine through, and there's that familiarity with it as well.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Yeah, that you're actually cultivating those states of mind.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 You're cultivating these extremely positive qualities as you do the practice.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And the essential point, like Liah often brings up, the original title of this book,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Opening to Our Primordial Nature.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Oh, that's the second title.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 The second title.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 [laughter]

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But the point being, that's the fundamental point.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Our nature is primordially pure. And like they say here,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 in order to display the self-existing primordial wisdom, that's exactly what you're saying.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 It's the display of our self-existing primordial wisdom.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 That's what we're connecting with through this practice.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 It's not connecting with the diluted display of our unreal habit patterns, you know.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 It's connecting with our primordial wisdom, which is displaying all the time.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And the Vajrayalas, that means through which we recognize that.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 It's so profound indeed.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Could I say one more thing?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Yeah.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Because it's nice now. I mean, just, it's great.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Just that point of this visualization practice being fundamentally based on the Sutra Mahayana

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 realization

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 or insight of emptiness, of all outer phenomena and all inner experiencer.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 So everything, outer and inner is emptiness.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And that's very clear in the teachings on those three samadhis.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 And this is the basis of visualization practice.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.420
 The first thing we do in practice is try to recognize the emptiness nature of our awareness and our

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.000
 experience.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.620
 And then the second samadhi is its expression arising infinitely without yet having any fixed focus

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.000
 object

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:29.020
 but just unbounded qualities like total open flexible nature, like radiating boundlessly without

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.000
 any particular object or activity it's trying to do.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 And then just spontaneously.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.240
 And then thirdly, then those qualities crystallize into this visualization practice we're talking

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.000
 about.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.110
 And then that gets more and more detailed and elaborate too with more active, engaging details or

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.000
 outreaching activities or something.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.660
 But it's just to say sometimes, I just wanted to highlight that point, that it's really based on

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.000
 that emptiness

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 or the fundamental inside of the Sutra Mahayana teachings of the Buddha.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 That without this, that without the emptiness, it is pretend.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 And we're always trying to connect to that nature, the cause is empty, the result is empty.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.420
 But when it's empty, it still arises because there's always form and how does it arise purely as a

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.000
 deity in an enlightened universe doing enlightened activities.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.860
 And so just to highlight that emptiness, it's not as if it's just, we're like covered in costuming

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.000
 everything in a nice way or something.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 It's like the magical illusion samadhi, even though the arising, the magical.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.410
 It's okay to go into the second point, we'll do a quick summary of it going more to this completion

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.000
 stage dissolution practice.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.780
 So the Kapurama Chas talk about the completion stage practice as being divided into two principal

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.000
 sections.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.420
 There's first the completion stage with characteristics and then secondly the completion stage

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.000
 without characteristics.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 So the completion stage with characteristics is emphasized in Anayoga level of Buddha's teaching

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 and is also called, as in this text, subtle completion stage.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.580
 Or completion stage with a focus, this type of completion stage with characteristics still involves

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.000
 grasping or holding on to some type of structure.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.010
 Then the completion stage without characteristics is emphasized in Zochen or the Atayoga level of

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.000
 the teachings and it's also called great completion stage.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.480
 Or completion stage without any focus, without relying on any structures, effort or any grasping at

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.000
 all.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.420
 And so in this chapter they're emphasizing completion stage with characteristics, which applies to

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.000
 one's physical body.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.130
 Not only is the outer environment and its inhabitants all perceived as being already enlightened,

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.000
 but within our own actual body are countless enlightened universes and enlightened beings.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 And this is the true nature of our body and our speech.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 This practice principally is connected to the three main systems of our body.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.680
 The channels wind energy and essence elements, which we discussed previously in chapter 10 which

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.000
 begins page 49.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.190
 And then by focusing on our channels, the temporary knots, this is what Rinpoche has discussed in

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.000
 this chapter.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.080
 By focusing on our channels, the temporary knots or blockages are released which allows our refined

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.000
 wisdom winds to move more freely throughout our body.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.340
 Eventually pervading all of our channels so that our essence elements are undisturbed by our dual

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:48.000
ity mind and freely allowed to be as they naturally are, this natural bliss emptiness.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.390
 For someone who has mastered creation and completion stage practices, their enlightened activities

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.000
 are unrestricted by limited dualistic habits.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.050
 So they can fulfill the two purposes of greatly benefiting themselves and others by helping all

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.000
 beings realize enlightenment.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.530
 They then work constantly and only work to benefit all beings without experiencing any sense of

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.000
 stress or burden.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 They effortlessly, spontaneously emanate enlightened activities.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.160
 There's much more that exists than Rinpoche's conclude the chapter saying there's much more that

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.000
 exists than we can perceive with our limited senses.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.450
 And they say they're mentioning these very advanced Bhatriyana practices to emphasize how precious

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.000
 we all are and how precious this opportunity is.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.270
 And that we can actually use these practices to reveal our hidden enlightened nature and attain

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:48.000
 enlightenment in this very life to effortlessly help all beings everywhere.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 That's the chapter.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.300
 So on page 81, the second full paragraph, and then it jumps over to page 82 on the first full

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.000
 paragraph.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 After making progress in the visualization practice, one does the completion stage meditation.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 The subtle completion stage practice applies to one's physical body.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 From the Bhatriyana point of view, the body is no longer seen as unpleasant or impure.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Rather, it is considered to be totally enlightened.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 The structure of the body corresponds to the structure of the external world.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.270
 And the body is recognized as the indestructible Vajra body and as a Vajrasiddhi filled with

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.000
 enlightened beings.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 The activities of enlightenment go far beyond ordinary concepts.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.210
 According to both Mahayana and Vajrayana, the purpose of accomplishing enlightenment is to benefit

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.000
 all sentient beings.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.750
 So one of the things that struck me, actually it was in the second line when it mentions the subtle

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.000
 completion stage practice applies to one's physical body.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 I guess the word that struck me was subtle.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 When they're saying that, what other levels of completion stage are being implied there?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Are they talking about a gross completion stage?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 How is that put into context with the word subtle, I guess?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 With characteristics.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Completion stage without characteristics, I think.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Completion stage with characteristics.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And this is with characteristics.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 This is what they're referring to.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Yeah.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.130
 Like when you practice on an illusory body and the channel's winds, the essence elements, that's

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.000
 all.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Completion stage with characteristics.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Okay.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Thank you.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 I'm pretty sure that's what gave me my subtle completion stage.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 It seems like we're in a subtle body.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Is without characteristics very subtle?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 That's not holding at all the innermost.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Yeah, the innermost.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Okay. Yes, I see.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 That makes more sense.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 I mean, it's really so beautiful just that even in those few lines, it just goes down and down.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Vajra body goes into that enlightened body.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Oh, and then if you go further into that, now it's a whole mandala, it's a whole city.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 All these enlightened beings, you're going to just clear and clear and clear.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.220
 As you were saying before, it's like, "Oh, yeah, you perceive it this way. Have fun when you get to

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.000
 the goods."

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 I know.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 It's quite beautiful.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.790
 It's totally, utterly, radically different than our usual way of experiencing things, than our

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.000
 usual habit.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.650
 I mean, really, it's really good to take stock even if we've done Vajrayana practice for a long

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.000
 time,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 or we've read a lot of books, or we're totally new. This is like really saying that everything,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 all the forms and things we experience, they're totally enlightened.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 All the sounds and the communicating systems, the flowing patterns are all enlightened.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 All the thoughts and emotions, where they come from, our mind is already enlightened.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 So it is not enlightened.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 From this view, nothing. From this view. From how a Buddha experiences things,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 which is what these techniques are trying to train us to jump into,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 to see how does an enlightened being experience things.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Meaning, how do we experience things right now, when our nature is revealed to ourselves,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 and we don't lock it up with any mistaken habits.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 But it's just good, it's just so radically different than how we experience things.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 So I think it's good to emphasize that point.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 And at the same time, like Rinpoche is really clearly emphasizing the point that it's so natural.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Actually, the funny thing is, this is the most natural thing we could ever do,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 is be in our balanced mind, speech, and form.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 One of the things that's interesting about seeing the completion stage,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.300
 particularly with this perspective too, is that it also puts the creation stage in a slightly

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.000
 different perspective.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Particularly from someone who's really new at this, creation stage sometimes can feel like,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 "Okay, I'm kind of painting on this visually."

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And I think we talked about this a lot before.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It feels like you're kind of painting it on, and it's like,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 "Okay, I'm going to do this, and I'm not really quite sure what it's doing,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 but I'm going to do it."

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 You see all the people who practice it, and they're just pretty awesome people.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 And then at the same time, when you get to the completion stage,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 I think because so often there isn't a lot of words put on it,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 it can be easy to fall in with your own habitual patterns.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Seeing completion stage is like, "Okay, I'm dropping that visualization,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 and now I'm back to things the way I'm used to seeing it."

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So it's so beautiful to see the completion stage from this way.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Because then it's saying, "Well, if you really want to get into it,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 your creation stage was actually giving you much more of the truth

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 than dropping that creation stage and then thinking you have the truth."

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 I think we've already said a lot of that, but it was just interesting,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 particularly the way that they really put completion stage in that perspective,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 where if you're really practicing the completion stage,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 you see the mandala, you see the vajra vai, it's all there.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 That's actually getting past the conceptual framework

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 that makes you think, "Oh, this is more real."

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Or the emptiness is blank, like some other completion stage,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 or it's just like a vacuum, but that's kind of getting things going.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 That is beyond that.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 A point on that is that can be revealed in different ways,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 like the creation stage and completion stage is a huge, giant topic,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 but sometimes they reveal it sequentially like the creation stage

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 and then the completion stage.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Sometimes they talk about it as far as the inseparability

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 of the creation stage and completion stage,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 so there's no distinction really.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 In that sense, the creation stage is more the absolute nature

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 within which the whole visualization takes place.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 So from the basis of the completion stage,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 we engage in the creation stage, which is an inseparable spontaneous display

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 of the arising energy, and then once that's dropped,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 it's the completion stage still.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 So in other words, a lot of times at Zogchen you hear the inseparable union

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 of the creation and completion stage.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Is that the same with the Dharmadhatu in the Dharmakaya?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Is it like that?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Do you know?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 As far as...

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Yeah, I can't remember.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 I can't remember how it came up, but...

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 I think it's more like the...

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 In this context, maybe it's more like the Dharmakaya

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 and its expression being the two form Kayas,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 the Samboka Kaya and the Ramana Kaya.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Maybe it's more of a correlate.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 The open, infinite, unrestricted, boundless nature arising,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 like having that natural capacity to arise,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 and then in ways that responsibly engages with bodhichitta

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 to bring to utter fulfillment everything that's involved.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 I was just thinking about the question of

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 why this level of the subtle body with the channels,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 winds and essence element is part of the completion stage

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 rather than sort of part of the creation stage

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 since you're still holding a focus.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And it's almost like the inner mandala,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 rather than sort of the outer mandala of seeing the D&D,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 like when we do Dejanjama, Queen of Great Blitz,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 the first piece is about the outer deities,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 in a sense, her body, guru-pavasambhava, and so forth.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 But then the second mantra, we actually go into

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 all those deities that are inside her body,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 that it's like a subtler level of completion stage.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Creation stage.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 But then, I just answered my question in my mind,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 which I'd like to bring up.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 It's just that the idea that the reason...

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 I would think that one reason why...

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 We can talk about that,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 why this is completion stage or not, creation stage is an interesting question.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 But one thing is that I think that when you do this kind of creation stage,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 completion with form, with characteristics,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 that what it does is it brings the wisdom wind into the central channel

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 and therefore you actually experience nature of mind,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 which is what the great completion stage is,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 is that direct experience of nature of mind.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 So that that would be maybe why it's included in completion stage

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 is that that is a way to induce that

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 for people who can't just actually sort of receive the transmission

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 and see it directly.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 But anybody else have any thoughts about why it would be completion stage

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 and not further a subtler creation stage?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Not after what you said.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 [laughter]

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Somebody had to.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 So we're saying there's many perspectives.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 [laughter]

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Maybe in some ways...

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 I mean, I think it's...

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 What I'm going to say I think is echoing what you're saying,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 but that part of how focusing on the subtle body

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 or the channels and the winds and the essence element,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 according to the instructions,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 we're starting to pay attention to something that...

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 that we all directly have.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And yes, but there's that part of it,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 so that it involves some degree of visualization,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 but it's kind of like tuning in.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Like even if we think like, "Oh, can I feel my heartbeat?"

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Or, "Can I feel my center of gravity?"

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Or you know, just tuning,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 like bringing that awareness to this subtler level and the natural.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Because part of that is that we're...

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 it seems like we're tuning into what's naturally arising,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 and by being attention it starts to balance as well,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 which is what you were saying.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 But that part of how once things are already happening,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 but when the winds start to balance and come into harmony

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 and merge with the central channel,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 it's happening.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 And so in a way it already is complete in that sense of how...

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 it's like things...

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 appearances are just spontaneously arising,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 and when we have all the basis of, you know,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 the view ends with, you know,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 this meditation kind of activated.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 I guess it's that sense of when it's activated,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 which is what you're saying too.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Sorry, it wasn't there yet.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Yeah, no, but it is a slightly different slip.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 That's what I was talking about there, each of us sees things slip differently.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Well, you can also see it as the union too.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Like they say all the inner tantras are actually the same,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 just slightly different emphasis.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 They all include them, they all include each other.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 So, oftentimes Rinpoche is quote the...

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Tantra, I guess Haruka Kapil, I don't know.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 But they say, "Mahayoga is the ground,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Anya Yoga is the path, and Ahti Yoga is the completion."

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Always quote that.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 So, Mahayoga, the whole everything is a mandala.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 That's the view in a way.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Anya Yoga, that what is outward is also inward,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 so you've lost that sense that it's just an outward mandala.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Everything is a mandala.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 One's own wins and essence elements and channels are that.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And then Ahti Yoga is a completion.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 It's all in that total vastness, emptiness state of the nature, always, all the time.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And it's just where there's a completion stage without characteristics is

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 not tuning in specifically at that more subtle level,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 maybe just letting everything go.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 This is a whole thing, you know.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 It's a... I don't know.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 What is the whole thing? What's the end?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Completion state with characteristics.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Like they say, the Kala Chakra is the most majestic of Tantras

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 because it really goes into all the whole universe of the Vajra body

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 as a whole cosmos and it brings all that in one state.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 So some people say that's the vastness of all the Tantras is kind of...

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 the Kala Chakra is a good example of the whole shebang.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 But it's the completion stage.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 And from that sense that it's all...

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 it's Maha Yoga, Arman Yoga, Ahti Yoga, everything is complete.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Within that, the arising, the mandala is arising within that awareness.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 One thing, there's a small thing that came up in my brain.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 I was thinking about the different books that I've gone through

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 that start to detail the Dzogchen practices

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 or pointing out the nature of the mind.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 It seems so often the words "as it is" come up again and again.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 And actually sometimes in the book they italicize "as it is."

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And I think that may be one of the reasons

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 that it's considered the completion practice with character.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 You know, it's the "as it is."

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 The mandala is there, the Vajra body.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 It's not like these things are being projected on.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 The mind is projecting so many things,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 but this is "as it is."

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 It's not that this is being projected.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 This is just "rest, see what's there."

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 I think we've made it just a simple one, but it just can't.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 It's a good one.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 I thought one point to go on with that

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 is that so much from what we've heard from chemical images

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 and other great masters as well

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 is that so much of the efficacy

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 and the heart of this is really

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 being with this practice as we do it.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Like really sincerely just dropping our doubt,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 dropping our critical investigation for our practice period

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 and just really trying to sink into,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 connect to the teaching according to the instruction.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 And also how do we do that really?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Like relax.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 We have to put effort into doing it,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 but it should be kind of relaxed.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Otherwise it can get really tight

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 and becomes a big heavy burden.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 And then we can be like,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 "Oh, I don't have to do all this work anyway

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 because it's all free anyway."

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 We can go that mistake way.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 So while this visualization practice

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 and while these accumulations.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 And then there's two reasons on the inside.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 We have all these habits, all these knots in our channels,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 all these imbalances.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 And these are techniques that very directly, quickly undo,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 like target and undo and relax and release these tensions.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 And at the same time,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 the whole basis is to bodhicitta motivation.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 What is that?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 We have to communicate with other beings

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 in ways that are helpful.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 And to send out light, like Anne was saying,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 or to actually express,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 we have to learn how to be flexibly engaged with other beings.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 It's not just our own private path or something.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 But then there's all these practices working with pure form

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 and pure sound on our own awareness.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 This is actually a bodhisattva practice

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 to communicate and help all beings be enlightened.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 So it's not like a big job.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 We have to do all this stuff.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 And we should just rest.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Like Rivichette said at the very end,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 "We are resting."

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 And that spontaneously is like this outreaching word

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 to benefit all beings.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 I have this one, Dogo Kensi,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 in his beautiful fifth instructions on Zochen that he gives.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 It always struck me how this on that point that you said.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 He said, "Even when you're meditating on the channels,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 winds, essence elements, or the tumo,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 or all these different techniques,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 don't withdraw your consciousness within

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 as though there's a "you" here

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 and then everything else that's not that.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Just like what you said.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 You're not just closing everything out

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 and just focusing on something inward.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 But that's the nature of the outer

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 and the inner is the same.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 And I think that's part of the point, relaxing in that.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 That always struck me how it's like,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 "But it seems like you're really focusing."

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 But that's the completion stage.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 You're not.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 Even if you're using the winds

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 and holding the breath in a certain way,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 the whole thing is in that state.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 It's so vast, you know?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Ross, you have anything to say?

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Well, it sounds wonderful.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 [laughter]

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 [singing]

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 [singing]

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 [singing]
