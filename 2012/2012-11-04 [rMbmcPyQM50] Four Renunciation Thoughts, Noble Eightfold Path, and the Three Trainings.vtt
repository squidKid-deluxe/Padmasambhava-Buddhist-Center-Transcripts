00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 "As I said yesterday, even you follow these texts in a way, but what I'm saying is something that

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.430
 you can apply to every practice, not just every practice, but every session, every session that we

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.000
 begin, every day we begin, every breathe we breathe, breathe we can apply.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.430
 It's not just something once and a while in the blue moon we are going to apply and do that. It is

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.000
 what we should. This is what we practice.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 And that is all the great masters. Everyone says start with the foundations, start with the ground,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.280
 stand. It's like earth where we stand. There is no way we can hover all the time in the sky. Once

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 and a while we will have good, what's called a kayak.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.840
 Glide. Glide. Maybe we can jump on the cliffs once and a while. And we are lucky, maybe it flew for

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.000
 maybe 50, 20, 100 hours, whatever.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.440
 But otherwise, we have to stand on this foundation. Foundation is grown, is why we are going to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.000
 grow. And deepening in a tall and strong map from there, then we can fly as birds.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.740
 Narudas and not kind of dependent to any other means of the sports we do. That is what. And to do

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.000
 this, as I said yesterday, the four renunciation thoughts.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.720
 Four renunciation thoughts are not just only we do, once and a while. Every time we should reflect

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:52.150
 this teaching. In the teaching of the great master, Kim Po-Makchon, and it's not just only him, but

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.650
 he said, we don't have this four renunciation thought, even at the beginning of our session, our

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.000
 practice won't become smooth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.920
 Because not observing in the heart is the only hovering on the brain. Heart is what we like to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.130
 observe. We like to make meaning for this practice from time we started till we end, till we are

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 going to conclude the practices.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.120
 Beautiful, powerful, the college, college practices, not just time recorded practices, history

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.000
 practices, we like to practice. That's beautiful qualities.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:43.240
 And that's why for example, we are in retreat. Retreat is what what means, really. Observe with the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.770
 teaching in the heart. That is what really actually retreat means. Observe with the teaching into

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.070
 the heart, not hovering, floating on the surface of the brain and coming from the right ear and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.000
 leaving from another ear as emergency exits.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.040
 That is not the religion. Retreat. And that is not the practice. We practice and do retreat,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 observing teaching into the heart and make ourself as done as teaching. That is what it is.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Therefore, to do this for renunciation is so important. Essence of renunciation I said yesterday.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 What? Joy in appreciation and joyful effort and make useful and then thoughtful.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.680
 Thought for every hour activities. Activities that means what every activity. I'm vaguely saying

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 that. There is three activities. It's called body activities. The speech activities and mind

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.000
 activities.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.110
 Thoughtful. Nobody is going to thoughtful from outside way expected. We're not going to use any sc

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:05.000
um, words, and blame someone. We're going to take full responsibility. Ourself, full responsibility.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.750
 To ourself, we need to come to the heart, our heart, our practices. We're going to take completely

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.890
 full responsibility. And so thoughtful with the activities of the body, thoughtful activities of

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.000
 the speech, the verbal communication, and thoughtful with our mental activities.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 That is the starting point. Thought is the starting point of the activity of the verbal and body.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.880
 Every hour movement we do, by speech, by physical, all reflected, all is ignited from this

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:00.560
 emptiness mind. From this emptiness mind, unseen mind. From this mind, it started. All that. And

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.000
 therefore, thoughtful.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.050
 Thoughtful. And then what is next is have courage. In the samsara there are so many difficult

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.380
 troubles that we know. But it's learning ground in the Buddha said, in the Buddha teaches it. It's

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.000
 learning ground. It's exercise playground.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.750
 And therefore, be courage. Be strong. Not just only always kind of perishable. And kind of very per

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:42.250
ishable and sensitive. And kind of the pushed and knocked way instantly. Kind of small grass, hollow

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.000
 or feathery. Feathery. Be courage. Be strong. Strong.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.130
 That is the essence of this forenal sessions. With this understanding, then we also that all

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:07.030
 reflected the samsara cause and effects. Samsara cause and effects. As samsara has cause and sams

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.000
ara has effect.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.970
 And that you avoid that to move from that. Then we follow the path. Path is in the Buddha's first

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:25.170
 teaching is at Noble Path. That is the first starting point of the journey. When we take the

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.000
 journey, that is what we should begin with that at aspect.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.210
 And as aspect I again all at I listed and condense it so that we can apply little more tangibly. As

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:48.000
 not just I did, I follow in footsteps of the great masters and those great teachers.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.400
 Teachers and the Buddha himself taught. They all can be summarized this head into three. The

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:03.000
 personal training. The individually training practices. Extraordinary trainer practices.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:16.860
 And those are known as the morality, concentration and the vistas. Morality is something out

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.000
reaching volatice. This is something more related with our physical and verbal things. Outreaching.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.640
 The people can see, look, you can see in the field. That is known as morality. And the good, this

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.170
 morality is good for you. Morality is good for the others. Acting is good for you individually and

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.000
 acting is good for the others.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 It is also good examples of others and good example yourself. Inspiring yourself. Inspiring others.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 For example, they said the morality is how important in the teaching. First five students.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.370
 The first five students is one of those known as Tatu. Tatu is the way he act, the way he speak,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.000
 the way he move. He is so gentle, so beautiful, so peaceful.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.760
 Among all the students, the Arhatas, the golden mortems, the glowing golden mortems of the students

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:25.000
, of the Buddhas. Among that, Tatu was the best Buddha. Acknowledged in it, enormous.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.530
 Tatu's conduct is the best among all Arhatas. Those Arhatas, great Arhatas, stainless masters,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.000
 realization beings.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 There are always in the teaching, there are golden mortems, surrounded by the big golden mortems.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Buddha himself. Such great golden mortems. Among that, Tatu was one of them.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.320
 And how the great up disciple of the Buddha Shakyamuni, the shari potter, mongol potter, we have

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:08.000
 here, stage of that. And standing here in the right and left side of the Buddha and also there too.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.050
 The Buddha here, the shari potter, mongol potter. How first shari potter become the disciple of the

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:24.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni? Because of Tatu, master of Arhata, Tatu's conduct.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.980
 Where he dressed up, where he's moving, where he's spoken, where he's gazing, looking, it's so upl

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.410
ifting. And shari potter was far distance in the Rajaguni, in the nearby bamboo grooves, in the

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.000
 center of India or northern India.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.100
 When he saw, Tatu, this must be something that's so special. He must be itchy or he must be called

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.000
 nakto. It's complete nourishment. He looks like a so nourishment person.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 A master contract to this person to give. That way he got this nourishment, called nakto.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.550
 And he went, immediately went, because of his gesture, his movement, his conduct is so appealing,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.000
 so uplifting, so calming, so beautiful. Beautiful.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:25.160
 And then Tatu, so shari potter went and asked, "Who are you and who is your teacher?" And what this

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.000
 teacher told him.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.160
 And shari potter, I mean Tatu said, he said, "I'm Tatu and I'm disciple of great sage known as Bod

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.000
ashaktamuni."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.740
 And moment he, shari potter heard Bodashaktamuni, it meant something, completely changed himself,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.940
 completely. Like it electrocuted through his like walls or the veins, really kind of like

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.000
 completely racked up something.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.940
 And then he asked, "What was his teaching? What he giving?" And then shari potter, so Tatu said, "

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.000
He's teaching that what we can't."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.140
 So all the pranamana comes from the cause, and that cause is taught by the Buddha, good cause

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.000
 taught by the sage, and we are out of that, also taught by the sage.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 That is roughly translated, but in Sanskrit we can't always. That was the teaching of the sage.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.270
 Thakur repeated that one word, shari potter god, the first Bhumi Realization according to Vinayas,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.000
 or according to Theravada, he saw the truth.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:11.400
 And then he and the Mughal potter both are best friend, best friend, and they have promise to each

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.000
 other, whoever gain the nectar, god nectar, immediately going to share to the others.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 They say, "We have to share each other." So as they promise to each other, when shari potter god,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 he thought shari potter must share this to the mughal potters.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.540
 And he run to the mughal potter, mughal potter. And mughal potter saw far away shari potter, and in

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:41.000
 mughal potter saw shari potter's skin and complexion are glowing.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.340
 So beautiful. He said, "It looks like mughal potter." He said, "It looks like you got nectar." He

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.000
 said, "Yes, I got the nectar."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Yes, what that nectar is. And shari potter repeated what he heard from Dato.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 He said, "One time, two time, three time, and third time, mughal potter god, the Realizations."

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 That all started with the beautiful conduct, beautiful moralities.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 So therefore, morality is outreaching, and morality is the ornament of ours or any individual's.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.030
 Therefore, this noble path, all can be summarized into the morality, and then after that,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.000
 concentrations.
