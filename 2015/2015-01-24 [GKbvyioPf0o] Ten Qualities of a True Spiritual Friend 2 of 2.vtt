 "And then not just only the speaker, good speakers, speaker of good, sorry not all that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.880
 call it, but that individual also has meditate in practice has some realizations, realizations,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.600
 some realizations of the meaning, teachings, such as bahana, shamada, really good realizations,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.040
 not just only know those knowledge, but have realizations. So that is seven qualities.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 Then the ad-colleges, we need to be expanded to help the other friends, how those friends

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 also have a kind of good way to present those knowledge, those teachings to the others and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 speak as well, that is ad-colleges. And then always very kind, nine qualities, always very

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 kind, always very compassionate. Every heart is completely filled with compassion, loving kindness

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 and also to help and support others. So that is the ninth. And the fourth, so the ninth,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 tenth is they're not bored, not tired, tired to help others or help to the friends and also

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.480
 can present according their readiness, according the situation, not enforcing, not forcing,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.600
 but consider the kind of available, make understanding and sharing and supporting,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 according their readiness and the part bring up to the growth for broomstickers.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:08.400
 So those 10 qualities is mentioned then in the Mahayana scriptures. This is then the whole mark,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.760
 again the whole mark, qualification of the perfect teachers, one who has these 10 qualities,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.960
 definitely they are the perfect spiritual friends. One who has not completed everything, then less

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:39.040
 complete perfect teachers. So this can be can be as corrected by the words of the Buddha told.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.000
 This is also qualified spiritual friends. Once you find that spiritual friends, then what is it?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 In the teaching, teaching, they probably with the standard 37 brackets on both of themselves.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.240
 If you find that student, that spiritual friend, you should always honor and keep even with a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.960
 moment, look more even dear than your own lives. You should respect and appreciate. If you find

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.480
 that is really gold for those who are sitting the spiritual realization, you find that kind of

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 teacher.
