00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you, again. Welcome. Thank you, everyone.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.600
 Again, I'm going to talk a little bit about the teachings of the chap of Dudjo Rinpoche,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:30.060
 as we are continuing on the heart advice for the Four Kayas of the Buddha by His Holiness Dudjo Rin

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.100
poche.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.320
 And this is, as I've said many times, and you also see in this teaching,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 it is an essence, a condense of the teaching of the entire Buddha Dhanam,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 how to put breakfast in a simple, easy, but more direct, more meaningful way, how we can do it.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 I am saying that because the other day the Buddha gave a lot of teaching, I mean, we all know that,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 and there are also so many commentaries and so many teachings, many, many there.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.220
 But those all sometimes are huge and vast and they're deep and they're profound,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 and it needs a lot of time and a lot of effort to spend and to break that knowledge into the tutu

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 practices.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.220
 But this is something really simple, easy, and we put this, as in this teaching said,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 definitely we will get meaningful life and we will be very well off in the spiritual,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.900
 about the spiritual or the Dharma level, it will work. So that's what I'm talking, it's very

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.220
 special teaching.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.220
 And therefore there are reasons, again, it's not just only for that, but we're going to reactivate

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 it with motivation,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 motivation of the joy and appreciation, and as well as vastness, motivation of the Bodhi Jeddha.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 And why I'm saying that vastness, motivation, this is not just, I'm saying,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 always in those great masters, always said in the teachings, vastness, motivations.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 That means that our motivation of the Bodhi Jeddha should not be limited, vast.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:36.220
 How big? As far as sentient beings are existing or gods, as far as living beings are existing.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:46.220
 And in that part, our Bodhi Jeddha goes to every and each living beings.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.220
 So therefore, and also why is vastness living beings, according to Buddhism or Buddha's teaching,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.220
 the number of the sentient beings are like there's no numbers. Number is countless.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.220
 In the teachings said, as far as the sky goes or space goes, that far there is sentient beings.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:26.220
 As long as sentient beings are existing, that much every and each has karma and emotions.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.220
 As long as they have karma and emotions, that much everyone is struggling.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 Therefore, our loving kind is completely, Bodhi Jeddha goes as far as that.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.220
 For that reason, it's known as vastness, motivation of the Bodhi Jeddha.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 And also, how long are we going to do? This is until they reach, everyone is reaching like that.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 That long we are going to keep that, this beautiful motivation of Bodhi Jeddha taught.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:16.310
 Number is all the living beings. Direction is until everyone is become enlightened or become the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.220
 Buddha.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.220
 So that's what is called the vastness, motivation of the Bodhi Jeddha.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.220
 Then, together with that, since this teaching is also lying toward,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.220
 even though this teaching started from as post-Pornavatru teaching or the Vinaya teaching, so forth

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.220
,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.180
 but this ending, finite destination of this teaching goes to the very inner teaching, inner tender

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.220
 teachings.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:54.220
 Therefore, they will see everything as perfection status or three radial status.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 Also, we will open up that door, door of the reality of the true nature, Vedas love.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.220
 Why this need to be done? Because according to the teaching of the Bodhi Jeddha Muni,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 reality, everything is in purity status, both subject and object. Everything is in purity status,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.220
 everything.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.220
 What that means? All is enlightened status.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.220
 And this is why when we read books or when we receive the teachings from the great masters,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.910
 in the teaching open, say, five elements are five female Buddhas, five aggregates are five male

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.220
 Buddhas.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.220
 Everything is enlightened. Everything is a waking state, a purity status.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.750
 Even if you are looking and searching something is impure, the Buddhas were not never going to

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.220
 fight.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:01.220
 What that means? According Buddhism, Buddha knows everything because of omniscient.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:11.220
 Buddha or he or she has no blockage of anything to the past, to the present, to the future.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.220
 Time and space is not existing in enlightened status, in the Buddha world status.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:29.480
 Everything is clay and precise in the world as right in front of us, our objects, even more than

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.220
 that.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.220
 That is what is called. Even the Buddha is looking and searching if there is something is impurity,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.220
 never going to find anything is impurity status. That's how reality level.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.920
 And that is our goal. Again, the practitioner's goal is to discover that energy nature within that

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.220
 this single life times.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:02.220
 So therefore, to open that door of the vegan, lining toward that is very important.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.220
 It is practice. Practice. That's how we really can open.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:15.220
 If we close the door, everything, then we stay always in a dark corner room, dark room.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.020
 Nothing can improve. Therefore, we have to open the power of the mind, not just the power of the

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.220
 mind,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:30.220
 the original power of the wisdom mind that we should open it and begin to see every object,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:39.220
 every subject into that reality status. That is why it is always bringing the purity realizations,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.220
 every beginning of every teaching, in all those great master's teachings,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:56.000
 and as well as in the teaching, teaching also always innovation to bring those motivations and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.220
 thought clearly.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.220
 So bring out all those beautiful qualities, and now we go to them again, to these teachings.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:10.850
 And we've been, the hour we've been talking, we talked about the poor training of the mind or poor

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.220
 inner sessions.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:18.220
 That is generally a symbol to say it is in the samsara.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.220
 So we talk about the samsara, where this samsara is.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.220
 We talk about the fractal lives. We talk about the impermanence.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:35.220
 We talk about the cause and effectors, are inevitable or karma is inevitable.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:43.220
 And we talk about the samsara as a lot of challenges and difficulties. We spoke that.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.220
 So that means this is nothing, again, as I said before many times,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.220
 it's nothing, any kind of new dogma or new philosophy of the Buddhism.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.220
 It is reality of every living beings. We all have gone through this.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:06.220
 And for everyone, it's no exceptions whether you have believed or whether you don't believe.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.220
 It is all the same. So looking to the truth as its truth on a relative role is so important.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.220
 And also looking exactly where things are in absolute level, that's what we like to find.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:26.220
 Truth is truth. So relative truth, that's what really we have to deal in this samsara.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.220
 This is what we have. This is what we are now. We can't go away from that.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.220
 We can't reject this thing. So looking to that is so important in the Buddha's teaching.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.220
 And it's not just only Buddha. And all the great masters said,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.220
 if we recollect those thoughts, it will become more calmer.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.220
 Our mind will become more calmer, more peaceful, more practical and more sensible

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.220
 and develop a lot of good common senses, really good common senses.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.220
 And so they are more humble, more peaceful, more simple, all those good things.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:08.220
 So what we are looking, it will come with knowing the truth exactly as it is.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:15.220
 And also when we reflect those thoughts, it is this big mind, super mindfulness practice.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.220
 We become more thoughtful, calmer. It is therefore mindfulness.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:27.220
 So when we went through that, once we did this, then what in the teaching said,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:34.220
 you are more interested in how to change the direction of this, that situation of this samsara.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:40.220
 And for that reason, we discussed about the Naranas a little bit, about the Naranas.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.220
 And the importance and the benefit and the goodness of Naranas

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.220
 will be followed part of the spirituals, part of the Dhanas.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.220
 That is what it is. And that is also followed in the part of the Dhanas,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:03.220
 is what the great teacher Buddha mentioned or taught in the first teaching, part truth, part truth.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:12.220
 Part truth is the cause to bring the result of the cessation truth on the Narana.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.220
 Narana is not just going to come, come without any cause and conditions.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:25.220
 Narana is going to bring by the part truth.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:35.220
 So therefore, we spoke the benefit of the part, part truth or the Naranas, we very briefly spoke.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.220
 And then we will look to the part truth and always in the teaching said,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.220
 you should meet qualified spiritual friends.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:50.220
 And this is also, there is no history of any enlightened Buddhas

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:59.220
 or any higher realization without the spiritual friend or qualified teacher.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:06.220
 The spiritual friend or the qualified teacher is saying no names.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:14.220
 And we explained there is how many categories of the spiritual friends Buddha.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.220
 We divided into three, even though there is many levels, many different varieties

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.220
 of the spiritual masters, spiritual god, friendess.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:30.220
 But we went to summarize and so tell you, the ordinary individualists

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.220
 and as well as the Bodhisattvas and the Buddhas.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.220
 And our reign, where we are now, mostly, I'm not saying our, all,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:47.220
 but most of all, all of us, our reign, we cannot really meet immediately

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.220
 as higher Bodhisattvas to be ever spiritual friend or the teacher.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:00.220
 And we cannot also meet, unable to meet, as Buddha, as our spiritual friend.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.220
 So we have to go according our reign of the capabilities,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.220
 we should contact spiritual friend of the owners.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:17.220
 And the ordinary, even though I'm using terminology, it's ordinary, but there those,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.220
 all those spiritual master, what I explained in the TK, they're more calmer,

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.220
 more peaceful, more knowledgeable and more kind of knowledgeable

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:30.220
 about their practice in the meditation and understanding of the Buddha teaching

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.220
 and as well as their disciplines and all, those things are like quite good

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.220
 or the discipline level quite good, concentration level quite good,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.220
 understood level of the understanding of the Buddha teaching is quite good

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:50.220
 or better, more better than ourself, let it more better than ourself,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.220
 each of those, let it more, and those are known as everyday,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.220
 everyday practical, ordinary masters or spiritual friends

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.220
 that we can meet and contact with.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.220
 So those we discuss.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.220
 One of we discuss that and then how we follow TK and then we should connect

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.220
 with the three jewels, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.220
 And that's what we are going to discuss here, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.220
 and that is a fourth line or fourth or fifth lines here.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.220
 And of course, you...

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.220
 The ninth here, here, and that is here.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.220
 Tragedy and the three jewels and an impermeable source of roughness.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:51.220
 So here I kind of highlight yesterday that there is three kind of principal points,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:59.220
 three jewels and a tragedy and a three jewels is an impermeable source of roughness.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.220
 So this is the kind of highlight of the statement of this.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:10.220
 So this is, this first three jewels or second of...

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.220
 First is from home.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.220
 This is from our side.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.220
 We have to trust this.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.220
 So that means individuals, those who are practitioners,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.220
 that explain what should they be, what should they have.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.220
 It should have the trust.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.220
 And then to what is the collect of the others that we're going to,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.220
 to whom we're going to trust.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.220
 That is three jewels.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.220
 And then what they are three jewels,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.220
 they are the impermeable source of roughness, three jewels.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:53.220
 So these last three are explaining about the three jewels.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:16:00.220
 They are three jewels and they are impermeable source of roughness.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:08.220
 Or they are forever protectors, forever and ever,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.220
 until we reach enlightenment or become the Buddha.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.220
 That is what is explained.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.220
 And now about the three jewels, of course we all know.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.220
 We all know some, a little bit everyone, we all know.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.220
 But I'm just talking a little bit again to highlight a lot of these things.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.220
 As I said yesterday, so now we talk a little bit about the three jewels.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.220
 Three jewels are the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.220
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha and now the Buddhas.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:46.220
 Generally Buddha is Sanskrit word translated into a debate as Sanjhi.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:51.220
 So that means San jhi, two jewels.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.220
 San means purified.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:00.220
 Jhi means actualized or progressed or developed.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.220
 So that means what that means.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.220
 Sanjhi means or Buddha means in the debate,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:10.220
 one of translated by ancient time those great emanated newsletters.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:18.220
 How say it? Sanjhi, purified and fully developed.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.220
 What purified?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:26.220
 All the obscurations are completely purified.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.220
 Now what that means, all obscurations.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:35.220
 These obscurations can be a gross level, there's two obscurations.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:42.220
 Those are known as emotion obscurations and knowledge obscurations.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.220
 What is emotion obscurations?

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:56.220
 Emotion obscurations are the pipe bosons, pipe bosons and ego clingings.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:10.220
 The end of death, self-emotional, all that development, those are known as emotion obscurations.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.220
 And a very simple way to explain.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.220
 And what is this knowledge obscurations?

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:23.220
 Knowledge obscurations is grasping, clinging.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.220
 And what that also in the teachings, what that means.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.220
 Clinging to the subject, clinging to the object,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.220
 clinging to the activities, action of the subject and object.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.220
 That is knowledge obscurations.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:47.220
 Emotions are, to compare with these two obscurations,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:54.220
 emotion obscurations are more gross obscurations than the knowledge obscurations.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:02.220
 Knowledge obscurations are more subtle, more deeper and more stronger.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:10.220
 Any emotion obscurations are gross to compare with the knowledge obscurations.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:19.220
 So the Buddha completely purified the bond obscurations.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.220
 What is the teaching saying?

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:31.220
 Emotion obscurations will blockage to getting the liberation or the nirvana.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:40.770
 It will prevent, emotion obscurations will prevent to getting the realization or the achievement of

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.220
 the nirvanas.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:50.220
 Knowledge obscurations will prevent the blockage to attainment of the enlightenment of the Buddha,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.220
 fully awake towards.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.220
 So that is what the teaching says.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:03.220
 When you, for example, in the teachings, say, when you require the emotion obscurations,

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:14.220
 that individual is never going to go in the samsara with karma and emotions.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.220
 Karma and emotion, they are out of samsara, even they are in the samsara.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:27.220
 As we said yesterday, samsara is nothing but in the mental state.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:36.760
 As soon as we complete or remove the duality, that moment, we are 100% the one in the nirvana or

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.220
 the enlightened state.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:48.220
 As long as dualities existed, that long still we are in samsara.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:57.880
 When you remove the non-emotion obscurations, such as ego, clinging, pipe holes and so forth, when

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.220
 we remove that,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:07.220
 those when you remove, we are not going to take rebirth in the samsara.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:16.220
 When we went to samsara a few weeks or a few days ago, those six games,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:26.220
 all those games are completely disabled for our range, for us.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:33.220
 We are not going to move as I, not I, use, but example use, how we are spending,

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:40.220
 how we are rotating the samsara as a roller coaster or as a beast in a jar.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:50.220
 We use those examples, that is no more applied to that individual, one who is completely purified

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.220
 the emotion obscurations,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.220
 or ego clinging and that emotion obscurations.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:12.220
 Therefore, it is called known as, when you purify the emotion obscurations, you are in the nirvanas

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:12.220
.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:19.220
 And when you are completely purified the knowledge obscurations, then you are fully awakened.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:29.220
 So Buddha, Buddhas are totally that, the one they purify it, purify it, both obscurations,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.220
 completely purify it.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:40.390
 And then, what they achieved, that all the achievement and realization, everything is completely

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.220
 achieved.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:49.220
 And everything, and what the everything in the teaching said, what everything, to summarize that,

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.220
 to summarize that.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.220
 And in knowledge, the wisdom level, they completely achieved everything what happened.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.220
 And the compared level, they completely reached the peak of the comparison.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:06.220
 And loving kindness level, they reached the peak of that, nothing higher and deeper to go for that,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.220
 there is nothing to go.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.220
 They reached completely.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.220
 And so wisdom and everything is completed.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:26.220
 That is what Buddha, Sanji, Sanji is purified, they are referring to the obscurations that are all

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220
 removed.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:36.960
 J is developed, fully developed, and that indicating of all the realization is achieved. That is

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.220
 the really Buddha.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.220
 And then we were talking about the Buddha yesterday.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:49.510
 We went, it is not just like we are talking, and as the teaching said, then Buddha can be divided

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.220
 four different Buddhas.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.220
 All three Buddhas is generally different.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.220
 Three Buddhas and three poor Buddhas.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:11.220
 Those are, maybe I should, maybe you now misheard what that means, three Buddhas.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:18.220
 I am talking about the Gaiyas, three Gaiyas and three or poor Gaiyas.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.220
 Three Gaya Buddhas, poor Gaya Buddhas.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.220
 So that is it. That is what I am talking.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.220
 Three Gaya Buddhas and four Gaya Buddhas, all the Buddhas.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:37.220
 And these Buddhas, there is, if we talk today, three poor Gaiyas, as I listed yesterday,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:43.370
 and you all know, I am just repreaching our memories that we heard from many great Masters and

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.220
 started in the book.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.220
 I am just going through that again, repreaching that in a way.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:55.220
 Some really think how can it help us to remind each other. That is what I am doing.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:02.220
 So, in a poor Buddha level, a poor Gaya Buddha level, what are those four Gaiyas?

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:16.780
 Buddhas, Gaya and Dharma Gaya, and then some poor Gaya, and in Dharma Gaya, those are the four Gaiy

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.220
as, all poor Buddhas.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:25.220
 These four three Buddhas are, for example, when we were practicing Dharma,

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:33.220
 opening this in the teaching, he said, "Proper the dual purposes, dual purposes."

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:43.220
 Buddha is going to prefer the three purposes, the one's own purpose and purpose to the others.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.220
 That is really what Buddha is going to prefer, or the bodhisattva is going to prefer.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:54.220
 And among that, which is more important for the bodhisattva?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.220
 Proper the purpose of others. That is a problem.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:04.220
 But in order to perform the purpose of others, you have to prepare.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.220
 It comes naturally in the fulfillment of yourself.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:17.220
 So, therefore, even though object, we object, those great bodhisattvas object to fulfill the goal

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220
 and the benefit to others,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.220
 but at the same time, it will also fulfill their goals.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:31.520
 So therefore, it is divided as two purposes, purpose to the others and purpose to the one's own

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.220
 self.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:41.220
 So this poor Kaya of the Buddhas, first two are performing the one's own purposes.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.220
 So that means Dharma Kaya and Sobhava Kaya.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.220
 So Dharma Kaya and Sobhava Kaya.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.220
 Dharma Kaya and Sobhava Kaya have a synonym. I am mixing up that.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:04.220
 Dharma Kaya and Sobhava Kaya are synonyms.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.220
 And then second is Dharma Kaya, that of course we all know.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:17.220
 These two Kayas are known as performing one's own purposes.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:29.220
 They are not hard and poor Kayas. Sambo Kaya and Nirma Kayas are performing the purpose for others.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:37.220
 So that's really how. For that reason, Buddha achieved these four Kayas.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:47.220
 Every time we talk about three Kayas, then Dharma Kaya, Sambo Kaya and Nirma Kaya,

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.220
 I think we all know that.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:28:00.220
 And in that way Dharma Kaya and Nirma Kaya or Sobhava Kaya are in the same status.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:08.220
 Dharma Kaya is, the Dharma Kaya, the fourth Kaya is the division of the third Kaya.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.220
 Third Kaya. So that's how it is.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.220
 And so Dharma Kaya is performing one's own purposes.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:23.220
 And Sobhava Kaya and Nirma Kaya is performing the purpose for others.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:34.220
 So that is. And now what is, if we go over these four Kayas, what is Dharma Kaya or Sobhava Kaya?

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:47.220
 It is the great Dharma Dhatu, or Dharma Dhatu pervasive college of Dharma Dhatu,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:56.220
 which is free from all the complex cities. That aspect of nature, of achievement or realization

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:03.220
 is known as Dharma Kaya or the Sobhava Kaya, Sobhava Kaya.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:11.220
 So that means, again, the union of the emptiness and great wisdom.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:25.220
 That ultimate goal, ultimate nature, achievement is Dharma Kaya, Sobhava Kaya or the fourth Kaya.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:31.220
 And then next one, second one. Dharma Kaya, Dharma Kaya. What that means?

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:41.220
 Dharma Kaya is the clarity or the intelligence aspect of the Sobhava Kaya.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:54.220
 That is Dharma Kaya.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:08.590
 21 groups of the unstained westerns, 21 groups of the unstained or undefiled quality of the western

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.220
s.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:17.520
 Dharma Kaya is, that is the best. But if simple you tell, Dharma Kaya is the complete ultimate

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.220
 clarity,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:28.220
 the wisdom, intelligence aspect of the Dharma Kaya is the Dharma Kaya.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:36.220
 It remains the division of these two Kayas. Sobhava Kaya, I've ever used, maybe just wrote this one

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.220
,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.220
 Sobhava Kaya and Dharma Kaya. It remains that division.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.220
 So one is more emptiness aspect of the true nature,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:50.220
 and the other is the more highlight of the clarity and wisdom aspect of the realization.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:56.220
 There is some more way to tell. That is the division of these first two Kayas.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:04.220
 Kayas. Now this Kaya, this Dharma Kaya, even though it's totally great emptiness,

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:13.420
 pervasive nature and pre-prong all the categories and then every kind of pre-prong, non-existing

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.220
 that level.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:20.220
 But yet it contains all the quality of the enlightened beings.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:30.220
 As we're talking about 21 groups of the stainless or undefiled quality of the enlightenment sense

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:30.220
 is there.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.220
 Summarize all that. What is that?

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.220
 Summarize that is the knowledge, wisdom.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:48.220
 That understanding the relative truth exactly as it is, the absolute truth exactly as it is.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.220
 That is what this knowledge is.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.220
 And that knowledge also contains what?

00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:02.220
 Knowledge, compassion, loving kindness. All that within that nature.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.220
 The nature of the Dharma Kaya.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:11.220
 And a simple way to tell, there is infinite quality, infinite love,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.220
 or seedling quality, not just infinite.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:19.220
 Infinite and seedling quality of the, or bursting quality of loving kindness.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:27.220
 Infinite bursting quality of the compassion, infinite and just radiating quality of the wisdom.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.220
 That is what it is.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:37.220
 Because of that, then the relative benefit of all beings then emanated to the other Kaya's.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:43.220
 And those are known as Sambo Gaya and Nirma Gaya's.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:56.220
 Sambo Gaya and Nirma Gaya's are translated into a minute a bit as Lumkyu Zoku and then Tripako.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.220
 All Lumkyu and Tripako. Lumkyu Zoku, Tripako.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.220
 Lumkyu Zoku, Tripako.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.220
 These two Kaya's. Two Kaya's.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:15.220
 Lumkyu Zoku, again with these great masters or translators, translated Lumkyu.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:24.220
 Lumkyu Zoku means that one who is completely luxurious, or one who has complete luxury qualities.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.220
 Luxury qualities, every aspect.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:34.220
 Or the richness, the bundleness and the richness of the infinite that college.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.220
 That who has, Sambo Gaya has.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.220
 Sambo Gaya is luxurious.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.220
 Their kind of like status is totally, everything is so perfect.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.220
 Everything is so beautiful. Everything is so inconceivable in beauties.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:55.220
 Beauty, marvelous and every aspect.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:05.220
 Blessfulness, stillness, undefided qualities. That's how reflected all the, if I say Sambo Gaya,

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:11.220
 all the environment with the five optical senses are within that status.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.220
 Every time undefided.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:19.220
 Therefore, it is sometimes translated into I think English, richness boils.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.220
 Kaya of richness. Everything is rich.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.220
 Rich says, that is the guy.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:34.220
 And that is again to summarize of that, that in the teaching said, said then five perfects.

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:46.220
 Perfect poem, perfect places, or maybe I should say perfect places, perfect poem, perfect retinas,

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.220
 and perfect time, and perfect teachings.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:59.910
 Those are five perfectness, operas for high and lighter qualities of the Sambo Gayas, the richness

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:00.220
es.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.220
 Those are the perfect places.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:13.300
 Place the way the Sambo Gaya Buddha recited is accordingly teaching is completely, completely

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.220
 beyond the dualities.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.220
 Beyond the duality.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:24.220
 That means no more samsaras, no more samsaras, beyond the dualities.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:30.220
 Therefore, everything is completely as enlightened status, and which is,

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:41.220
 known as in Sanskrit, Akanistra, in the Tibet, Homi, or the great pure land of the Homi.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:49.220
 Darmadattu, pure lands, those are the names, but reality is completely environment is,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:57.220
 everything is the wisdom status, and the union of the wisdom and the great blessfulness status.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:04.840
 All free from suffering, difficulty, trouble, getting old, and all those notions are completely

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.220
 free, all that.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:13.220
 That is the pure land of the perfect pure land of the Sambo Gaya Buddha side.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:21.750
 And then Sambo Gaya, the Sambo Gaya is what, their pickles are perfect body, perfect body, perfect

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.220
 body, poems,

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.220
 and thirty-two magical marks and eighty manual marks.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220
 Those are the teachings said.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:45.420
 And always beautiful, always beautiful, and always clear, brilliant, light, shimmering, and fresh,

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.220
 fresh,

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:54.220
 and soft, tender, and every proportion, every aspect, everything is perfect, perfect.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:37:02.220
 That is about the picture of this Sambo Gaya Buddha.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:09.220
 And then the retinas of the Sambo Gaya Buddhas are, said, all is also a higher enlightenment,

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:15.220
 enlightened bodhisattvas, tenth bodhisattvas, or higher state bodhisattvas,

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:22.220
 the bodhisattvas residing, or who achieve the highest, highest stages of the Burmese.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.220
 Burmese, all in teaching, some said, the eighth Burmese bodhisattvas,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.220
 ninth Burmese bodhisattvas, tenth Burmese bodhisattvas.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:36.220
 Those are retinas of this Sambo Gaya.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:44.220
 And teaching is also teachings, all in Mahayana teachings, Mahayana teachings.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.220
 That can be as a causal Mahayana teachings and as a result of Mahayana teachings.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:55.220
 Continually that, teaching, that is all, that is so perfect teachings.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:03.220
 And how long that teaching is lost or given is the continuation teachings, not just today.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:12.910
 As there is unending, unending teachings of the, or echoes of the song that are continually shimmer

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.220
ing

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.220
 and sizzling, resounding everywhere, all the time.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:24.220
 The perfect, highest of teachings of the true nature as it can, it is.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.220
 That is what teaching is.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:38.220
 So those are known as, as the five perfecters of the Sambo Gaya Buddhas.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.220
 And then in that, so that is really about the Sambo Gayas.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:50.220
 And then the Mahayana Buddhas are then, is appeared for the Mahayana for all the other individuals

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220
 in the teaching

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.220
 said those are who have not reached the post booming.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:03.220
 Those the Mahayana Buddhas are came again from the completion, loving kindness of the Sambo Gaya

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:10.220
 and all the Dharmakaya Buddhas appeared and then the Narmakaya Buddhas, Narmakaya Buddhas.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:17.220
 And then Mahayana is those like, there is, again, because order to benefit all living beings

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.220
 and then the Mahayana Buddhas are appeared many different forms.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.220
 Those are, there is called Supreme Narmakayas.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.220
 And then as, as, as, you know, I'll go on to that one.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:39.220
 And, and then Supreme Narmakayas and emanate, Supreme Narmakaya, emanation Narmakaya,

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:46.220
 variety Narmakaya and art Narmakayas, art, A-R-T, art Narmakayas.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:52.220
 So those are the, it's kind of like, highlight the groups of the four different Narmakayas.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.220
 And the Supreme Narmakaya is like referred as the Buddha Kshatya Mahas.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:02.220
 Who had the opportunity to be the Buddha Kshatya or Supreme Narmakaya in the teaching said,

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:09.510
 generally the teaching said, those who have capability or who have the opportunity to meet such

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.220
 this great teacher,

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:16.220
 teacher as Narmak, Supreme Narmakaya, and those are, maybe also they are already on the path,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:22.220
 already on the path, such as accumulation path and the application path there.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:27.220
 But then also in the sense of the Buddha, the Mahayana Buddha is the emanation of the compassion.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.220
 So therefore also can be to every of them.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:38.220
 So in the teaching said, in Bodhaka Kamanagi, teaching, there is so many, such audience came,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.220
 variety audience came in many different directions.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:45.220
 Not just only the human being, even the animals are attended to that.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:52.220
 So therefore, I mean, it's generally is for quite good practice, you know, but same time,

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:58.220
 those all who have fortunate and economically connected, they are able to meet me,

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:05.220
 and meet the Supreme Narmakaya and receive the teaching from this Narmakayas.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:12.220
 And then the emanation of Narmakaya, I translated as emanated Narmakaya.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:18.220
 Those emanated Narmakayas can be a quality teaching, many, many.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:24.220
 And the particular, for example, there is six emanated Buddhas in six different realms.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.220
 Those are also known as emanated Narmakayas.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.220
 And then as well as also in many times and when I get a Master's making,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:40.220
 and all this high and qualified spiritual master can be also as like blessed by the Buddhas

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.220
 to continue carry the message of the truth and the teaching and all of all this.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:52.220
 So they also can be as categorized within the birth, Narmakaya of that.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:58.220
 Because what the Chapterman said in the teaching said at the end of the generations,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:04.220
 at the end of the generations, I will claim in the form of the spiritual friend

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.220
 and I will be help and support to all of you.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.220
 Those are in the Buddha said.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.220
 So therefore, it can be also there in the teachings.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:21.220
 And the variety in the Narmakayas, then it is so many different varieties.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:28.220
 It is not necessarily always beings, but for example, trees and bridges.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:38.220
 And when we need that chakra of such trees and we need to cross the river, bridges or the boats.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:44.220
 And then all the variety things according to whatever the people needed

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:50.220
 in the Buddhas are appeared in those different forms known as variety in the Narmakayas.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:55.220
 And the art in the Narmakayas, the art then, many times in the teachings said,

00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:01.220
 those artists in them are propagated by the very great artists known as Vishukarmas.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:07.220
 But at the same time, any art, those are all that inspired

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.220
 by firing to help and bring the peace and happiness to the others.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.220
 There can be all, maybe art Narmakayas, such as those particularly,

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.220
 such as statues of the Buddha, Chakra Muni, all others are.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:28.220
 All those are painted, or those are structured, or those are casted.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:34.220
 Any of those are known as, as, then, the art Narmakayas.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:39.220
 And what is all of those is just benefiting for all the sentient beings.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.220
 So that is really about the portrayal of the Buddhas.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.220
 Thank you, okay, very much everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:54.220
 I stop here, and sorry, sorry, I'm not sorry, I think we now do many days now.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.220
 I think it will be sorry, sorry.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.220
 This is my kind of habit, sometimes it's sorry.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:04.220
 But no sorry, thank you.
