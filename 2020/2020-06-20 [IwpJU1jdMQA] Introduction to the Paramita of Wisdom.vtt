00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920
 Again, thank you very much everyone. Welcome everyone. Welcome everyone again for this evening

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:20.400
 and making time again with us. And so thank you so much everyone. Thank you very much.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.920
 Again, we're going to continue to talk on the teachings of the six Paramatas.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.850
 As we've been talking in the frame of the Neo-Tombuji teaching, the "Heart Advice for the Fortunate

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.200
 Ones"

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.960
 and the "Viki" is the essential teachings of our greatest teacher, Buddha Shatraman.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.520
 How to apply that to really more simple way to the intermediate to practice, how to put that

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.680
 practices.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.400
 So that's how we really follow with that. In that way, again, we discuss it in order to do this.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.000
 Suppose, again, we've imagined so many times, again, we're going to re-strengthen it or re-activate

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 it,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.640
 our Buddha motivation. Or it is also known as attitude. Really bring up Buddha attitude.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 Because this is something we're touching to our treasure, our beautiful qualities that make the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.480
 difference

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.000
 to our destination of these lives and the future, and as well as for some to live for other beings.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.640
 Since we are all in the old, it's practiced best upon the body together, so it's wonderful.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.360
 And therefore, again, bring more joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation more being grateful.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 Joy and appreciation of spiritual lives or eating endowments, spiritual lives.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 Not just that we have the eating endowments, but we have beautiful motivation as we discuss it.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:15.040
 Above the eating endowments, the motivation, the attention, devotion, devotion, body jhata,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 and courage and commitment, those are the poles to make meaningful of our eating endowments.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.440
 So eating endowments is not going to rest in the terrain or going to go away.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.080
 Something really we're activating, making meaningful of that, meaningful of our lives, as I said,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.060
 and also something for the others. That is what is called win-win, really, situation, win-win

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.160
 status.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.120
 Therefore, bring more joy and appreciation of what we have, what lectures, what beautiful

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.640
 opportunities, what we have. It's not just making up false statement to ourselves. Surely we have

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 that.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.880
 We are always all, always sentient beings, always all to glorify our wealth, our beautiful things,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.800
 and looking all the time something else and then missing the point. That happened so many times

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 for all of us. Therefore, reactivating that beautiful treasures, joy and appreciation,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.920
 being grateful. When we do that, that very is dharma, the heart of the dharma. With that,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 then again, trying to be let be more glorified, igniting of the body jhata, thinking of all the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.880
 living beings, really with the compassion, sincerely thinking, then may I glorify all the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:59.040
 obstacles. May I prefer my goal of enlightenment, Buddhahood, to benefit all living beings, kind of

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.800
 looking and looking forward to the beautiful goal, making commitment that I'm going to achieve that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.720
 beautiful goal, beautiful result, beautiful final destination, achievement of the enlightenment,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.600
 looking forward for the result, goal, and then being smart to that goal is not going to come by

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.720
 itself. We have to activate, we have to prepare the perfect cause and the conditions and that is

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:40.080
 then six parameters. Cause and the conditions to gain, to fulfill that goal of the Buddhahood,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.560
 that beautiful result, that fruit. To gain that fruit, perfect fruit, we have to prepare and make

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.080
 smart with that cause that will line up with that. That is what is known as in gracious teaching,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.360
 Bhadakshat community, interdependent coordination, the interdependent coordination, everything is

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.920
 connected. If there is a right cause and right conditions, it will bring right result. If there

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.480
 is a wrong cause and a wrong conditions, it will bring wrong result. If you want to get something

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:30.800
 good, never come. It's impossible. It's lined up that. So being smart to ourself, preparing the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:40.480
 beautiful cause and conditions to achieve the beautiful goal of the Buddhahood, that is all

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:50.320
 the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas said in the past is six parameters. All the linear masters, it is six

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.960
 parameters. And all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who are practicing now or who reach enlightenment,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.270
 reaching enlightenment, they went on the path of the six parameters. And all the Buddhas and Bodhis

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.720
attvas

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.800
 who will come in the future, they are continually advancing, pursuing that beautiful path, this

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:23.040
 beautiful path of the six parameters. Thinking of the goal of enlightenment, bodhahood. Therefore,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.200
 that's what we really discuss according to our capabilities, trying to bring the understanding

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.440
 of that six parameters so that we can activate it and stay, really stay in the lines

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:44.640
 perfectly, beautifully, we line up that, not making pause, not kind of treating our own self.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.000
 That is what really six parameters is. So that we are in the heart of the enlightenment.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.040
 All Buddhas teachings, like all the Buddhas teachings are within the six parameters,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.960
 particularly Māyāna teachings, all is within the six parameters. Paramata, even Dzogchī

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.960
 or Mahamudra teachings also lined up with six parameters. So this is the heart, essence

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.320
 of the, of the really the practice of the, all the practices of the Buddhism. Buddhism. And

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.040
 therefore,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:32.480
 again, we continue discussing and following this, to remind ourselves that we already know,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.280
 this is the teaching from many great masters and reflect those memories some during that and those

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.680
 people who not heard these things, this is the what really Buddhism is best on the six parameters.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.880
 It is that six parameters that is, again, we do come more kind of more simple way. It is

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.360
 love and kindness, compassion and resistance. Everything that more down to the kind, again,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.840
 more simple way, it is compassion. Compassion for all living beings, without any discriminations,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.720
 without any expectations, without any kind of any strings behind the compassion activities,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:24.640
 freely, openly radiating every direction, a core incompatibility of the both by the practitioners.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.520
 That is known as the following the path of the Buddha, the greatest teacher,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:40.210
 Buddha Shātamuni, and as well as all Bodhisattvas, all the linear masters. That's what it is. That

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:40.320
's

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.120
 it. So with this understanding, again, we're going six parameters. Now, so far, what we've been

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:55.280
 discussing, we've been went through the old five parameters, generous the parameter, as well as

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:06.000
 morality parameter, and patient parameter, and your effort parameter, and concentration parameters.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.920
 We went those one after another, really, kind of precisely trying to bring up the clarities of each

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.840
 of the meanings that we can apply and so we can understand how we can pursue continuous that.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:29.760
 And today, we're going to show a word of Pāṇḍa parameter, or wisdom parameter in English,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:38.800
 wisdom parameter. In it, it is known as Śrīrāpya pārutu cambha, Śrīrāpya pārutu sambha.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:46.960
 That we will discuss now. Now, to discuss again Pāṇḍa parameter, or Śrīrāpya pārutu sambha

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:46.960
,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.680
 or wisdom parameter, again, we did same way as other parameters. First five parameters,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:03.600
 we will do that same way. First is the word of the Pāṇḍa parameter, then the identity or the

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.440
 meaning of the Pāṇḍa parameters, then benefit of the Pāṇḍa parameters, and then as

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.360
 division

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.080
 of the Pāṇḍa parameters, or the wisdom parameters. So those are we're going to discuss.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.680
 We go over that. We go through, trying to go through that, or I try to go through these.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:33.440
 Now, the first is Pāṇḍa parameter, that you owe or maybe owe, heard so many times.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:42.000
 Pārutya and parameter, parameters, or sāska word. That is sāska word. And in English,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 it is translated, I think, wisdom transcendental, transcendental practice of the wisdom.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.960
 That is Pāṇḍa parameter. In the Tibetan, as I already said, and many of you already know that,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:11.040
 and our world meaning of the śirā means supreme wisdom, śirā. All old men,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:21.760
 wistoms. She means the wisdom or the knowledge, rāp means the old men, the ultimate, ultimate

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:33.040
 wistoms. So that is, that is the old meaning of the wisdom or earthly wistoms.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:46.960
 Wistoms. And now, paramata. Paramata is translated into English, transcendental, I think. And I

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.120
 think

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:57.360
 you know better than me what worta means. But in it, Pārutya cimpa means the wisdom that goes

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:09.600
 beyond or the wisdom that goes to other show. That is śirāpya pārutya cimpa. Other show means

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:09.920
 what?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:24.270
 Other show of the dualities. This wisdom will lead us beyond duality or other show of the dualities

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.480
.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:36.870
 All the others, whatever we do practices, if still within the show or within this side of the dual

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.360
ity,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:50.080
 side of the dualities. But the wisdom, paramata, it will lead us beyond the show of the dualities.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.280
 And that, again, to know more kind of, there will be more kind of details or clarification,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:05.200
 what is in the teaching set. This Pārutya paramata will lead beyond the show of samsara

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:17.600
 and the nirvana. Beyond the show of samsara and nirvana. What that means? The show of the nirvana

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:27.840
 is like the nirvana of the Pārutya Buddha and the hirvakas. That is the show of nirvana.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:37.200
 This is, again, in the teaching set, called the Mahayana point, where it is one side. Again, it's

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:50.720
 partiality nirvana. Because it was clinging or attached and it desired and it stayed with nirvana.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.320
 What means nirvana? Again, in Sanskrit world, of course, many of you already know.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:07.120
 Nirvana means free from the sufferings. Free from the sufferings. Free from the suffering of the

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:17.760
 cause and the sufferings. So that means what? Actually, it means beyond the cause of suffering

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:27.280
 truth and suffering truth. When it's beyond the suffering truth and the cause of suffering truth,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:35.840
 then no more sufferings. Then what state that is known as? Peaceful. Nirvana means peaceful status.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:46.560
 So you are attached in a way, desired to stay within the state of that peaceful status,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:53.840
 where there is no more trouble of suffering and cause of suffering truth. That means no emotions,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.720
 no calmness. Therefore, there is no emotion, no karma. Therefore, there is no result of the

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:09.440
 karma and emotions, that which is suffering. See, according to the point of the Mahayana,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:17.760
 that is just one side. You glued, in a way, attached to be your own pleasure or peaceful.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.440
 In a way, according to the Mahayana point of view, you can't really, in a way, can't really

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:33.360
 ignore all the rest of beings who are struggling with the karma and emotions

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.040
 and challenges and difficulties. What about that? And so you're not caring about that too

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.160
 much about that. And you're going to like to be peaceful state myself. And you don't have to become

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:56.160
 peaceful status, as I said, have to be free from the cause and conditions. If there is cause and

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.600
 condition continually, even temporary may be peaceful, then there is activated again,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.240
 difficulty, and suffering and difficulties. Cause of suffering is, as we discussed earlier,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:16.800
 and you all know, is negative emotions and it is activity, karma. Everywhere,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:24.320
 early, and you all know, in the teachings of the Mudro, and all that, this is

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:35.760
 negative emotion is the very cause of the karma. Karma is the activity of the negative emotions.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:43.920
 That creates the karma. And then it continues, the chain of the continuation, unceasing,

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:54.560
 suffering, troubles, difficulties, challenges, disappointments, and all goes on and on.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.120
 That will be being continually from the beginning of this time until now, according to the greatest

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:10.000
 teacher, the Buddha Shaktam and his teacher, we've been. As long as with the cause and condition,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.640
 or the karma and the emotions, suffering and difficulty never going to end. It's going to show up.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:28.000
 That is, it's just like shadow. They're never going to help finish the shadow as long as we

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.360
 have the body. Tangible this body. Same way it will fall. So, kind of free from that negative

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.240
 emotion and the karma, karma and suffering, and staying in the peaceful status, that is known as

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:52.000
 then the one side of the duality. Again, it is still according to Mahayan point of view,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:02.800
 it is self-interest. So, the great bodhisattvas, the one who follows the path of the Mahayana,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.280
 or the bodhisattva, when they develop the bodhisattva, not thinking one's own important

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:17.840
 and interestless. That's what we discussed, the poor boneless. We discussed about the dungli

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.560
 practices,

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.960
 dagi nyamba, davi yinji, and then

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:39.360
 jine, dali yinji. Those are all we discussed in a simple way, but equalizing, first equalizing,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:47.760
 second is exchanging, third is others are more important than ourselves. Why that attitude is

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.600
 coming? Because of the bodhisattva, because of compassion, loving-kindness, the wisdom.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:04.560
 That's what the beautiful selfishness attitude of that pre-beautiful thoughts

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:14.960
 arising from the deep of our heart and the mind. Therefore, so that bodhisattva is not

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:23.840
 strong, not going to stay and longing to be in just the peaceful one's own self, going beyond.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:31.680
 Then, bodhisattva is also not going. That is the same, bodhisattva and as well as

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:40.080
 sharaka, not staying in samsara. Having stayed in samsara, we cannot help to all the sentient

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.720
 beings

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:47.680
 as we want. Because we are now in samsara, even we have a good heart, a good intention, we like to

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:55.200
 help all the beings. We don't have really capabilities. Our capabilities, abilities,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.720
 all limited. So, therefore, going beyond of the samsara, going beyond of the nirvana,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:14.880
 that is known as, then, the great nirvana status. So, therefore, this pañjaparamata,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:22.560
 pañjaparamata, going beyond, beyond of the nirvana and beyond of the samsara.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.680
 What that said is, the great Mahaparin nirvana in the teaching said, Mahaparin nirvana,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:40.640
 it is beyond both samsara and nirvana status. That is really the pañjaparamata.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.440
 Now, we think about the world meaning of the pañjaparamata. Pañjaparamata,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:56.000
 I am talking now, pañjaparamata. Pañjaparamata is supreme wisdom in Tibet. It is the great

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.080
 translators in eight centuries. Those emanation translators and panditas of the Indian masters,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.840
 they translated the pañjaparamata into the Tibetan language, the new language at that time,

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:18.000
 translated as shira. And as they said, shira means supreme wisdom. She is

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:28.320
 wisdom, also knowledge, intelligence, smart. That produces rap, ultimate wisdom,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:35.600
 ultimate knowledge, ultimate smart, smartness, ultimate intelligence.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.040
 That is wisdom. And what that's translated, sometimes in English, I think translated

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:52.480
 discernment. Discernment, knowledge, that understanding, the discernment of all the

00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:00.960
 phenomena, both subject and object. Clearly, again, if I use a simple word,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.440
 in my own kind of consumption, simple word, the knowledge or the wisdom that understand

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:17.840
 clearly, exactly where things are in both subject and object, without again, without any ups and

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:31.120
 downs. All that means exaggerations, and as well as what sometimes I say, and the deprecations

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:43.520
 or decreased, increased, decreased. Just as simple truth as it is. That is what is known as

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:50.880
 versatile. That is versatile. Both subject and object, exactly where things are at,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:23:01.200
 where things it is, where things are. Seeing that, clearly that. So it's simple. It's not something

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:10.640
 kind of fancy or something that extraordinary or mysteries. It's simple. Simple statement, plain,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:24.080
 direct, and casual. No things are as it is. Not making up anything, or making up so much,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:34.320
 or decreasing so much, not making up. That is known as a versatile. Discriminating a wellness,

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:42.560
 or discernment, discernment, I think, discernment to all the phenomena, both subject and object,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:55.600
 or ultimately seeing where things are as it is. That is versatile. Now, so that is about the whole

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:05.120
 meaning of the versatile. Now, benefit of the versatile, there is many, or two I will say,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:15.920
 and as we went, as a great master, Maitrya mentioned in his teaching, as in the Sutra

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.360
 Alankara. All of it is the Buddha teaching too, the great Buddha Shakyamun is teaching, that is

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:21.840
 what

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:32.680
 he glorified, which is a force. And his force is that wisdom, once you have the wisdom, what it

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:32.880
 does,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:44.960
 it will dispel the opposite of wisdom. What is the opposite of the wisdom? It's ignorance.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:55.760
 When you have the wisdom, it will dispel ignorance. So, ignorance won't be occupied 100%.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:04.320
 As much as we develop the wisdom, that much ignorance goes away. If we develop the wisdom 10%,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:15.600
 our ignorance from 100% now becomes 90%. If we develop the wisdom 20%, our ignorance goes on

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:24.560
 again 20%, decreases 20%, 30%. And if we develop the wisdom as 100%, the ignorance will go away.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:35.040
 That's what it really does. It's completely demolishing, erasing, and removing the opposite

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:42.880
 of the versatile. Then, what it will bring? When you have the understanding of the wisdom,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.600
 it will lead us beyond the duality, as I said earlier. Second is, it really leads us

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:59.440
 beyond the duality. It becomes the paramatas. It will lead us beyond the show of the duality,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:09.040
 about samsara, and the nirvana. Then, it will fulfill all the wishes.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:18.000
 When we develop the wisdom, it will fulfill my wish, or one's own wish, and the wishes of others,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.200
 it will happen. So, that is the third benefit. And the fourth benefit,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:34.640
 wisdom, it will lead all the one who's connected to that wisdom, it will lead according to their

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:42.960
 designated destinations. What that means? That is generally all the same, all the six paramatas,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:50.160
 or five paramatas we were, is the same. Designated destinations. That means, according to the

00:26:50.160 --> 00:27:00.640
 program, there are three desires of the groups of the individuals. Some groups desire to get

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:10.080
 arahatahood, realizations. Some groups like to get their desires to achieve the

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.800
 perfect Buddhahood. And some groups of the beings like to get enlightenment, Buddhahood.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:23.360
 So, there are three groups, in a way, that will divide the whole Buddhist practitioners

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:34.320
 into three groups. So, this wisdom will lead and connect to their final desired destinations.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:42.480
 Those who like to be by this wisdom, those who like to be, be rich in arahatahood as a sharaka,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.400
 it will connect to the sharaka, yanas. Those who like to reach the enlightenment, such as

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:55.200
 realization of the perfect Buddha, the wisdom will connect to the perfect Buddha realization,

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.960
 levels, or to that, that path. And those who like to reach enlightenment as a Buddhahood,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:10.640
 or bodhisattva, great bodhisattva, it will connect to them. So, it will follow their final

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:19.200
 spiritual goals, spiritual vision, kusit, I think. It will really fulfill them. So, those are

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:28.960
 known as benefits as highlighted by the great master, material, or asangas. Asangas.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:37.840
 Now, so that, now, we talk about what is special of these Pandya parameters,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.680
 these six parameters. What is special of the six parameters, among all the other parameters?

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:53.440
 This parameter, the sixth parameter, is the ultimate parameter. In fact, in the teaching

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.560
 sense, this generally, again, what in the teaching sense, great master's analogy in the teaching,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:09.600
 the good things in this life, good things in the future life, all is relied on the wisdom.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:21.200
 Those who like to be good things at this time and the next lifetime, they should always

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:29.840
 increase, dribble up the wisdom. Within this lifetime, the poor bundances,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:37.520
 poor bundances of the perfect, perfect bundances are also relying on the wisdom.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.240
 These poor bundances, maybe, again, many, of course, many of you know, but few of you don't

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:52.720
 know what are poor bundances. In a debate, "ponsam sokwe devya," bundance of the dharma,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:02.720
 bundance of the wealth, bundance of the desire object, bundance of the realization or the

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:13.520
 nirvana, or the liberation. Those are poor bundances. In the Buddha teaching, mentioned

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:22.880
 in the samsara, people longing for that, this poor desire. Fourth is what? Dharma,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:30.640
 that means people need spiritual bundances. Material wealth alone will not further go

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:42.000
 happiness. Spiritual is so important. Those who like to be decent, average, well-being of

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:51.440
 people in this world, you need spiritual, spiritual. Again, for that reason, many great

00:30:51.440 --> 00:31:00.880
 masters in the teaching said they should have beliefs. Belief is good. There are good beliefs,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:13.280
 practical beliefs. Believe on the goodness, lowing kindness, compassion, and believe on the heart,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:22.960
 call it. Something benefit, something nice, brain peace, almonies, good things. That is spiritual,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:31.680
 compassion, respect and appreciation to the others, those all known as spirituals. Then above that,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.880
 the whole Buddhism, all the beautiful teachings that you have, have you heard the bundance?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:46.160
 That makes life more rich, truly really rich. You're not missing one quarter of missing half

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:55.600
 kind of part of their lives. Always stay full, nice. So that is really the bundance of the dharma

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.680
 or the spiritual. In the bundance of the wealth is all the wealth of samsaras.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:11.680
 That is then, I think, simple. Bundance, wealth. Bundance of the desires. What that means?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:21.120
 How much desire we need? What we have? We have five senses, eyes, senses of eye,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:29.280
 sense of the ear, sense of our tongue or nose and body. Those are the five senses.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.760
 Above that, six senses of the mind. Five or six senses. We sentient beings are always

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:46.560
 learning from the pleasure object of these six senses. Six senses. We always look. So there is

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:56.560
 enough equipment, facilities, support of the six senses or five senses. That is known as

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:09.120
 abundance of the desires. Desires. Then third or fourth one, the abundance of the liberations or

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:16.170
 the nirvanas. Some degree from thinking of because you have the spiritual belief, spiritual

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.120
 abundance,

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:26.640
 therefore looking for something better situation in the future that which we don't see now.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:37.840
 We don't see now. Our life now is now. But these days the future according Buddhism,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.280
 that we really don't see. But however, that future is dependent

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:54.480
 with now. It's all connected, interdependent, interdependent.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:02.800
 Yesterday or today, here we are today. Even though we don't see tomorrow,

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:11.680
 what we presumed is going to come. It will have to be going good tomorrow. Today is so important.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.600
 Today plays a big role of the brightness of the tomorrow.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.040
 Same way in Buddhism, according to the greatest teacher, Buddha Yaccha Kaman is teaching,

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:33.520
 ever like to be seen. How beyond unseen are presumptions? Like to be good. Do good things now.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:41.280
 It really well reflects. So therefore, liberations, something looking forward.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:47.920
 In a way, you invest in it. You went investment for the future. Go from now.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.360
 In a way, what's called? Now we do what? In modern countries, those are retirement

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.840
 problems, patient problems, patient problems. We don't know it's going to happen on those things,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:09.920
 but we make that plan. And then when it happens, it benefits the same way.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:19.520
 Doing something good things for our future destination, unseen destination. That is called

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:26.880
 abundance of the preparing of the liberations or the nirvanas. Those are the full abundance. Also,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:35.920
 therefore, abundance is reliant upon the Muslims. Muslims all commonly sense knowledge,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:44.160
 common sense understanding. For that reason, wisdom is so, so important. For this life,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:51.610
 for next life. And then for this paramatas, again we're talking about continuing now about paramat

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:51.920
as.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:36:00.960
 Paramatas, we went five paramatas. But five paramatas, if there is no wisdom,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:13.040
 five paramatas will not walk. It's not going to walk. Look to every detail of the paramatas,

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:23.440
 generosity, moralities, patience, joy of effort, concentration. Every paramatas guided by the

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:33.440
 Muslims. Every paramatas is guided, supported, lead, and made perfect of the paramatas by

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:41.360
 Muslims. For that reason, Greg's teacher, Brother Shatir Muni said in the Pandya Paramata teaching,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:50.960
 "Sesayim Gathas." No dupas in it, but no dupas. If there is no Pandya Paramatas, the six paramatas,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:37:03.940
 six paramatas, all the five paramatas, first five paramatas are the blind. B-L-I-N-D, they're blind

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.080
.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:13.280
 They cannot go further. But when you have the paramata, Pandya Paramata, then you have the

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:24.880
 wisdom, "I," "I" that will lead all the other paramatas to the destinations. So therefore,

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:33.840
 Pandya Paramata is the eyes of the six paramatas, first five paramatas, paramatas.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:42.480
 And for that reason, same reason, Great Master Chander Kriti said in his teachings, said it,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:51.920
 "For example, if these five blind persons, they cannot go to the cities very well. But if they

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:58.960
 have some guide of the one man that will lead, they will go easily to all the cities, all that

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:10.080
 in the cities." Same way, this Pandya Paramata will lead all the five paramatas to the city of the

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:17.280
 Nirvana, the sweet city of the enlightenment. And again, in the Pandya Paramata teachings by the

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:23.900
 Buddha, the great teacher, Buddha Hekke Munu said, "He called to Subhuti, Ramayana in a little bit

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:24.000
."

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.600
 Ramayana is in Subhuti. "For example, all the rivers in the world," that's what in the teachings

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:41.600
 he said, "but when all the rivers in Asia," maybe now, "Asia will join to the river Ganges, and

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:41.920
 then

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:50.640
 river Ganges with those all waters will go to the ocean." Similarly, all the paramatas of five will

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.960
 join to the Pandya Paramata, and then Pandya Paramata will go to the ocean of the enlightenment.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:07.760
 Yes. So therefore, the Pandya Paramata is really the eye and "A" or the feet of all the paramatas.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:17.840
 With all the Pandya Paramatas, all the paramatas will not activate it. Yes. And again, in the

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:27.520
 teachings, the great master of art, Aditya said. Pandya Paramata, what is it, again, as we, I

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.080
 mentioned

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:35.680
 earlier, and you of course, you all know that, that all the paramatas can be summarized in the

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:44.720
 three extraordinary trainings. Those are the morality extraordinary trainings, concentration

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:54.080
 extraordinary trainings, and wisdom extraordinary teachings. Teachings, that's all. But also now,

00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:04.560
 Paramata, all these paramatas, all these paramatas can be summarized into two, which is known as

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:15.200
 skillful means and wisdoms. Skillful means and wisdoms. Skillful means and wisdoms, all the five

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:26.160
 paramatas are the skillful means. What that means, generous paramata, morality paramata,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:35.760
 and patient paramata, and joyful effort paramatas, concentration paramatas

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:49.280
 is all skillful means. And also this wister paramata is wister, skillful means and wisdoms.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:57.920
 These, also these two paramatas can be summarized, another way it can be, it is two accumulation

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:06.240
 merits. Accumulation merit, wister merit. Sorry, I shouldn't say two accumulation. This, also this

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:14.960
 can be summarized into two merits, merit. Accumulation merit and wister merit. What are

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:26.560
 those two merits? How we divide that? And again, first four or five paramatas can be as

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:34.480
 accumulation merits. Last one, the sixth paramata, sixth one is Muslim paramatas.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.440
 Or sometimes it can be divided like these ways, it's just a slightly different.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:50.800
 Said, first three are the accumulation merits. Last two are, two paramatas are

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.480
 wister merits. And the fourth one is the support to both merits,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:04.480
 merits. And that I think you know, we are American so many times. That means joyful effort is

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:04.960
 support

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:15.360
 to the accumulation merits and wister merits, must merit. So it can summarize that. So therefore,

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:23.120
 again, what in the great mass, and as the buddha shaktamuni and the atisha, all that in the

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.520
 teaching

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.320
 said, I mean it's not just the atisha and that, but I say in the teaching there are so many great

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:35.280
 masters again, again to glorify, reactivate and remind to us again and again that. What in the

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:44.640
 teaching said, if only the skillful means will lead to the enlightenment? No. Only the wister alone

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:52.560
 will lead to the enlightenment, buddha hood? No. Both have to have. Skillful means that

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.840
 wisdom both have to have, together, as a union. And to merit, the one alone merit will not lead

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:06.400
 to the buddha hood. Enlightenment have to be union. Akumala ye merit, wister merit be union.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:18.400
 What in the teaching said, by the compassion you are out of,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:31.040
 by the compassion you are out of the nirvanas. By wisdom you are out of the samsaras.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:43.760
 By wisdom alone will not reach enlightenment or buddha hood. It will be wisdom lead as to the,

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:50.160
 as nirvana will be discussed, nirvana of the sharvaka, nirvana of aparthi buddha.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:44:00.240
 That is not final destination. By compassion, alone will not reach enlightenment.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:09.520
 Enlightenment again and that goes then, that's why again compassion and wisdom are

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:20.560
 need, union, state, target, unions. So those are the, what, so therefore these two, two skillful

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:28.960
 means and wisters are needed and akumala ye merit are needed, then it really will become,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:41.120
 become as perfect cause to the enlightenment. Enlightenment again by the compassion

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:48.880
 will not stay in the nirvana, by the wisdom not will stay in the samsara.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:45:00.620
 So samsara, this wisdom will take you beyond samsara and compassion will take you beyond the nir

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.120
vana

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:09.920
 and then both skillful means and wisdom will take us the nirvana of the great Mahaparin nirvana

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.480
 state

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:20.480
 in the brotherhood states. So therefore this wisdom is so important. At the beginning is important,

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:27.840
 immediately is important, at the end is important and that is my brief talk about the wisdoms and
