00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 How many times in the teaching said, "Ganacheka is so special, Ganacheka is so powerful."

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.700
 And similarly, all the great masters, Dene, Gorokhema Samye Ling, Vasna Rakhini, Hinsodya, Surya,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.280
 as well as Vasna Rakhini, Maathik, Lathitoma, everyone said, "Ganacheka is so special, so powerful

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.400
,"

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.100
 means to increase rapidly, quickly, of the true merit, merit, and remove the obstacles,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 the obstacles or the equities. So this act is what the Ganacheka is, it's very, very special.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.200
 And then with this understanding, when we do the Ganacheka, of course, we have to set up

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.100
 Sharayam, Sharayam of the mandalas. And this is our mandala. For example, here we have the mandala.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.700
 When we speak of mandala, generally we call Pema Samye Ling. Pema Samye Ling itself is really mand

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.300
ala.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.500
 I'm not just saying this. I feel that. And here we say it many times. It is, the entire itself,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.170
 is living mandala, not just the immediate, small mandala, but it is truly sizzling, lively mandalas

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.500
.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.870
 Look, this is all that you look to. Right direction, left direction, front, back, everywhere you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.500
 look,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 there is so many brutal things that symbolize the law, and the compassion, and the wisdom,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.500
 and the skilled means, and the Muslims that represent it. All these, look everywhere.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 Every corner you look, every side you look, is all. The backside, the upside, the monastery,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 inside the monastery, up and down, everywhere. This is the true living mandala.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 It is truly one of the central spot of the pilgrimage, pilgrimage, not just as, like as one of the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.900
 retreat centers,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 but it's truly one of the very beautiful pilgrimage, sinterling, living, linear mandala support.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.460
 It's true. And then generally we're talking about this land itself, and of course, in the Buddha

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.100
 teaching set,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100
 there is so many, and as well as in the Buddha teaching set, so many times.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.900
 There is also, of course, artists generally, everywhere they speak, but there is also in the Buddha

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.100
 teaching set,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100
 and as well as in the Buddha teaching set, and as well as in the Buddha teaching set,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 there is unco-contour support of the earth. Therefore, at great cemeteries, and in 24 major sports,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 anywhere they are, in 32 sports, so forth. There is many unco-contour points on the earth.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.100
 Earth, and earth is generally, there also is one way, is kind of saying that, but art is also

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 living, living.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.270
 The elements are living. It's a display of the wisdom, and therefore, art has many unco-contour

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.100
 points.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:16.790
 Definitely. And then, with that contrast, truly Vemmasavel is one of the, also we feel, unco-cont

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.100
our points of the earth.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:27.230
 And we also heard from the ancient time, native prophecy. This idea is very, very special places in

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.100
 the native prophecy.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.710
 And whatever that reason, in the external level, also we look here in this place. For example, I'm

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.100
 not saying only here,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:45.100
 but it is it is, all areas. There is, and generally everywhere there is, is so many, what's called,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:57.280
 poison iris, and the poison snacks, and the mosquitoes. Vemmasavel, really, I'm not saying you all

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.100
 know.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:06.100
 There's very less. Maybe mosquitoes sometimes come, but there's no poison iris, no poison snacks.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:15.100
 And then, many people, we all imagine, first time when we came here, no many mosquitoes, too.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 But otherwise, everywhere there's so many mosquitoes. Everywhere. Even far, it's far northern, in

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 Canada,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:31.100
 which is like our way to the north, there's mosquitoes. In the latter words. But here, very less.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.620
 Musketo, all those disturbance, they stand there. Then here, what you often say, this latter

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.100
 formation has so many beautiful things.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.530
 Things. When you look to the astrological level, when you look into it. To the east side, is the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.100
 most kind of order.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.290
 And that should be like that. And the soul is very kind of full. And many say, in front of the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.100
 monastery,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.100
 if you build something, if you want to stay at something, if you look into the front, if there is

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 formation of that,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.100
 there are actually many hips. Truly, when you look to here, so many mountain peaks, you see.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.100
 It's like the hip of the jewel. Truly, Rana qualities. Rana's our qualities.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.100
 And also, when you say, this mountain formation looks like a sleeping elephant.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 So sleeping elephant was carrying the full load of the jewels. Like that.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:36.250
 And then west has beautiful formation. Again, formation that is always said, should be as like peac

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.100
ocks.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.320
 Peacocks, paddies. But it has good, good spot in the west. And not the back side, which has, then

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.100
 again, very majestic kind of, standing back side.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 Stay is very, staying as the opening, you say, like tortoise. Tortoise, but it has good formation.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.580
 When you look, when we do the ceremony of the fire video on the lower middle, looking up here,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.100
 truly, it has semicircle formation.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.100
 Comes very good. And then in the center of the, this is also a tort, tutu.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:24.100
 And Varanasi is so special place in Buddhism. And as well as hip is Varanasi.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:34.940
 It has, why name is Varanasi? It's named because there is two rivers, called Varuna and Asi, two

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.100
 rivers.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.290
 When Varuna, Asi, yon trogade, put trogade at two walls, and it's according to Sanskrit language,

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.100
 conjuncture, or the Sanskrit they call, conjunct, then it becomes Varanasi.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:55.330
 So it's a bit of a two rivers. In the penmasal learning, there is not two rivers, but there is two

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.100
 blocks.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:03.100
 What's called blocks? Blocks, long blocks, trogade blocks.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:14.100
 We have two blocks. When you pick up the, from these two rivers, we can pick up lotus, almost.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:23.940
 Lotus, L-O-T-U-S, or you can pick up that. So in Sanskrit, the Varanasi, they pick it up from the

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.100
 Varuna and Asi, Varanasi.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:33.100
 So I thought we can pick up, like, from these two blocks, lotus.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:43.230
 Then N, maybe S, S can become lotus. So then through penmasal learning, what means? Penma means lot

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.100
us, that you all know.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:55.050
 So there is some degree of the lotus, lotus, and so that's also kind of naturally came, that some

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.100
 degree of the terminology of lotus.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:05.100
 Those are just made up by us only.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.770
 But then, in the teaching set, when you put that, spread your meditative heart, and blend from it

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.100
 in hands,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:20.390
 spread like acid, like montage, it looks like city, rishi, in samadhi, samadhi, all the Buddha, V

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.100
eroja.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:29.910
 If you put on the monastery or the helmetry, or the rishi cabin, on that lap, lap of that, then it

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.100
's really very good in the teaching set.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:42.520
 So when you look at this mountain, I think penmasal is called things, maybe this red looks like, or

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.100
 mostly like, kind of like meditation postures.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:56.100
 And penmasal learning is, the temple itself is kind of almost in the lap of that.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.630
 And the lower part is like on a cushion, and this part is there, and this part of the top, this

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.100
 mountain area is kind of like part of the body up there.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:16.100
 So that can be interpreted that way. So that way, also it has that good quality set.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:23.100
 Then, of course, this temple is named after Sami.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:32.100
 Sami represents the entire Buddha teaching. It represents all cosmos of teaching.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:38.100
 So this has, I'm not going to go into more details now, but this has three levels.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.890
 And then also Sami is a core in the teaching, that when they build, they build up a core

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.100
 independence of the total.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.100
 Total, they built. Sami wants to build.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:59.100
 And we don't have the exact level, but our, the core part is, is like total formations.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.100
 It is octagons. Octagons, it is in total formation.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:10.720
 It is, in one way, at the university, you all know, it is itching in the harmonizing, itching state

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.100
.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.100
 It's an octagon, octagon status. And then we put so many, those lotus patterns.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.100
 Those symbolized, and the Buddha, when Buddha was born, Buddha was still born.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.100
 Born, he stepped in seven, seven each direction, and on each direction, and there is lotus came,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.100
 each direction.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:36.100
 So there is 20, 28 lotus patterns, going around the head.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:42.620
 And then there is a big three lotus, all coming up the head pattern, and which symbolize the Buddha

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.100
's body, speed mind.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:53.100
 Over a quarter in the teaching, it symbolized Hinai, Mahayana, and Vaidhyana teachings.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.100
 And that is all adds to us. And five Dayana Buddhas.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:06.100
 So truly, Pemasamyam itself is really like sizzling, living, madhava, many aspects.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:12.100
 And then in library, we have all the Buddha's teachings, teachings in Kanjur and Danyu, of course,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.100
 Vedas.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:19.330
 But we have also Theravada, and the Chinese version of the Therapeuticas, and so many other, all

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.100
 those Buddha teachings.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:29.090
 It's filled with that. And so therefore, this Pemasamyam is truly, is like living, madhava, and as

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.100
 I said, is truly, is one of the peregrine sports.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:41.100
 It's not just temple, or the history center, but truly, it represents so beautiful.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:47.500
 Also this temple, and everything came, so quite beautiful. It's not so startling so much all the

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.100
 time.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:54.790
 But with true love and compassion, joy, everyone's, and put together, truly bought as monumental

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.100
 love and compassion, joy and devotion and appreciation.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.820
 Therefore, from the top to bottom, to every aspect, this is really truly like optical ventilation

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.100
 and madhava.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.100
 So this is generally madhava.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.100
 And now we talk about the inside.
