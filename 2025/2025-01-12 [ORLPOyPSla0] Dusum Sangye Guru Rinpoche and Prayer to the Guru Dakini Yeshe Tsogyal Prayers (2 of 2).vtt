00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Thank you.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Again, I'd just like to say welcome everyone.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Thank you very much for participating.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:09.520
 Thank you very much, everyone, for giving me this opportunity to be with you all together and

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.000
 organizing, arranging so many different -- our close, my friends, are really preparing these things

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.000
.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 So I'm very thankful and grateful to all of you.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Thank you.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Today we continue to again the teachings on the Tushum Sani Guru Rinpoche.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 That which is according to the teachings of the great Master, first Chinsi.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 That taught his students.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.420
 And that is again received to his Holiness, Dhunur Rinpoche, from his Master, who was disciple of

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:55.690
 the first Chinsi, first Kuntur, and Dhunur Rinpoche, the former predecessor of his Holiness, Dhunur

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.000
 Rinpoche.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Many of you, I'm sure you all know his Holiness, Dhunur Rinpoche.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.880
 Japji Dhunur Rinpoche. Japji Dhunur Rinpoche was one of the great Masters, great teacher, great bod

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:19.000
hisattva, and one of the great region and emissaries of the Gurba Masambhava in the 20th century.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 He was great at the teachings. He was also family, very, very family man, and humble and simple.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 But his knowledge and realizations are just so magnificent.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Even though he don't really present that I am this and that I know this, he's so humble.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 But yet, his presence, his knowledge, his love, and kindness, the comparison is just invaluable.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.570
 That all many beings who connect they know. He become the Master of so many great Masters, one

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.000
 after the other.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 So this is what his teachings. And we all connect with his great Masters, one way or the other.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Maybe he didn't meet that his presence, but yet there are so many of his disciples.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 And that all carried his message and teaching.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 That message of him is not something different than Buddha Chakra Muni and Gurba Masambhava.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Essence of teachings of those that he really presents.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So today, again, we are following one of whose great light that he shines to us.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And we are trying to observe that. And so we can connect strongly to Gurba Masambhava.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Who is the Buddha of the degeneration? Buddha of this era, this time, this present moment.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 All the situation and circumstances are really so many different things happen.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.160
 I think there is nothing we can do more than invoke the power and the blessings and kindness of the

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.000
 Gurba Masambhava.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 That can dispel the obstacles and difficulties that challenge ourselves to our family members,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 our fellow citizens, and all the beings of the six realms.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 It is also an activity practice of our bodhichetas.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yesterday, we discussed three lines. I think basically three lines.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Which represent as you all know. And today, I think maybe you have the English version.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 English version is translated, available from the north of our house.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 So we got this, I'm sure you all have that copy.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 And you can look through that. We discussed yesterday, three, first three lines.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 That, I think we discussed that, first three lines.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.530
 First three lines are explaining the realization and call it an achievement of who is Gurba Masambh

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.000
ava.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Why I'm saying who is? Gurba Masambhava is not past, nor is future.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 He is living Buddha right now. Right now.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Gurba Masambhava is also, of course, we are talking now Gurba Masambhava as third person.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.940
 But actually, right if we have devotion, if we have the concentration, Gurba Masambhava is right in

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.000
 front of us.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 So we are speaking our own, call it our own great masters.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 To each other, so that we can better understand, so we can connect it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Gurba Masambhava is our teacher and represent all the teachers so that we connect it. Really.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.670
 So therefore, we are talking and we are explaining and following the teaching of his own Dhanjil R

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.000
ambaju or the first chancy.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.190
 First great chancy and this Dharma teaching is rewarded by, as you already said, you all know, is

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.000
 Choyol Dhekin Langkwa.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.840
 We are exploring the greatness and kindness, compassion, realization, the achievement of the Gurba

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.000
 Masambhava.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 He is Buddha of all the times, as I mentioned, as we know.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Gurba Masambhava is Buddha, Gurba Masambhava is Dharma, Gurba Masambhava is Sangha.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Gurba Masambhava is Guru, Gurba Masambhava is Yadav, Gurba Masambhava is Dakini in Dharmavara.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Gurba Masambhava is Dharmakaya, Gurba Masambhava is Sambokaya, Gurba Masambhava is Nirmakaya.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:01.620
 That was the layout here by great post-chancy. Explored that meaning, so clearly brilliant, so that

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.000
 we can connect it.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 We can recognize as jewel, the breakage of the jewel as jewel, jewel, so special, special.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.630
 And that is echoed by the lineage master's and his only Dhanjil Rambaju, sheared and wrote down

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.000
 here, so that we can connect it.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 And explore that. And for that reason, how wonderful, how beautiful, how special.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.290
 And for that reason, always in the teachings said, I should remind that to all of us, to you and to

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.000
 myself,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 bring more joy, more appreciation, more thankful, more gratitude to many different levels.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 And our lives, situation, circumstances, we are surrounded, even though we are in samsara.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 We have lot of good reason to be celebrated, acknowledge things. We shouldn't forget.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Saying things and being great, it is a core Buddhism, the foundation, very foundation of Dharma.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Practice Dharma, since we practice Dharma. That is essence, foundation of Dharma.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.460
 When we practice Dharma, we should practice Dharma with joy, with appreciation, with thankful, with

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.000
 open mind, open heart.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 That is known as practitioners. Then, together with that, we combine with bodhicitta.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 What is essence of bodhicitta is completion. You all know. We all heard that teaching.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 But knowing is not just enough. We have to act like, activate that.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 How we activate it? A core lineage instruction. Follow that.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And follow all that you all received. You all know. We all know, I am sambhrivi.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And which is recorded teaching, the sixth paramatas.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 The greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, combines that and highlights that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 And it is so beautiful. And it is really too easy so that we can approach it, connect it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.890
 And the sixth paramata practices, joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, is we are not going to have to

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.000
 collect that somewhere else.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.290
 We don't have to be kind of like, something expert and fancy and rich and kind of like, very

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.000
 skilled.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 It is all a treasure of our heart, our nature of the mind, our self.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.360
 We explore that our richness, it makes rich of our self, our heart more rich, more goodness, and as

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.000
 well as other beings in everyone.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So therefore, this is what really bodhicitta is so important.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.290
 So that means, again, if I some kind of more condensed way, bring you more joy, more appreciation,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.000
 more grateful with that thought with bodhicitta.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.300
 Have bodhicitta. And that bodhicitta thought is not limited bodhicitta thought for all the living

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.000
 beings.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Every living being combined with what's called poor, immeasurable quality of the bodhicitta.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Poor, immeasurable, you all know, in a debate, same ever again, that same ever again.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.360
 Poor, boundless, poor, immeasurable, boundless love, boundless compassion, boundless joy or the

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.000
 reduced, boundless equanimities.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 When we have that thought, what it does? It makes our self more happier, more peaceful.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 It will purify our obscurations, negativities, diseases, sickness.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It is mostly one of the powerful tools to healing our self.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Really, truly, it's not just a mythological story telling. It is evidence.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 We each of us, we can witness it when we have really true love and compassion, joy and openness,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 valence, thought.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 It immediately turns the environment, our environment, our perception, something, different stages.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 These are not stories that we can all know.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.100
 And that is practice. The foundation, heart of the dharma, heart of the practice, whatever dharma

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.000
 you practice, such as that.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And this is also really the essence of any religions.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:51.650
 Loving-kind is compassion. It's the deep foundation, core of the religions, or the virtues, or the

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.000
 spirituals.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 That is what is.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 So with this understanding, today, now we practice of the Gurbam Masam of Sisi.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Gurbam Masam of Sisi is totally enlightening.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And as here, as I said already, and you all know, you already have the booklet.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 You all have that, I think, copy. You can read.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Now, if we go this way, it's now where we are today.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:26.470
 Today, the first, as I said, it's explaining of the Gurbam which is qualities, or the realization,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.000
 achievement of that.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 So that means the object and subject, we say. Object and subject.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.720
 So now object is the object of rafooch, object of our soul, protective, guidance is Gurbam Masam

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.000
 Baba,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 who is the embodiment of all that explained. And as you read in the text, you see that.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 As Thas and Danta, what's the realm of body right in front of our sky, in front of you, each of us.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 We should see that. See that.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 And that is then what is said.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.450
 And if I look to this one, I have this image today, so therefore I think I can maybe connect that

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.000
 more betterly.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And so, now the first two lines and here.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Yesterday we went, I think, three and a half lines. Three and a half lines.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:44.400
 That represented, as he said, representative of the Gurbam Masam Baba Buddha, Gurbam Masam Baba

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.000
 Dharma,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Sangha, Guru, Deva, Dakini, Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya, all that is what is explored.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 So that means Gurbam Masam Baba, simply Gurbam Masam Baba, embodiment of all the object roughness.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 That's what it is. All object roughness. Object roughness.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 The next one is what? How he becomes object roughness.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Or how he becomes embodiment of all that enlightenment.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 That explaining here, here in this second part of the third lines, in what is indicated.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Rathpur, Subjugato of the Mahas.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 So that is what.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 And Gurbam Masam Baba, actually of course, is what?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Of course, I'm sure you all know that.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Gurbam Masam Baba is according to teaching, reincarnation of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Why I'm saying that?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Because, when Buddha Shakyamuni announced his Mahaparinarana,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 which means passing away in the normal language, but his Mahaparinarana,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 beyond the samsara nirvana, when he began to departing that.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 He announced that.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And many Sangha members, or disciples,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 and particularly Ananda, feel very upset.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 At that time, Gurbam Masam Baba told to Ananda,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 "Ananda, you should not be upset."

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 I will be back after eight years from my Mahaparinarana,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 and back even better than myself.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Reality, there is no higher realization better than the Buddha Shakyamuni himself,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 but Buddha Shakyamuni liked to glorify his reincarnations of the future.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Who will be that? Gurbam Masam Baba.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Why, he said, why he is better?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Because he will be born from lotus.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 He will be free from death and birth.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Death and birth.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 And therefore all those reasons Buddha used.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Reality, according to the teaching, the death and the birth is just the only dream.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 There is nothing changed in the reality level, in the Dharma-Kaya level.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Death and birth, and not just the death and birth,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 all the display of the samsara or the relative truth is merely magic show,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 displays of the nature.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Reality is the same, no difference.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 But however, Buddha glorified his reincarnation.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Therefore, Gurbam Masam Baba is known as Buddha's reincarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Also, Gurbam Masam Baba, according to the teaching,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 he is teaching of the Vedayana teachings.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni gives Vedayana teachings in higher realms.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 But in the human level, that time,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 he gives more in the basic teachings as well as Mahayana teachings, Sutra Mahayana teachings.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 But the Vedayana teachings, he gives only higher realms.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 As the Buddha Shakyamuni gives the Vedayana teachings in higher realms,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 who export that teaching to available?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 This is one of those great masters, Gurbam Masam Baba, who bought.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Therefore, in the teaching often mentioned,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Gurbam Masam Baba is master or teacher of the Tantras and Vedayana teachings.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 On the other hand, of course, you all know, just to say it briefly,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Gurbam Masam Baba is also known as emanation of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 living Buddha Amitabha right now,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 in the pure land of the Sukhavati or Devakim, and living.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 And his emanations, Gurbam Masam Baba is emanation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 How the teaching says that?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 And Buddha Shakyamuni says, "Amitabha is dharmakaya Buddha.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 "Avalokudishora or Chinyasai is narmakaya Buddha."

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Sorry, Sambokaya Buddha.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 And Gurbam Masam Baba is narmakaya Buddha.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 of the Amitabha.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So, it is the same Buddha that emanated.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 From the heart center of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 and he said, "Aminated the golden light with five points of the golden regular."

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 Five points of the golden regular.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 "To the right, the middle of the like dharmakaya

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 "on the middle, the center of the lotus."

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Pristral lotus.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 And there, Gurbam Masam Baba immediately appeared.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 As, at year, youth.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 At year old, youth.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 A bird, youthful, say this.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 And that is.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And Gurbam Masam Baba has no history.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 That passed away.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 When he came to Tibet,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 after staying about 55 years according to teaching,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 teaching all the different days according,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 but about 55 years history.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 And he left Tibet.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 He flew away in the sky, as a Garuda, or as a bird,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 with all the instructions, teachings, finite instructions, teachings.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Trita, Tibetan king, and ministers, and men and women,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 and all that disciples, he gave, and he flew away.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And in a sense, also he said, "I am never going away.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 "I will be always with you.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 "And I will assure you, every such vacuum and circumstance,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 "ever you call me, really."

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And therefore, Gurbam Masam Baba, ever since,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 is very active, living Buddhas.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 So how he achieved in a relative level, and here.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Then he said, "Here."

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 What did he say, "Here?"

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 This is, I'm explaining, this rat for subjugate the Mara.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 You look to that, and then I just go into Tibet.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 That is a little more easy for me to go into.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And he said, because what he did,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 he said he completely destroyed, or destroyed subjugated poor demons

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 in his own status.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 Maybe we discussed that yesterday a little bit too.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 His own natural status.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 So that means what?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 It's not, is killing someone or subjugating someone

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 as a subject object.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Subjugated, it is own status, own natural status.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 What are those four demons?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 As I said yesterday, and many of you know that,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 but again I repeat it.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 The demon of the emotions, negative emotions.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 How do you subjugate negative emotions?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 When you subjugate those negative emotions,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 or liberate those negative emotions within the spirit of the nature,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 of the great emptiness, that is subjugating.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 When you subjugate those negative emotions,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 what is the name?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Known as five wisdom, which I'm also explaining later,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 so I won't go here.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Five wisdom.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 When you achieve the five wisdom,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 when you transform all the negative emotions in the wisdom,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 that is subjugation.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 There is nothing left behind, behind something,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 or this is the reminding of that subjugation, something we can see.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 That is called subjugating its own natural status.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And the next demon is what?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Demon of the aggregates.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 What is aggregates, actually?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Those five aggregates, you all know.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Again, this is already mentioned in later, so I will go over that.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 But how Gurbi and Masambhava are transformed?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Alrigates are all transformed into the wisdom.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Physical forms are transformed into rainbow body.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 That is subjugating.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 That is subtle.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Our gross body of the element, fire, water, wind, earth,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 is transformed into wisdom.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 That's called rainbow body.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 It's subtle.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 All that, the grossest element, the particles, everything transcendent.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 And the refined wisdom status, as like the light.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Right?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 That is the sudhu getting, the aggregate, demon of aggregates.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 And the demon, sudhu with the demon of the distractions.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 I translate it.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 I'm sure you see here how they translate it.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 But I'm translated as a distraction.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 How that translates?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 When you have the perfect samadhi realizations and the wisdom,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 when you have the power of mindfulness, alertness, consciousness,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 that transforms into the wisdom status.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 There are no distractions.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 No distractions.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 All that distraction is disappeared.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Everything is meaningful activities.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 That is subduing the demon of the distractions.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And then, what is demon of the death?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 That obviously is the Ngharabhema Samba we all know,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 beyond the death and birth.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 The notion of the death is disappeared from Ngharabhema Samba.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 That means what?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Dissolving, declaring our physical forms.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Merging our physical forms, if you read the Bible books,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 one after another is merging.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 That means losing the strength and energy and vitality of the physical forms.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 That never happens in Ngharabhema.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 It's all transformed into Muslim.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 To defeat it and substitute the demon of the death.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 That's the how Ngharabhema Samba achieved and started as a transcendental,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 rainbow body of the enlightenment Buddha.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Totally enlightenment in the Buddha of now.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Right? Leaving Buddha now.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 And then here, say, in the Tibetan language,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 maybe in the English, not exactly maybe,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 but subduing the three enemies.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 And now there are three enemies.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 What are these enemies?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 It's not an enemy as duality consumption.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Labored enemies.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 This enemy is bigger, more deeper, more massive.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 This enemy is duality.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 Ngharabhema Samba don't have the duality mind.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Duality mind means clinging, grasping,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 clinging to the subject, clinging to the object,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 and clinging, clinging.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Ammonite it. That.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 So that here is what in the Tibetan world I am going to use.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 And now there are the three enemies.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 The externally duality, inwardly emotions,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 and secretly all the conceptions.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Consruptions.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Those are the enemies.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Why is it used metaphorically enemies?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Because they are the fundamentally really obstacles,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 our well-being, happiness, and peace.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Constant health. There are what's called not helping.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Constantly disturbing.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 And what the great Master Chantideva said,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Chantideva said, this grasping or this ego clinging

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 is continually disturbing from the beginning times.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 This is the biggest devil.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Why this ego clinging I should keep?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 This clinging, there is no actual reality existing ego

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 or cling that we can hold.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 It's only mental status.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 How we form the ego according to the teaching.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 We form the ego by the formation, poem, and name.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Three things.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Poems, our physical poems, our formation what we think,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 kind of formation of the appearance, and our name.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Whatever the name we have.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Combined mixed together they think I.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Reality is all this illusion.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 So we are grasping, holding the illusion of the bubble

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 that is not really solid existing as ego

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 or as so important.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Important.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 So that is what the Gurbam Masambha subdue.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Analytically.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Native.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 That is the Gurbam Masambha.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 And therefore, Gurbam Masambha what is?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Again I say sambha which you tell.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Gurbam Masambha embodiment of old but as loving kindness.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 Embodiment of old but as compassion.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Embodiment of old but as versatile.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 versatile come together or Buddha's bodhisattva.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 All that come together in one single state as Gurbam Masambha.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So that is our object of rafuj.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 That explaining all the quality, achievement, realization

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 of the Gurbam Masambha.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Next one is then we go here.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Yeah.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Now is from here.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And we look to here in this again English group.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 And that is it.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 To you I pray.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 From that on is now ourself.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 So we feel the strong presence of Gurbam Masambha

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 as old that call it as we went through.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 And more than that I'm calling it achievement, realization

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 of Gurbam Masambha or Buddha's are really beyond the speech.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 But there is no word to explain it.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Actually what we are talking is just like what's called the tip

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 of the iceberg or just tip of what we're talking.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 It's immense.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 I mean this is immeasurable in the teachings here.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 The call of Buddha is even the great bodhisattva.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Manjushri is trying, the most intelligent, highly versatile,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 enlightenment, is trying to explain the call of Buddha

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 for eons still not completed, not finished.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 That is really the call of the Buddha's.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 But here is this condensed so that we can connect something

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 to our duality mind so we can really explore our call it

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 and have the realization as Gurbam Masambha.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 So that is what is.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 Now to that from here onward is then our practitioners,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 what we want.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 So here sitting here again so I will go with my spirit and say this.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 So here.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 And here again I pray here.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 To you I pray.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 There is according our capabilities there is three different ways to pray.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Praise.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 I mean it's as His Holiness or the past great chance to explain it here.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 So I mean you can look there too.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 The first prayer is, is what Nini said here.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Nini said outwardly to pray with permanent devotion,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 a strong yearning with that quickly accomplishing our desire

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 to attend only in the supreme cities is this practices.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 This is the practices.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Practice of the nimbas.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 So this is how we practice this.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 How we pray.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Here I say the permanent devotions.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 What that means is permanent devotions.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 Generally it means confidence.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 Permanent devotion means confidence with the knowing the richness qualities,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 richness benefits.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 You have the confidence.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Generally in the Buddha teaching that faith is so important.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 And of course any religions I think faith is so important.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 F-A-I-T-H faith is so important.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 What in the teaching great master Nagarjuna said,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 what is most important for to practice?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 When we starting or starting contemplating meditation,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 first the most important is faith.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 Then what is important next is wisdom.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Among the faith and the wisdom which is more important, Nagarjuna said.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Again his own.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 He said wisdom is important.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Wisdom is more important.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Even though wisdom is so important but in order to bring the wisdom you need faith.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 So what means faith actually then?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 Inspire.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 Inspirations.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 You have to inspire.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 That is according to Buddha's teaching there is three different faiths.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 First, second and third.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 First is inspired.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 That is the beginning of faith.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 How that happened?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 Great master Jimi Langpa said in his teaching.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Said, said there is two causes.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 One of the cause is to inspire.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 You have good friend of the spiritual friend.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Good accompanying with the spiritual friends.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 And contract with the qualified teachers.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 And the bored and the tired with the samsara activities.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Samsara activities.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 And then feel because of those and reading the books of the Buddha or the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 And then you aspire.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 That is the beginning of the inspiration or beginning of the faith.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Second is faith in the Buddha's teaching.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Teaching is desiring.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Now we actually engage more.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Not just inspired kind of looking distantly but now you like to evolve more.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 Engaging and participating.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 Practicing, starting, learning, some good things.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 That is the second.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 It's more deeper than inspiration.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 But inspiration is there.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 It's not gone.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Because of inspiration and now you become more deepening.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Or not just you, we are more deepening ourselves.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 Then you more understand, more knowledge, more confidence.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 Then you build the confidence.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 Now you have the confidence.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 Strong confidence.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 That is Danyakkol.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Confidence, the great master, the Jigulam master.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Unshakeable confidence.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Confidence.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Unshakeable confidence to the Dharma, to the Sangha and to the Buddha.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 All the teachings, practicing.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Now truly it is.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 So that means no matter what ever happened,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 saturation, circumstance, good change and all that is not going to expire.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Many times our devotion, interest and joys are expired.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 Kind of decline.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 It just looks like a stamp, what's it called?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Stamped dates on the bottle or the containers and then it's expired.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 Why not? Why that?

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Because the inspiration is a decline and the involvement is a decline.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 And then your effort is a decline.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 All that can decline and then it's expired.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 When you have the unshakeable devotion, confidence and understanding,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 it's never going to dissipate.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 More business.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Situations, circumstances, whatever is happening,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 extended, whatever, kundraic era,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 even is become more stronger, more bigger, stronger.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Strength, ability.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 As in the uses, in the teachings, sometimes the pile of the end of ear,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 or volcano piles, they're never going to demolish it.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 Stone and the stone.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 And then you completely transform it.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 So this is what here, the immense devotion.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 It's confidence.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 The third devotion.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 And that third devotion in the Buddha teaching,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 or the practice lineage, in the instructions in the teaching,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 sometimes says you have the pile, what's called the pile of confidence,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 pile of different confidence or pile of different knowledge.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 And now see that.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 What are those five?

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 If I listed that, listed, first confidence is,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 such as the Gurbama sambhava.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 See, have the confidence.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Gurbama sambhava is embodiment of all the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 And as explained here, Guru Deva Dakini and Altarik Ayas, surely.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 And so that is second, first.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 Second confidence, all the activities of the Gurbama sambhava

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 is activity of the Buddha's activities.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 What that means, Buddha's activities,

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 is absolutely best upon the wisdom and the comparison.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Even though they appeared in the rough, in all these things, different things.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 But it is all in the comparison.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 Love and helping as needed, helping, supporting, all that.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 And third.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 And third confidence.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 See, Gurbama sambhava is even,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 even though it is as equal as the Buddha,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 all the Buddhas are more enlightened beings,

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 but Gurbama sambhava is even more kind,

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 kinder to myself than the old Buddhas.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Buddha, more kind.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Because Gurbama sambhava is a living master,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 or embodiment of all the teachers.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 And Gurbama sambhava bought all the lineage teachings.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 Teachings, teachings.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 And then fourth one is, Gurbama sambhava is,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 is that, I think maybe I mixed it a little bit.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 Gurbama sambhava is embodiment of all the Buddhas,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 every enlightened beings.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 There is no other better enlightened beings than Gurbama sambhava.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 And that is fourth.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Fifth confidence.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 If I follow the instructions and the teachings

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 of the Gurbama sambhava,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 I will surely achieve enlightenment,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 discover my innate inborn wisdom.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 Have that confidence in heart and mind.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Mind and practicing, and I pray to you.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 I pray.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 That is immense here.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 In here, I pray through the,

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 to prevent devotion and strong yearning that,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 and quickly desire.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 So that is really there.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 When you have that thought,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 then, then continually practices,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 continually practices and all the achievements

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 will come naturally.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 When you have that, prevent the devotion

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 and the connection to Gurbama sambhava with that.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 And that is known as here.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 I mean, it's not just here.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 It is known as nimba in the Tibet.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Because here, if you look in English with this,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 you see the small letter was slightly different.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Nimba, drupa, and lefjor in this section of that.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 There is three lines, three words.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 That's slightly different than the other words.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Nimba, which translated here, approaches,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 drupa, accomplishments, and lefjor activities.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 So that is then you will achieve those.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 That is nimba. Nimba means what?

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 As translated already,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 approaching or closely connecting, contact.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 So that means, Gurbama sambhava right in front of the sky,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 and with that immense devotion,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 and that longing devotions,

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 and if you practice meditating, reciting, mantras,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 that is known as closely connecting

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 to Gurbama sambhava, closely connecting.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 With that closely connecting,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 and then what is said here.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 That, that.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 And so that is outer here,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 according to the great first agency or his own journey.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 That nimba is closely connecting this.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 And inwardly, with this, because of that,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 now you explain it, or we explain it,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 our realizations, not just localized that, localized,

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 and see all the three doors.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 I mean, you looked at that, your English, of course.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 In all the three doors here, what are the three doors?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 Body, speech, our body, our speech, our mind,

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 all poem, song, space, all are here.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 The medalla of the Gurbama sambhava.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 So now the Gurbama sambhava is not just localized

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 right in front of our space, is that,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 of course that is, but the whole universe,

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 the whole existence, everything,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 is within the medalla of Gurbama sambhava.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 This is not just came somewhere else,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 and happened that.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 No, reality is all in that status.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 That state means what?

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 And the state of the poem is enlightened.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 Song is enlightened.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 Space, mind are enlightened.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Ordinarily, when we're discovering that,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 why that happens?

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Because according to the Buddha teaching,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 we purify the curtain of the duality

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 that blocks to see that.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Then you see the reality phase,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 or that moment we are home, or back to home, to sweet homes.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 Until that will be a jifsu of the delusions.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 Really, outer layer.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 The moment you discover that is just a dream.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 It's not just arrived.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 That in the teaching, we heard so many times,

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 poem is five dhyana buddhas.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 Our aggregate is of five male buddhas.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Five element is of five female buddhas.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 We heard those when we visualize buddhas and dharas.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 And all mantras, sound are the mantras.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 This is what's called mandala of three caiyas,

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 or three doors.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Go, song, talk, body, speech, mind.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Sometimes the terminology uses three various states,

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 various form, various sound, various mind and speech.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 This is not just newly arrived.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 Newly arrived is constructed.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000
 It's propagated by the consumption.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 It's organized.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 Therefore, when you achieve enlightenment,

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 reach the realization, then that's it.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 It's never going to be.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 Again, lost that realization.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Change is forever.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 We are residing in that state all the time,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 but we did not recognize.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
 By the teaching of the greatest teacher,

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurav Emma Sambaba,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 now we can connect.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 We can reveal our treasures,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 our knowledge, our realization.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 That is what is known as the mandala of this.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 When you see that clearly here,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 that is what here is named as accomplishment.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
 This is not just a small accomplishment.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 That's the great accomplishment.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 So first is the approach,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 and the second is accomplishment.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
 Accomplishment, our own.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
 We returned back to our dominions.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 Our dominions returned back.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
 That is accomplishment.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
 The next one is according here, here and what?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 It is according to the secondary level.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:09.000
 Secondary level, that is then activities.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 Secondary level is then again.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
 All these things, what we're talking,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
 immense devotion, first approach,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
 and the second is accomplishment, all that.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 But reality level, where is all that?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
 Where is it coming?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 Where is that all happening?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
 In here, His Holiness Duryumutya,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
 or the first great intensity,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 only so clearly is our own nature of the mind,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
 our own mind.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 The trail is right here with us.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 We are just only here.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
 In the Buddha teaching, as I said yesterday,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
 and you know, I mean, it's not something I'm saying,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
 that I'm saying that you don't know, really.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 In a way, we remind each other that, you know.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
 Buddha said, in the Buddha,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 the sutramahayana teachings,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 everyone inherited enlightened beings.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 Enlightenment, all that.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 And those are clearly exploited

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 by the great Master Nagarjuna and Bhatira or Ashenghas.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 And all the great Masters mentioned,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 the Buddha, all the mandalas,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
 everything is residing within our heart and mind,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
 in our nature of the mind.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 Our nature of the mind is, as here,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
 say the secondary level,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 is embodiment of pork eyes, pork eyes,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 and the five wisdom.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
 It's already there.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 This pork eye and the five wisdom,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 that is absolute Buddhists,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
 absolute gurus,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 or absolute Gaurabhamma Sambo.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 And for that reason, in the Thermatikins,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 something you said today,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
 Thermatikins said,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 looking to your own energy and nature of the mind,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
 which is free from the past,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 the future, or three times,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
 free from the three times,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
 presently awareness, fresh, naked nature,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 is the absolute Lama,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 absolute Gaurabhamma Sambo.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 Behold in that is,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 you are beholding the true face of Lama,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
 that which is his only Nuru Mooji's teaching,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 in short Hindu practices.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 He said, what?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
 Dissolving Lama,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 and behold,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 dissolving to Lama one's own heart,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
 and beholding to the one's own awareness

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
 is true face of Lama.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 That means true Lama.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
 That is true Lama,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 the absolute Lama,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 the original Lama,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 and the Lama of forever.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
 Yes.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
 Many times in teaching those great practitioners,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 I called my root teacher,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 calling Lama power,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
 but when I discovered of the Lama or teacher,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 Lama is not out.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 Lama is within.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
 With that immense discover of the joy,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 I relaxed.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 Those are in the teaching set.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 When you discover that teaching,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 what it comes?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 Love, compassion, joy,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
 wisdom, understanding,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
 respect and appreciation,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 all the bodhicchathas,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 all that comes,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
 just flowing there.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 And you become so humble,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
 simple,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 droned to the earth,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 with full common sense.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 Truly that is then,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 we become the one with the beautiful human beings,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 or beautiful sentient beings,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
 on this planet.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 That is.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
 That is discovery.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 So to discover that here,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
 as Nirmaj said, post-great kensi,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 and see that with great confidence,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 relax in that natural status.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 Don't make any publication activity,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
 this and that, engage.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 Be relaxed, become peaceful,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 and be in that,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
 be in that status.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
 That is your beholding Lama.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 You are merging with the absolute Lama.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 Lama with our own natural status.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 That is here.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
 That is actualizing.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
 So approaching, accomplishing,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 and then actualizing.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
 So approaching, accomplishing,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 and actualizing.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 What's called here?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 Activity.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 That is activity.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
 And that is also,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 I'm translating as then you actualize.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 You actualize, you engage.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 And the next one is now,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 we go to the next one.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
 Next one is,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 and then again you look to this.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 So we pray.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 So this time,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
 pray is not just a praying as a subject or object,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
 but praying is relaxing in the natural state,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 keeping that, or abiding in that state,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
 continued is the praying.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 This prayer is not effort, effortless,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
 calm and relaxed.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
 That is also ultimate teaching of the Dzogchen,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 or Dzogchen, or the Mahamudala,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 all those teachings.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
 When that comes here,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
 it is what in the teachings said many times,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 in the suttas, or in many teachings too,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 in Dzogchen teachings.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 There is nothing to remove,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 nothing to add,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 relaxing in the natural state as it is.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 When you behold that natural state as it is,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 that moment will liberate it.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
 That is simple,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
 but yet with mindfulness,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 joyful effort,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 and all those continuation without destructing.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 What is Dzogchen?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
 Dzogchen is emotions.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 Restruct means we are carried by maybe attachment,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
 or anger, or jealous, heavy thoughts,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 or combination,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
 and then also a transform that all emotions

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 in the anxieties, and worry,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 and all those things.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 That is Dzogchen.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 That is samsara mind.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 Dzogchen is samsara.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 That is known as root of samsara.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 Root of samsara.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 That is in samsara.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 The root of samsara.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
 That root is just a vein.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
 It is spread out.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 It is endless.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 It is like ripples of samsara.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 That becomes bigger, bigger, bigger,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 and then it creates waves and tides,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
 and clashing back and forth.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 Reality level is all mental state.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 The next one.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 Now the next one is great blessings.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
 Great blessings.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 Again, blessing is what?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
 And here it says,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
 so it is reaffirming that actualizing.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
 When the blessing comes,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 the body blessing of the guru comes,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
 then our body, all the forms become the major body

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 of the translucent state.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 When the speech blessing comes of the guru,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 the guru and the sambhava,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
 all our mind and voice,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 sorry, all our soul systems and our voice,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
 and all the soul systems become as a regular song.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
 And then when mind blessing comes of the guru

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 and the sambhava realization becomes,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
 and then our, all the space and our mind

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
 all become as first awareness,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 regular status or mind,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 regular mind that actualizes.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
 So that means that what?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 Reaffirming, reactualizing,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
 restating of what I already mentioned,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 that actualizing.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
 Actualizing Pope Gaius and the five of us,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
 that is, is then the blessings.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 We got that.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 That is really the blessings.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
 That means we discovered our treasures,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 our natural qualities as we have.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 That is the blessings.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
 Very blessings.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
 That blessings.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
 And then of course, the five of us,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
 the four Gaius and the five of us,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
 what are those?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 Of course, I'm sure you all know,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 but I would just say the names.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 We are already talking about the dharmakaya,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 sambhokaya, and dharmakaya.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
 Those are the three Gaius.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 Poltakaya is suvabakaya.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 So in Sanskrit world,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 which of course all is, I think, Sanskrit world,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
 suvabakaya.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
 So I translated all those into English,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 roughly dharmakaya means the body.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Dharma is nature.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 If I translate it now,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 now this is dharma as nature.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 So poem of the nature,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 poem of that is dharmakaya,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 and the sambhokaya is poem, F-O-R-M.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 Poem of the luxuries, luxuries.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
 And then narmakaya, poem as emanation,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 and suvabakaya as poem of as it is.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
 And the suvabakayas and dharmakayas

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
 are slightly different.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 What is the difference in the teaching?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 The teaching said what is dharmakaya

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 has explaining more clarity of the nature

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 and the suvabak explaining more emptiness

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 or the space aspect of the nature.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 That is a slightly different reality than dharmakaya

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
 and the suvabakaya is similar.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
 And of course, after all, these three kayas are no difference from each other.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
 Narmakaya contains all that four kayas,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 sambhokaya contains all four kayas,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 and dharmakaya has all that four kayas.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 So it's not something different from the west and the southeast.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 It's really all in itself.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 It's just the only aspect of that.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
 That is just love.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 Of course, you all know those things, so you can do more.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
 And the five of us are...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
 Five of us are, of course, I think you know, but I will list the names.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
 Dharmadattu of us, Beralek of us,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 Econymiti of usudoms, and just Kramen nation awareness of usudoms,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 or distinctly clearly understanding of usudoms

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
 and all accomplishing usudoms.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
 Those are the five usudoms, five usudoms.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 And so that, when you achieve that goal,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 and that is known as Buddhism or Mahayana Buddhism,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
 all Mahayana Buddhism is enlightened, you become the Buddha.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 And the symbol to summarize all that usudoms,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 as I mentioned earlier, and you all know,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
 love and kindness, compassion, wisdom.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 Those are all really usudoms.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
 Or every other way to tell that usudoms,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 all the five usudoms, to summarize,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 those are known as usudoms that know every...

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 all the relevant truths as it is, the wisdom that knows exactly...

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
 absolute truth as it is, that is two usudoms.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
 Then in teaching, say, all that combine with one wisdom,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 the wisdom that knows all.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 That is... all... that means all...

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
 relevant truths, absolute truths, whatever it is, all knows.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 That is, in the debate, it's a number, time change, and we should go.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
 So that is all of us, that is the Buddha.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 And now, here we go.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 Go to the next one, and which is, now, by the brain.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:25.000
 The brain here, this field here, then...

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 And then here, that's...

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 Now, among these five, six fragile lines,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 we are in the pit lines, pit lines,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
 which is dispelled out in sicker obstacles.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 So that means, by your blessings.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 I pray to you, symbol to tell, I mean, you know that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 Symbol to tell, I pray to you, M.Sambhava.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
 And by your blessings, dispelled all the obstacles.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 That's it.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 In and out of the obstacle.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
 And that is, now, you look here.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 Dispelled... dispelled all obstacles.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 And that is, according to this,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 and the obstacles of the...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
 all our... generally, every talk is kind of simple,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
 which will tell obstacles of the joy, in peace,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
 happiness, well-being, and fulfillment in our lives.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 Those are very kind of, in a way, basic things.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
 So dispelled all that obstacle.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
 So that means, what?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 May I have the well-being?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 May I have the fulfillment?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 May I have the no kind of handedness, difficulty, challenge, trouble?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
 And those are dispelled.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 The normal, average wishes of the samsara beings.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 Then, specifically, kind of wishes, what we have.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
 Obstacles are obstacles for our meditations.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 Or that means to achieve enlightenment,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 or to become the Buddha, in order to benefit all living beings.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 So that means, the obstacles for our bodhichatas.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 Obstacles for bodhichatas.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
 Bodhichata is our goal to benefit for all sentient beings.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
 Bodhichata is our goal to reveal that traitors.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 Bodhichata is our traitors.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:26.000
 It's hiding behind all these kind of delusions and obscurations.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 So now, we like to remove.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
 We like to dispel that.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 Order to dispel that is not always easy.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 There is so many difficulties, so many challenges, so many troubles.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 It really comes one after another.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
 Even you have higher realizations.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 Higher realizations.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 And that also still can happen.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
 And for those reasons, here, sitting here.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
 And here, what is generally said,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
 this is all the obstacles.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 And the outer obstacles.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
 These outer obstacles are clearly isolated here.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
 I'm not going to talk too much.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
 I mean, you all know this.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 There are 60 different obstacles.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
 Those are related with all our negative emotions.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
 Five poses.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 And fundamentally, again, it's said, five poses.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
 But five poses, again, to point down five poses,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
 where it arises, is ego claims.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 By our ego, self-importance is,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 of course, due to that, all these emotions arise.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 And why we have this ego claim is due to the ignorance.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 Ignorance is drawn behind the scene,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 but it is really fundamental obstacles.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
 And that, when it's reflected there,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 and then according to teaching here, it says,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 clearly, all those are the negative emotions

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 that are reflected in these different obstacles.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 One after another.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 There is 16 listed, and you see that.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
 So that is.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
 And actually, one, those are outer obstacles.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
 And that included, then, of course, sicknesses.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 And losing our loved ones.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
 I mean, all those obstacles, really.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
 So that means all that purify it, outer obstacles.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.000
 And the inner of tiggers here says that four demons,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
 as we earlier mentioned.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:41.000
 The first one is that here listed the demon of the aggregates,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
 and the demon of the emotions,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
 and the demon of the, how did I get here?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 You know?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 So the demon of the negative,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 second, the demon of the negative emotions.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
 And the third is the demon of the,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
 I translated, destructions.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
 But here, also, I mean, that's how it says,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 translated, not translated.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
 This teaching is standard terminology.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
 It says the demon of the deceiving of the,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 by the, here is pleasure, pleasure.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 Or the demon, demon of the deceiving of the,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
 of the appealing.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 Something is appealing, if I translate it.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 So that is the demon of the appealing.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
 Something that is appeals to me, appeals.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
 I like that, I just, I like that.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 I would like to be this, kind of this, that.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
 But that is one of the, according to the teaching,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
 say, one of the biggest demons.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 Why?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
 It is so, so passive, passive.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 So naive, so passive.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 See, it's very sneaky, it's sneaky.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
 You don't really see that is obstacle

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 until it made something big trouble.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 It's just, they say, very crawling, crawling, kind of armed.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
 A-N-T armed, crawling armed.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
 Behind the scene, it become bigger and bigger,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
 and then it will now drown us.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 That can happen even great practitioners,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
 or really beings in the Buddha teaching.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
 That's why it's called, called here, translated,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
 very deceiving.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 But because it's appealing. Why is it appealing?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
 Or is it like this aggregate of the,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 a demon of, aggregate, a demon of the emotional,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
 very noticeable.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
 Every, every kind will have good practice,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 and every of the mindful, immediately we can catch this.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 But this is something so passive,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 underground in a way.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 It's just this mind.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
 And this is all related with,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
 sensually pleasure objects of the senses.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 and of feelings, what is.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 That is big disturbance, disturbance.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
 So that is demons.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 And then demon of the human.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
 The death. That is then, of course, obvious demon of death.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
 It is disturbing, interrupting our continuation

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 of the practice, meditation.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 And then it's also fundamentally,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
 this demon of the death is best upon the ego clings.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 Because we cling ourself. Ourself.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
 And then what great master known as Gautam Chakra,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
 he said, there's nothing more precious in the samsara

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
 than our own lives.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
 L-I-F-E.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 Therefore, to protect the life is so important.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 And for that reason, I may give very famous teachings

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
 of the practice of the white tharas.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 White tharas is considered one of the very longevity Buddhists.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 So you see that.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 So that's the really how it is.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
 That is poor demons.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
 And now I said already before, a few times,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 so I won't go over those four demons.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
 And then there is also the inner obstacles.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
 The secret obstacles are then, again, same thing.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
 Negative emotions.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 And those are then here.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
 Attachment, anger, anger, ignorance.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
 And arrogance and jealousness.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
 All those obstacles.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Those are obstacles.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
 When you transform those obstacles, what is it?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 The attachment transformed.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
 Discrimination, awareness of wisdom.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 And anger, when transformed or liberated,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 marrow-like wisdom.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
 Ignorant, transformed as dharmadatta wisdom.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
 Arrogant, transformed as--

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 Oh, maybe I mixed up a little bit.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 Oh, no, not mixed up.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 And the arrogant, transformed as equanimated wisdom.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
 And jealous, transformed as all accomplished wisdom.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 So when you were able to do that,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
 or even we didn't be able to do that,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
 immediately we kept by our mindfulness,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000
 alertness, consciousness, not carried by too forcefully, too far.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
 That is known as transforming.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 That is a good sign of the practitioners.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
 You catch that before there are so many things.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 Whenever you can transform that into wisdom,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 what is that?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 Then it's OK teaching, often mentioned.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
 Liberating in its own state.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 Without getting any other remedies,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 moment in any of those emotions arising,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
 looking to the source of that emotions.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 And which is mind.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 Then when you look to the source of that emotions,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 even looks like emotions are stolen there.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 But when you look, there is no relief source.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 We can pinpoint.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
 It's from emptiness.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 Hovering from emptiness and hovering.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 And it's happening in the emptiness.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 It's also going back to the emptiness.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
 Emptiness of mind.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 Comes from the emptiness of mind.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
 And hovering to the emptiness of the state of the mind.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
 And returning back.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 Today, every state of mind, every good practitioner.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 Every day we account, we couldn't handle that well.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
 Then it's hovering in the emptiness state.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
 Even though it's the emptiness, but then it becomes.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
 Then what did that happen?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
 When that happened, what is called?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 Then we created the karma.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
 These negative emotions are generally in the Buddha teaching.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 As we think of them, according to Paul's novel truth,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 this is the cause of suffering truth.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
 This is the cause of suffering truth.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 And so these emotions are creating that now.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 Suffering truth.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
 They are the creator.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
 They are the producer of the karma.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
 And that creates, then, difficulty, challenges.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 So, before that happens, if you are able to handle that,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 that is known as, then, practitioner.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
 How you are really practicing that.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 So that, and now again, with this all,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
 so what is going to disturb?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 Here, his own teaching in the state,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
 it is disturbed for enlightenment, and well-being, and the performance, all that.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 So therefore, the outer obstacles are completely transcendental

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 by the high realizations of the whole.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 Everything is a mandala of the deity, and the mantra,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
 and the display of the Dharma kyasi.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
 That will completely purify it.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
 And inner obstacles are completely purified by the,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
 when you don't hold the grasping, or don't hold the ego clinging,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 that will just completely pacify it.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 And then, the cigarette obstacles, all those negative,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 five negative emotions, when you see they are the five wisdom stages,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
 then that moment, all those situations, circumstances,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 you are transferred to the path, into the path.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 So then, it is really practicing.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
 Then, you are in the path, you are following the path.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 So therefore, those reasons,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
 then I am going to assemble to use the helmet.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 I may have the capability to do this, this.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 So that is the meaning of the pit line.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
 And the sixth line is now...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:39.000
 Sixth line is...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.000
 Sixth line is, and please look to that,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000
 and grant your blessings,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 grant your blessings to all our aspirations are simultaneously fulfilled.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.000
 So that is the final word, or lines,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:14.000
 six major lines as it has, so that is.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 And so that is what, now here.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 Again, if you look to your English, then what is?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
 And so these all sit, which followings are the,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 which followings the wishes of the, for the time being,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 and following the wishes of the ultimate levels.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 The first one is, is the,

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
 until I reach the enlightenment, as any teaching says,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
 so I don't have to really talk more,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 that I will please grant me all this,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
 the opportunity, this situational circumstances,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
 which is known as then, here, known as the seven wealth of the upper rims.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
 What that means? Upper rims.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
 And according to the teaching, there is six rims.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
 That is entirely sentient beings.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
 And those six rims, three lower rims.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
 Hail rims, hungry goat rims, and animal rims.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
 Those are three lower rims.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
 Upper rims, three upper rims.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000
 Human rims, Asura rims, and God's rims.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
 Rims, I think, are E-A-L-M rims.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
 Those are six rims.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:38.000
 So these seven triangles are not wealth or the reach of the three lower rims,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
 but this is the reach of the three upper rims.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.000
 And then, even though we are in the upper rims, many times we don't have that money.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
 That means we human beings don't have all these riches,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
 even though we want.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
 So here, pray to God for some of us.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:09.000
 So grant all this wealth, and those are the, I mean, it's already said here.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:17.000
 So then, you know those, long lives, and no diseases, and beautiful poems,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
 and very fortunate, and good families, and then wealth of prosperity,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
 and knowledge in the systems.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
 Those are the reaches of the seven rims.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
 Seven rims.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
 Oh, sorry.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
 Wealth of the three upper rims.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.000
 And then, and there's seven wealth of the practitioners.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
 I mean, practitioners, above that, that means it didn't mean that practitioners don't need that.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 Above these seven luxuries, riches, and then being as practitioners of the Dharma Buddha teaching,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
 then we think these things, seven things.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
 What are those?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
 Those are, I mean, it's already mentioned.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 Those are known as the noble wealth.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
 Noble wealth.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
 Why is it noble wealth?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 When you have this wealth, you will become, or we will become good practitioners.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
 We will become good bodhisattvas.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
 We will become very beautiful human beings.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Decent, really common, very humble, simple, very sensible, we will become.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 So therefore, this is, and these are the like, call it of the good practitioners.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
 These are, generally, good practitioners.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000
 What is, first is here, said, "Paid," or the devotion, "Paid."

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:59.000
 This, in the teaching, said, "Wealth of the," if I translate, "Wealth," or I also translate in here

01:31:59.000 --> 01:31:59.000
,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000
 in this, "Reach," riches, or the "Wealth of the Paired."

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
 Wealth of the morality, ethics.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Wealth of the here, in the teaching here, said, "Join for effort."

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
 And wealth of the sub-respects, or respect to the others.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 And wealth of the knowledge, or stardings.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
 Wealth of the generositys.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
 Wealth of the openness.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
 Openness, that means wealth, generosity.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
 Wealth of the wisdom.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 And we have that.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
 Many of you can think of those, or you can make details of these, of course, each of them.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
 Wealth of the Paired, we discussed already.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
 Wealth of the morality, or the ethics.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
 According Buddhism, ethics of the Apasakas, male and female, lay practitioners.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 Ethics of the ordinary practitioners.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
 All ethics, the rules, the guidelines of the Vedayana teachings.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000
 All ethics of the both of us. Those are all known as guidelines.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
 These guidelines, these ethics are generally in the Buddha teaching always.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
 It's really a foundation to grow all the good things.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
 So it's not just conduct, or this conduct is not that important.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 Conduct is very foundational.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
 A foundation of all the growth of the spiritual realizations.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:38.000
 And then here, Jyotve effort is the vital, the fuel to practice the Dharma.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
 Fuel, without this fuel we won't go far.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000
 And then the opposite of the Jyotve effort, till Dharma, is the laziness.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
 Sloppiness, not worry about it, motivate it.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 Then just say we are continuously in the samsara, as we are. We are not really going to change it.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
 And then next one is the respect.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
 And I don't know how to translate it, that one I don't know.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 Remember what I'm translating, respect.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 Respect, respect to self-respect, respect to the others.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.000
 And self-respect to self-respect, don't do any mistakes.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
 Try to not do a mistake, straight out of respect.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.000
 Self-respect means respect to one's own self, respect to the family.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
 Family, all the country, all the villages, really be at.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
 Be at recently, nice, caucus, beautiful.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 Be humble, that.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 And respect to the others.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.000
 Even you have good college, respect to others, humble, simple, simple.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
 And with kind and compare you talk.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 That is, if we do that, this is not something that we are out of Dharma.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
 It is Dharma.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
 That's what is the treasure of Dharma.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
 Dharma.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
 And then study, knowledge is so important.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 Studying, all the knowledge is generally important.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
 And teaching is said in Buddhism.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 Because Buddha is known as the omniscient, all-knowing, as we discussed earlier.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
 Why does that all-knowing come by studying?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
 Knowledge.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 In the teaching, sometimes in the teaching, he said,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
 "Even you know you're going to die tomorrow, but still you should learn."

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Why?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:49.000
 He said, "If you learn, you will keep that in the subconsciously stroll house."

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
 Or subconsciously stroll house of the iCloud.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
 You will keep that.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
 In the iCloud of the subconsciousness, you will keep that.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 Because of that, next lifetime you're just going to get back, eat very quickly.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
 Really good, couldn't you?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
 So learn, knowledge is so important.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
 Particularly learn the knowledge that's going to benefit,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
 that means going to make happy ourselves, make happy to others.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
 That stuff, that is so good.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
 So good.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
 This aligns our body to the activities too.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 It's the body.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
 And then, the work of the treasure, sorry, generosity.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
 Generosity of the material generosity.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:46.000
 Generosity of the knowledge and generosity of all the assistants that help us,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
 those all the generalists.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000
 So if you have the capabilities, if you can, it's not too much.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 Help me to the other base, as much as we can, with good heart.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 It is dharma, it is practice.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 And then work of the wisdom, and also all those activities guided by the wisdom,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 all those seven treasures are guided by the wisdom, knowledge.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
 So it's just that.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
 It becomes like, the wisdom is like, ah, it's guiding every aspect of the world.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
 So it becomes completely, very perfectly, beautiful, balanced.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.000
 Nicely beneficial, effective, reasonable, but developing.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
 Those are that.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 So that is what it is.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
 And then finally, there is an ordinary nature.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.000
 It's kind of the goal of which is to get enlightenment.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 And that is already mentioned, and you all know that.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
 So I won't go over too much.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
 But what is practice dharma?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 Practice dharma, accumulate the realization, discover our inner nature of the mind.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 Mind, as we discussed earlier, is joking practices, or Mahamudra practices.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000
 He said, final achievement is the Mahatmudra realization.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 Mahamudra means, means absolute nature of our own mind.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 Discover that nature, which is known as the attack on the garba,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
 there is a terminology, and sometimes named as dharma-dhatu,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
 sometimes named as absolute bodhicata,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
 and sometimes named as ordinal mind.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
 What that means, ordinal mind?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
 Ordinal mind means, ordinal mind is free from the duality.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
 Duality is a publication.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 But the mind that is free from the duality is the ordinal mind.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
 That is the natural, natural of our day, our nature.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
 And the debate is called nyumu sin, the natural mind.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
 Or sometimes even them, ordinal mind.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
 Ordinal mind means what? Not purplicated.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
 Purplicated what?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
 Purplicated of duality, or the emotions of grasping.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
 Then it becomes samsara.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000
 But ordinal mind, ordinal mind, the absolute net bodhicata, is nature of our own.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
 Where this, according to Dukki teaching, all that they are teaching,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
 and the Buddha's teaching and the Sutra teaching is within our heart center.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
 It's right in our society.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
 For those reasons, many times in the teaching said,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 the whole, the sama, the badra, the absolute sama, the badra,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
 self-awareness, sama, the badra, is residing right in the heart center

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
 of the each living being, every living being.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
 No one is absent of that nature.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
 That, that is nature.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
 But by the, the reason of that, by receiving the teaching,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
 practicing with those old wealthy, applying those wealth,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000
 this, the noble wealth, or the, this, the, yeah, noble wealth, applying.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
 And then, glorify the obscurations, obscurations, accommodate the merits,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
 the two merits, and actualize these realizations.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000
 And then, then, reach perfectly in like state, as we are.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
 We regain back our, where we are, where we belong.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
 And that is a planet, wishes.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000
 And by the blessings of the Gaurabheim sama, may I achieve that realization.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
 May I got that realization.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
 May I able to discover this nature.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000
 That is really, then final wishes.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
 Then we perform the complete.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
 Then from that on, then we begin to benefit all the living beings.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
 As Buddhas, Bodhisattva, Gaurabheim sama, and helping to their sentient beings.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
 What's called in the teaching said, the pervasive beneficial activity,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
 continuation beneficial activity, and effortless beneficial activities.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
 Helping for all the sentient beings, emanating so many gaayas and dharma gaayas,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
 narmakaya and Gaurabheim sama emanated, such as at emanation of Gaurabheim sama,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
 or toward the emanation of Gaurabheim sama, benefited for that.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
 When you reach that realization, there is no restrictions.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
 No restrictions of this.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
 The reason, our duality is restricted, we can't do.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
 We just can't move anything too much.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
 It is stopped.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
 When you open the door of the true nature, as it is,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
 there is no restrictions.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
 In the teaching said, if needed, Buddha can be emanated toward them a million times,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
 without moving from the state where the Buddha is.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
 Moving, that can't do.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
 All that realization.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
 That is then the final achievement.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
 Then, of course, there is Gaurabheim sama, and all that.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
 And, of course, that you know, so I won't go over that, and you know that.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
 And this is on the Nirmuja Road.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:27.000
 This is the subcontinent of this teaching, or toward this teaching, at Bhutan, Tiger Nest.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000
 Tiger Nest, he gave this teaching to his consort, or his, I think, his past wife,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
 wife of Nirmuja.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
 And he gave this teaching to him.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
 To him, subcontinent at Tiger Nest came in Bhutan,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
 which is one of the most famous playgrounds sport in the Tibetan Buddhism.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
 It is in the Bhutan.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
 It is very still famous in the Bhutan government.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
 And the world is keeping so beautiful, far from that places.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 And so many great masters and practitioners go with that places.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 It is really very amazing, astonishing, like places.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 So, where he gave this teaching, I think he gave these teachings.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.000
 And around in his age 30s, 30s, he went in the Bhutan around age 30,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
 so that time he gave these teachings.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 And that is my brief talk about this, to some Sanjaya practices today.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
 And now I go to the brief teachings on, again,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
 highlight the practice of the Shinshoja practices.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000
 That you all, I mean, no, actually, of course, but again, it's not just, you know,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
 but I will talk a little bit as a reminder to all of us.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
 And that is the page.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:58.000
 According, this booklet and the page.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000
 So, according, this booklet is 106.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
 And I'm sure many of you already may have heard that.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
 And so this is, as I said yesterday, it was taught,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
 this practice is taught by Pippin Ghanmaba.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:40.000
 Pippin Ghanmaba, his name is known as Kachap Doji or Kachap Dev Doji.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
 Doji, he was one of the very famous karmara reincarnation.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.000
 As I said yesterday, all the karmara reincarnation was very famous.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
 Why they are so famous?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
 Because their realization, achievement, and the benefits are activated.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
 They performed, the old beings.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.000
 And the practitioners, therefore, they saw famous, famous throughout the centuries.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
 And then, Ghanmaba is also known as, all the reincarnations,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
 known as reincarnation or emanation of the Awadokidish or any of these.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:24.000
 And also, Ghanmaba is reincarnation according to, according to 25 disciples

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
 in Gharb and Masambo, there is, I think many of you know,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
 Gharb and Masambo has 25 principal disciples.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
 Among them, there is nine heart-like students.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:44.000
 Among the nine heart-like students, there is particularly when Gharb and Masambo

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.000
 initiated at Heruka teachings to nine students.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:59.000
 And among that, nine heart students, and there is one very famous disciple

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:09.000
 who is practitioners of the Pema family, or Hayagura family, or Amitabha family.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:17.000
 He was connected with Medhala, within Gharb and Masambo's empowerment.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000
 His, this disciple, his name was Yaran Chovin.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
 Yaran Chovin.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:35.000
 Yaran Chovin flower dropped in the west direction of the Medhala of the Pema family.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000
 So that's what he will become, he received entirely at Heruka teachings,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000
 particularly teacher teachings of the Pema family and Hayagura teaching.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:59.000
 He practiced the Hayagura practices, and he become very renowned master of the Pema Heruka.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:06.000
 And Hayagura has horse head on the top of the Hayagura's head,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:14.000
 and this master, because of his realization meditating, the horse head appeared on his head.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
 It's called Yaran Chovin.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
 Look at the illustrations of the twenty-five disciples, there is his.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.000
 So Karmaba is a renowned emanation of the Yaran Chovins.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
 Yaran Chovins is a renowned emanation, and that's how it is.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:43.000
 And so this, between the Karmaba was a very famous Karmaba as all the other Karmapas.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000
 And then he gave a lot of teachings, and he has over ten volumes of the teachings

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
 that he composed and he wrote that.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
 And he was the disciple of the first great saint, first kunto, and many other masters in that time.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
 So this is what Karmaba really, of course you all know that.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
 And now this is Yishim Togya prayer.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
 Yishim Togya is again the mother of all the Buddhas, actually.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
 And why I'm saying this? Here, here, say this here.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
 Dhamma Dhatu here, every good is.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
 And Dhamma Dhatu, summit brother, mother of the old Buddhas.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000
 That's what here, the great master Karmaba said, three, fifteen, the Karmaba said.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
 And Yishim Togya is really great mother, truly.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
 He was, or she is.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.000
 She is of course as well in the teaching, she is also living Buddha.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
 And she did it really fast way.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:50.000
 When he, I mean, in the life story of the Yishim Togya,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
 was revolved by quite three thetongs.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.000
 And particularly, there is a great thetong known as tashyam nudin dorji.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
 Tashyam nudin dorji.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
 And that life story, which translated into English,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
 and they are called sky dancers.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
 Sky dancer.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:20.000
 In the sky dancer, I think that Maishen, Yishim Togya was born

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.000
 in the bird year, in the center of Tibet, in the Kachin family.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
 Bird year, B-I-R-D.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000
 And he met Gaurab and Maasambhava around, according to the teaching,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.000
 around sixty years old when he met Gaurab and Maasambhava.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
 And according to the modern history,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
 Gaurab and Maasambhava came to Tibet

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:58.000
 around mid-sixties of the eight centuries.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000
 So seven in the mid-seventh century,

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
 seven hundred, maybe sixty-three for around that time.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:16.000
 So every Yishim Togya met sixteen years old when he was sixteen years old.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
 So every kind of week followed that sixteen years

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
 and connected to the bird year of the Yishim Togya born.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
 So then I will say he was born in the eighth century.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
 Again, seven hundred in the mid-forties.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
 Seven hundred mid-forties he was born.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
 And how long was Gaurab in Tibet?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
 Over two hundred years, according to the teaching.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
 You can look at that.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.000
 I don't remember exactly the numbers that Maishen did that in the sky dancers.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:00.000
 When Yishim Togya left Tibet, she didn't die.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
 She flew away, flew away.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:12.000
 And after that means, Gaurab and Maasambhava stayed in Tibet about fifty-five years.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.000
 So after that, Yishim Togya stayed over a hundred years.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
 A hundred years, you can calculate.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
 That is just like Raphu.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
 And when she did this, she did this, of course,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.000
 even though there is nothing that she achieved already enlightenment,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
 she already emanation of the Vedas Swarasottis.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
 Or here, as the teaching said, and it is true,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
 she is, in the Dharmakaya level, she is some of the Badri's,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
 or Pandya Paramata, which is mother of all the Buddhas.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.000
 Buddhism said, "Buddhas, how Buddhas reach enlightenment?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
 Because connect with Pandya Paramata.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:08.000
 What is Pandya Paramata? It is great emptiness, true nature, great emptiness."

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:17.000
 What the great teacher, the Buddha Hakkamuni, said, "Those who want to achieve enlightenment,

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:23.000
 Buddhahood, they should contract or practice Pandya Paramata.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
 Those who want to reach the bodhisattva realization,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
 they should practice Pandya Paramata.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:38.000
 Those who like to reach the party of Buddha, individual Buddha, or Rainshaji,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
 they should practice Pandya Paramata.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
 Those who like to achieve the realization of the Arhat, the Shravaka,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
 they should practice the Bodhi, Pandya Paramata.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
 So by practice of all Pandya Paramata,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
 all those realizations are booming up one afternoon.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:06.000
 For that reason, Pandya Paramata has four groups of children.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
 Those are groups of the Buddha, groups of bodhisattvas,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:17.000
 groups of the party of the Buddha, groups of the Shravaka, the Mahavas.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
 So this, therefore, then there is a mother.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
 Not just a mother.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
 Mother, once upon a time, is all the time.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
 And that's what also in hot sutra said too.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
 I think we'll eat.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
 All the Buddhas of the past practice the Pandya Paramata.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
 All Buddhas now practice the Pandya Paramata.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
 All pure Buddhas who come practice the Pandya Paramata.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
 That is known as Pandya Paramata.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.000
 It's an absolute mother, ordinary mother, precious mother,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
 unending mother, forever mother, mother of forever.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
 This is what that is.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
 What is that is Pandya Paramata?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
 It's the essence of compassion, loving kindness,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
 and wisdom of the great emptiness.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
 Because of that compassion of wisdom,

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
 then the Pandya Paramata emanated so many Rupakaayas,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
 poem emanations, such as then,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
 Pimal Buddhas, Five Diamond Buddhas,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
 Vaitya Varahis, and so forth.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
 And then from that Sambho Gaya Buddha,

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
 and then emanated the Nirmaka Gaya Buddha,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
 such as the Twenty-One Taras.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
 And then from the Twenty-One Taras,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
 Vaitya Swara Soti,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000
 I move behind the brace of the Twenty-One Taras.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
 The Second Taras of the Twenty-One Taras

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
 is praised to the, I think, to the Vaitya Swara Soti.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
 That the emanation of the Vaitya Swara Soti is Yishin Sohja.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
 Often in the teaching said that Yishin Sohja,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
 who is the emanation of the Swara Sohja,

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
 why he took the birth or emanated in the Tabith,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
 the middle center of the Tabith.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000
 Because to activate the teaching of the Garpa and Masambha,

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
 to spread the teaching of the Garpa and Masambha,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
 to secure the teaching of the Garpa and Masambha,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
 what would benefit for all living beings.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
 That's why Yishin Sohja emanated,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
 born in the center of the Tabith,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
 and beautiful family, wealthy families,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
 very beautiful families.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
 The moment he was born,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000
 and there is eruption of the spring water like him,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
 like was born and called.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
 And because of that, she is named as Yishin Sohja.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:58.000
 Swami is a Tibetan word, like, L-A-K-E, like Yishin Sohja.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
 The vector is a wisdom of the like.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
 That is Yishin Sohja.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:12.000
 And the moment she is born, she is residing in the teaching.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
 The walls and the consonants.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
 And she is uninterrupted by the womb or the birth.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
 She is so alert, so speechless.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
 At that moment, the earth is started rumbling a little bit,

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000
 echoing the sounds in the different corners of the spaces.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.000
 The divine is happy, the birth of these great Western beings

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
 in the center of the Tabith,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
 in order to secure the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
 and Gurbel Masambhas.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
 Then she grows and has beauty, and youth,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
 and knowledge is just incredible.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
 Everyone wants her hands, according to this,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
 but it is only God.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
 And the moment she is God, and she is so devoted to dharma,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
 and light, and then she connects to the Gurbel Masambha.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
 Ever since, she has become one of the great disciples

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
 of the Gurbel Masambha.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
 Often, in the teaching, she said,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:21.000
 Jai Beitosam, king and a subject and a prince

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
 are the three principal disciples of the Gurbel Masambha.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
 King means king to some devotees.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000
 By me, it means the subject, the subject of the king's own death.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
 And it all means a friend.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000
 Gurbel Masambha is a person, a friend, to become.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
 And her dedication, even though she is enlightened,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
 her dedication and devotion, the power, and the joy,

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000
 and the devotion to dharma is so incredible.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
 You can read the sky dancers.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
 Maybe the dancers or other books, they need so much practice,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
 so much meditation, so much also hardships in the way to the dharma.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:10.000
 Her courage and commitment never will linger, keep continuing.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
 And she becomes then enlightened.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
 Even though she is already enlightened,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
 but she shows us, for us, to achieve the enlightenment,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
 we need your effort, courage and commitment.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
 And devotion, as we discussed earlier, those five different components we need,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.000
 then we can defeat all those obstacles and revert our triangles

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
 that benefit to all the beings.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
 Really, we can do.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
 So this is a great mother.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
 That is a prayer.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.000
 And throughout the years, so many practices, teachings,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
 so many by great thetans and masters,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
 and this is one of the short ones, simple ones, this, this.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
 And then Gaurav Yishin Soja is not just gone.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.000
 Gaurav Yishin Soja ever since is really a prayer to all the thetans.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.000
 And all those good practices, everyone starts saying, "Mother."

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
 Every those thetans, if you read life stories,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
 she appeared in the dream, on the vision,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000
 and actually formed and stopped how to do things,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
 how to do well, how to teach.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
 For example, Satsang Nga.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
 It was around the age of ten.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
 Ten, she came with Dakini's in the dream.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
 He is sleeping in the dream.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
 And she said with that,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
 "This boy, this son, she is the son.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.000
 This son is deluded,

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
 deluded and stained by the negative energies.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
 Now we need to clean."

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
 And Satsang Nga had that dream a long time.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
 She came with some other Dakini's in the dream,

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
 and she is giving birth to Satsang Nga.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
 And cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
 And then she said, "Now clean.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
 Now you just prefer your principal goal.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
 Don't feel sleepy like this.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
 Don't feel sleepy.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
 Wake up yourself.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
 Carry your duty that you promised ancient time

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
 in front of the European ensemble.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
 Now you must carry on."

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
 She said that.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
 And he woke up.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
 When he woke up,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
 the sunlight is already shining in the room

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
 where he is sleeping.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.000
 And he thought, "Oh, it's too late."

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
 But that late, I think, that long,

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
 talked to cleaning his department, whatever.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
 Then he really carried his duties.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
 But these are examples.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
 All those great Tertungs, great masters.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000
 Really, Yikin Surya is active in the old ways.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
 And therefore, always, they said,

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
 "Father and Gurba and Masambhava,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
 Mother Yishin Surya."

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
 And every of those Tertungs have the great teachings.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
 So that is really of Yikin Surya.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
 And now here, here,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
 so Dharmakaya Dhatu, Mother of the old Buddhas,

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
 and then from Dharmakaya Buddha,

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
 and Efid Sambokaya,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
 and Nirmakaya, and Nirmakaya of the Yishim Surya,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
 and the protractors of the Tibetans.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
 And that here, the Tibetan protractors,

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
 but all the practitioners, all the beings.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
 And then, here, the foremost,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
 and the king of the blessed,

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
 the one who grant supreme cities.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
 That is ordinary cities, a supreme city.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
 We already discussed that supreme cities

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
 in the Chisamsanji and Gurumbuji.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
 Sometimes we have to go over anything.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
 And he is the principal dakini,

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
 of the old dakinis.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
 All the dakinis, he is the one,

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
 the principal dakinis, supreme cities.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
 So this Yishim Surya, then I praise.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
 I think same as Shri Praya.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
 Again, we are praying, it's the same thing

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
 with devotion, with confidence.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000
 See, Yishim Surya is embodiment of all Buddhas

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
 and all Dharmas.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
 And what great Master Yimu Nirmakaya said,

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
 when we do the practice of the queen of blessedness.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
 What is it?

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
 He said, you are, in the Dharmakaya level,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
 you are the Samhina Buddha.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
 And in the Nirmakaya level,

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
 you are the Five Pimal Buddhas.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
 And in the Sambukaya level,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
 you are the Five Pimal Buddhas.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
 In the Nirmakaya level,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
 you are Yishim Surya.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
 And that time, Yishim Surya, how is this?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000
 The whole universe is the middle of the Nirmakinis.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
 And all the beings are the emanation of the Nirmakinis.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
 Nirmas and Nirmakinis.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
 And seeing that realization,

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
 purveyor understands with immense devotion, joy,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
 and related with courage and commitment.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
 See, Yishim Surya is embodiment

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
 of all the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru Deva, and Rakinis.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
 And then, same thing.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
 Dharmakaya Buddha, Sambukaya Buddha, Nirmakaya Buddha,

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
 all that dakas and dakinis, the Buddhas,

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
 male Buddhas, Bhoi Pimal Buddhas,

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
 all come together in one single state,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
 as a great mother, humble, kindness,

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
 compared to mother, Yishim Surya, a peer.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
 And he is the transcendent of what is the name of the body.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
 As I said, he never died.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
 He left to bed.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
 To bed, flew away in the sky.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
 If you read that books, that's it.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
 And then, he said, "Here, blessing me."

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
 Then, to all this, I mean, it's basically the same.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
 So, then I don't have to go over that.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
 And so, then, really, ask this.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
 Feel the strong presence of Yishim Surya

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.000
 right in and from sky, sky, and then recursively.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000
 So that, until from this, the first line, the second line,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
 third line, truth, to third line,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
 always object with explaining, object with a rafu,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
 object, Yishim Surya's call it realization, achievement.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
 From that on, then you pray.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
 You're connected to these great beings,

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000
 compassionate beings, to Yishim Surya,

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
 and then you're recursively to what like to be fulfilled.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
 All that.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
 That to ourselves, to all the beings, really.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
 That with beautiful devotees thought,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
 more detailed thought, practice of that,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
 and then is the brilliant practice

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
 of the great Western Mother, Yishim Surya.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
 And that is my brief talk today.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
 Thank you very much again, everyone.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
 Again, participation, and thank you.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
 As I said the other day,

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
 please, not the other day.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
 Yesterday, we mentioned, I'd like to encourage you,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
 you can really practice of this to some side,

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
 at least seven times a day, if you can.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
 And also, maybe three times, seven times,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
 maybe you can do Yishim Surya, pray.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
 It's really just wonderful, beautiful.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
 It will increase all these good things, what I said.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
 Increase, as I said here.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
 And this is what, again, I read this.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
 These were really increasing, increasing what I said here.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
 Here, it will increase, increasing the strength

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
 of life spanish, spanish.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000
 It's said lamas, but it's all of us, so it's lama, isn't it?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
 The practitioners and grant the blessings to despair,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
 the disease, the pain, the fight.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
 It will, and for both the sorceress,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
 the black marriage, we have some notion of the black marriage,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
 the sorceress, or the person, or disturbing something negative.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
 And it will dispel that.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
 And then it will increase, the blessings increase,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
 the long life, the glories, the wisdom,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
 all those of wealth, the estimation,

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
 in the teaching of the Hishon.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
 It really will do those things.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
 And that, do that with the body, that thinking,

 and then one time this Yishimsoja plays, okay?

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
 And if you have this, again, play,
