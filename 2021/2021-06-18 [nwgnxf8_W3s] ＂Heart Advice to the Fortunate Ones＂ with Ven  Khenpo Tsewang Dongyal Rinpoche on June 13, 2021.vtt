00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.760
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much for your participating. As I already said,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 thank you for all your time and effort and for the progress of so many things and to come

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.840
 or participating. Thank you very much for your beautiful dedication to Dharma. And today,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.680
 again, I'm going to continue to talk about teachings on the H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche, which

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.840
 is the simple, direct, but yet so powerful, essence teaching of the entire Buddhas for

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.320
 the practitioners, those who like to be practices. It really has everything. So I'm going to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.680
 go through this as we've been doing, and I'm going to go over this again, where we left

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.600
 last time. We go over this. And again, to do this, and again, always in the teaching of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 the Buddha and the lineage master has often said, when you practice meditating, studying,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 contemplate on the teaching of the Buddha, it's always so important and necessary to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:27.380
 correct the motivations. Our motivation or our intention changes the direction of the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:38.360
 teaching or the practices. In Buddhism, teaching is like nectar. Teaching is like nectar. But

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 ever our motivation is not prepared to receive that nectar, then nectar won't walk exactly

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 as it should walk. So therefore, intention or the motivation is so important. And who

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.480
 controls the motivation? No one else except one's own self. So that means I control my

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 motivation by me. And you control your motivation by you. There's no one else that's not second

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 person. We are, have the full capabilities, right and opportunities. So therefore, since

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.000
 we are all interested, devoted to the Dharma, and therefore, we to make this more meaningful,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.360
 more powerful, more kind of strong and profound impact to ourself. And also some really helpful

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.600
 to the others is the motivation of ourself. That motivation, what are those motivations?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.720
 Of course, we spoke and you all know this, we spoke and you all know, promulgated masters.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.880
 But those are the, this time is simple, is joy and apprehensions. Joy and appreciation,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:05.240
 being grateful, gratitude, being graceful. Second is bodhicitta. Everybody don't bodhicitta

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.120
 the most simple way. It's low in kindness and compassion. With wisdom or intelligence,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.680
 that is bodhicitta. Mind of enlightenment, it has big name, mind of enlightenment. Truly

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.480
 it is mind of enlightenment. When we reach enlightenment of bodhicitta, what will happen?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:39.000
 Our bodhicitta become full bloom, full billions without any restrictions of the dualities

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.920
 and habit patterns. Full bloom of us like full moon of our bodhicitta, that is known

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:57.040
 as enlightenment, Buddhahood. Goodhood. So that started right now. We have that. It's

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:06.680
 our potential, our qualities, our richness. We're revealing that. Why we reveal? Make

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.520
 ourself more profound and peaceful, beneficial and bring peace and happiness, harmony to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.080
 the body. The other means that is what bodhicitta is. Really. There's no other cause or reason

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.320
 or third or fourth causes. Bodhicitta is all one package. That's what in the teaching

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.880
 said. Oh, one technique. One technique, one powerful method. That is what. So therefore,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.040
 again, act very bodhicitta. Our bodhicitta, a lot of compassion has no boundaries or bodhicitta

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.240
 has no boundaries, perversing all the beings of six realms. We went through that. I'm just

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.560
 reminded that to us, to each other, it's not something that you don't know. I'm really

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:03.080
 reminded for us. Really, genuinely, that attitude toward open our heart widely as a sky and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.880
 radiating that energy as a beam of light to every living beings. And we do that. Truly,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:20.880
 we are the very good practitioners. Simple, don't to the ground, but very effective. That's

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.160
 what all the Buddhas, bodhisattvas did. You follow me? Perfectly input examples of the

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.680
 footsteps or there's footsteps. So activated, that was beautiful. And then together with

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:44.300
 this Vadiyana teaching, the purity, the ordinary nature, as everything is, the ordinary nature

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.560
 or reality, where things are. Where things are, reality level, we know the disturbance

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:59.960
 of the duality, habit pattern, everything is purely states. Subject is purely states, object

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.540
 is purely states. Or if I use another terminology, subject is enlightened, object is in like

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.200
 the states. You read those books. I'm sure you already read so many books and the books,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:22.190
 all that we, those in a tantra teaching explaining, right? Things are. So now we're going to

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.960
 embarrassing

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:32.880
 that view, that idea, that philosophy without the interference of the duality or the habit

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:44.680
 patterns, skeptical, doubt, and hesitations. Just without any fear, F-E-A-R, fears jump

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:57.560
 to this view, be in this status, enjoy. This state is full of love, joy, appreciation,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:05.120
 calm, peace, all the emotions, what we have just always disturbed by the emotions. It's

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:15.860
 gone. It's gone. Even there's no trace. That's gone. So that is our really goal, to again

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:25.720
 echo the very energy that started right now. It's not waiting for some time in the future.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.760
 Now is the time to activate that. So those are known as motivation, but same time it

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:42.400
 is our practices, our meditation. These are cornerstones or the pillar of the practices.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.840
 We do some understanding and now we again, with those beautiful motivations and again

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.500
 is just, we try to be all of us in those motivations. You and me, everyone, we are all

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.000
 practitioners.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.640
 We all follow in the teachings according our best capabilities. Please so, activate those

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.480
 from both sides. That means from my side and as well as from your side, activate it. Now

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:18.880
 we go to the His Holiness teachings, that. And now we are in this, again, of course,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:29.640
 this is, in short, page two. Page two and third lines. Third lines we are. So what did

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.000
 the teaching say? This is again the teachings on highlight of the poor treasures of the

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.240
 practitioners. Poor treasures. All for wealth. All for richness of the practitioners. And

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:54.040
 we have these poor in a tact and a precious status. We will be really good practitioners.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:04.360
 We will be truly bodhisattvas. All yogi and yoginis. Truly, not just a name. We are truly.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.960
 Why we know the status many times? Because our these poor treasures are fluctuating up

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:20.160
 and down, up and down, and just all because of our dualities, habit patterns and the distractions

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:31.440
 we engage in the world all the time. And so therefore, if we activate this, then truly

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:40.440
 our practice of Dharma will be always fresh, new, never going to expire our intensity of

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:47.560
 the joy and the appreciations. It will be fresh all the time. Just brand new, it really

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:55.960
 will be brand new. But yet it will develop, progressing. All the realizations and signs

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:04.600
 and result of the practices, the practitioners mentioned in the teaching will shine beautifully.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.560
 It's all shine. As much as it's shining, our heart and mind become calm, peaceful, more

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:19.200
 courage, more commitment, more patient, down to the earth, more humble, more simple, more

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:27.320
 sensible, more common senses. Now, all good things, what we explained and what we're talking

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:35.000
 in the world in the samsara really will come naturally without any effort. Because we're

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.880
 open to the treasures of our own richness, without the interference of the dualities

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.000
 and habit patterns. What is definitely between duality and habit pattern? Habit pattern is

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.920
 created by the dualities. It's not two different species. It's all connected, all created.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.600
 Habit pattern is developed by the duality and then we become more familiar with, familiar

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.560
 of that duality activity, then it becomes the habit patterns, habitions. Then it becomes

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:21.960
 so used to be, so easy. We don't have to make any kind of difficult troubles of the habit

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:29.240
 patterns. It just flows. Why? According to the teaching, our habit pattern is not just

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:38.560
 happened this lifetime. But it was a lifetime. So we have the full baggage of the habit patterns.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:46.880
 We are adding more habit patterns in these lives of that and then we become completely

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:54.440
 saturated, sucked in the habit patterns and the dualities. We don't have to make any effort

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:02.920
 of any of our habit pattern activities, such as emotions, anything. It just comes so suddenly,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:12.880
 so effortless. But on the other hand, our really treasures of the Bodhicata join appreciation,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:22.360
 calm and peaceful. How much we have to make effort? How much we have to make effort? Because

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:31.440
 we're completely weak. Many of, I'm not saying we all, many of us, weak in all of those richness

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:40.960
 because we couldn't reveal enough due to our interference of the ongoing habit patterns

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.960
 and duality activities. So this time, by the teaching of the Buddha, it's actually, it's

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.240
 like the coming on this head sports, shadow sports or head sports. The gracious kindness

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:04.120
 and compassion, wise teacher, Buddha, lighted, shine, sport of this, our habit patterns. So

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.640
 dispel and we built up, built up or rewirling our nature of beauty. Then you become calm

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:19.160
 and peaceful. Those stages, what in the teaching now, named different levels of the Bhumis

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:28.440
 or the path, is a development of how much we're rewirling our treasures, the old and

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:36.160
 the pure treasures. That is what it is. So with those, again, a kind of just a reminder,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.320
 with those reminding of the some points and with this, now we go to the, this fourth point

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:49.040
 or fourth richness of the, of the wealth of the practitioners. Here, what his only, we

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.800
 just said here, as we translated that here, the reduction of the grasping due to the knowledge

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:07.400
 that all compounding things are impermanent. In a bit, what I said here, do re matah lona

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:18.080
 tung wah, tung wah. So that's it, do re. So that do re is translated here as a compounded,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:29.600
 compounded things, things. Matah means impermanent. Lona tung is here translated, reduce the

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.440
 grasping

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:43.320
 and reduce the grasping so to home or to where we reduce the grasping. To all this compounded,

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:58.600
 compounded poems. Why we reducing grasping to the compounded? Because all is impermanent,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 everything is impermanent. This impermanent topic, according to Buddhism, or in Buddhism

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:14.240
 actually, is high light topics. Many times we think impermanent, oh, that's just casual.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:26.000
 It is casual. It is simple. It is basic. But yet it is so powerful, impermanent. And in

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.880
 according to Buddha's teaching, the first his teaching, when he gave the Four Noble Truth

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:40.080
 teaching, this is his teachings, impermanent. Four Noble Truths are, of course you all know,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:48.680
 again I just said these names, suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, cessation truth,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:55.340
 and path truth. Those are the Four Noble Truths. Now maybe you're wondering where is this imper

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.840
manent

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.800
 that we mentioned in this Four Noble Truth. If you look carefully on the book, on the

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:11.440
 teaching, teaching the ancient Four Noble Truth is divided into four subdivisions. Four subdiv

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.400
isions.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:18.800
 The fourth one, for example, suffering truth. What is the division? What is suffering truth?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:26.560
 Really, what is suffering truth? This is more philosophical level or reality level. Suffering

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:36.800
 truth is impermanent. Suffering, and suffering truth is uncomfortable. And suffering truth

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:51.720
 is emptiness, and suffering truth is egolessiness. That is subdivision of the Four, or not four,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:17:05.280
 the first Noble Truth, of the suffering truths. This, again, this first four three impermanent

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:16.880
 and the suffering, or the challenge, and the emptiness, it is, and then, and egolessiness.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:24.320
 Those are the four, four divisions of the suffering truths. This four sufferings, this

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:31.480
 division of the four suffering truths is also another name in the Buddha teaching. Seal

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.920
 of the significance of the Buddhist doctrine is of the Buddha's teachings. Seal, the whole

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:52.760
 mark, or mark, whole mark. Seal, S-E-A-L. Poor seals. What are those? And this is slightly

00:17:52.760 --> 00:18:07.400
 different. All compounded poems are impermanent. All emotions are challenges, and all phenomena

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:17.320
 are preformed. The existing phenomena are all emptiness and egolessiness. Nirvana is

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:29.080
 peaceful. That is, those are the poor seals of the, of the, that significance of the greatest

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:36.080
 compactionist teachers. This is also, these are known as in the Buddhism, lines, roles.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:49.680
 Lines, roles, the role by the lines, those, the jungle kings, lines, roles. Why this name?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:19:00.560
 Because they are true. It's not believing, talks. This is reality, where things are.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:09.480
 You explain that and explore that reality, where things are. That is lines, role. Truth

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:20.000
 is lines, role. Has no, any kind of force. You, every one, one, we can violate that it

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.440
 is true or not. This is not just believing. You have to follow that. Oh, Buddha said,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:34.440
 we follow. That's what in Buddhism teaching said, blindfold following, or following with

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:45.640
 blindfold. Validated that your own cognitions. What kind is true or not? So for example here,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:54.200
 all compounded things are impermanent. Here translated things, but all compounded poems

00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:08.400
 are impermanent. Why? Because they're compounded. They're not there before. It's all combination

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.400
 of the cause and the conditions. And combination of the cause and the condition, producing

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:24.120
 things. Where it's producing is cooperated in perfectly beautiful that which is known

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:32.600
 as in Buddhism, interdependent systems. Interdependent. Interconnected systems. That everything is

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:44.100
 interconnected systems. Everything. What that means? Subject and object, everything is inter

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.600
dependent,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:52.320
 everything's are. Yet it needs cause. It needs conditions. That cause is, there's no single

00:20:52.320 --> 00:21:00.800
 entity causes. Also so many combinations. So many entities come together as known as in

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:12.280
 samsara we call cause. But it has so many entities. So many particles of that. That conditions.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:20.520
 Also not just the conditions. Solid one entity. So many particles. So many conditions are

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:30.360
 cooperated perfectly to that cause. And developing things, coming things, and changing and

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.280
 transforming,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:44.520
 moving forward. And that is known as impermanent. Everything. Therefore, impermanent, there's

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:52.640
 two impermanents. In the samsara, those human beings see impermanent. And reality is happening

00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:01.360
 impermanent. Sometimes translated or in the teaching said, rakma matapa, travamata intubate.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:14.160
 And gross impermanent, subtle impermanent. Gross impermanent, we observe, we all see things.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:20.400
 Or it's changing, or it's changed. When something happens, or it's changed. We see. We don't

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.880
 need any logics or the reasoning. Everybody knows. This is important, logic. But what

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:40.760
 that actually means? It means changing. There's no solid structure or no pulse. P-A-U-S-E.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:54.760
 There's no pulse. Even one second, there's no pulse. Pulse is moving forward. That is

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:05.320
 known as impermanent. Gross level. Everything is really in that status. What that tells,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:19.800
 according to Buddhism, it shows openness, emptiness. It's not true existence. That is illusion.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:29.620
 This illusion between me is bad. It's like magic. We watch magic shows, or this is magic.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:39.040
 But reality, magic is happening all the time. Now what we watch, and as well as watchers.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:47.440
 Watchers that watch, it's all in the magic states. For those reasons, so many great masters,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:55.160
 those were realizations. So less grasping. In his, his own great master, his own, Dunyur

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:05.000
 Bhai said, reduce the grasping. The density of grasping, strength of grasping, reduce.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:17.040
 Because our grasping is so solid. So fixed. Fixed. But where we solid, where, what fixing?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:24.360
 Where we fixed? The reality level, everything is changing. When we fix something, then we

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:33.160
 got to react. Then we got all the mental problems, psychological problems, emotional problems,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:39.320
 everything. Then we get really all those, so many difficult troubles and things. And

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 then that also react to our body and the physical. Everything become kind of like that. It's

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:55.160
 almost unbalanced. Because where it started mostly is, precision of our grasping. Clinging

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:04.800
 to our grasping, what we think that is. Then that. That's what all is. So this is gross

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.800
 empowerment. And gross empowerment is that, as I said, is whole things. The whole, this

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.680
 is like, for example, the day and the nights, and the year and the month. Those we know,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.360
 all this year changing. Month is changing. Day is changing. We think kind of that happened

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 there. But reality, it's happening every second or every instant. Incident, all that happened.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:43.080
 So those are the gross levels. Levels. Everybody knows that. But what we do, what we think

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:50.520
 is only that time happened. Mostly we human beings think when that happened or that happened

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:59.760
 just now, reality according to teaching, according to reasoning, it is really changing all the

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:09.800
 time. So therefore, reduce the grasping. Gradually, reducing the grasping is fundamental practices.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:16.000
 The foundation of our practices. Graspingly. So that is what it will become. Our heart

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.240
 becomes softer, calmer, more peaceful, and more tolerance or more patience. And then

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:34.400
 also love and kindness, a kind of good energy will flow to our streams of the physical,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:42.880
 in the brains of the spirit. Then, subtle empowerment, how the measures, subtle impermanence

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:52.440
 is measured, measured according to Buddhism said, for example, this snapping, one snapping

00:26:52.440 --> 00:27:02.840
 is divided at least 60, 60 portions. This snapping, that is gross levels. So this snapping,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.920
 how they divided this. According to ancient Buddhist logics, logics, for example, if you

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:26.160
 put 60 petals, 60 lot of petals, and you put sharp needle. And when it put that sharp needle

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:35.640
 from the top to the bottom, how long it takes in this, less than this duration of the one

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:45.080
 snapping. That sharp needle went 60 different stages, one up another. It not just happened

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:55.840
 one time at that. Even though we see as an incident happened, but it went 60 times. That's

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:09.080
 the gross levels. Even some teaching said 360 petals and put that. So that means that

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:18.000
 even though it's a second, like this snapping, that moment, how many instances are changing?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.480
 How many instances? How many the second or the moment is changing? It's just flash of

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:37.960
 light. We cannot detect that. We cannot detect it. But reality is changing. That means it's

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:51.900
 not permanent. It's not solid. Solid. It means it's completely openness, changing. This is

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:59.480
 not just only this. In the modern time, maybe we use or I use this. I don't know exactly

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:09.920
 connected that. For example, when we are here and calling to India, India, we go through

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:19.320
 a belief satellite, whatever. But that talk, our talking went and reached one second. I

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:29.320
 believe one second. So that means that one second, how many miles passed? India is not

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:40.200
 right here. And I'm not right in India, but it reached that instant to India. And Vindetto

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:56.740
 is reached to me. Incidentally, what that Mr. is, that means time and distance are illusion.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:04.040
 It's nothing really existed. For those reasons in the Buddha teaching said one instant transformed

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:15.040
 in the eons, eons transformed in one instance. One atom pit whole universe and the universe

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.880
 become one atoms. Those are very sophisticated teachings in Buddhism. See, the very teaching

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:31.440
 is reality. It is, but through this modern technologies, we are simply exploring that

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:40.960
 through technologies. But when we developed our mental capabilities, inner personal capabilities,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.840
 it is more powerful according to the teaching, more powerful, more profound, more vastness.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:57.600
 And therefore always in the teaching making is beyond of the explanations. It's inexpressible,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:06.440
 inconceivable. This is not just a making up things or trying to avoid that reality level.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:14.520
 It's so beyond the conceptions. But who will see that when you reach the full realization

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:23.160
 of the enlightenment, then we see as it is. For those reasons in the Buddha teaching mentioned,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:30.200
 for example, said that like healthy young men, so the moment he extended the arms, that moment

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:41.360
 like accelerate and bend, pull in, put in and pull in, that moment, Mongol putra went

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:48.660
 around the universe, three thousand fold the universe, and they returned back to the same

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:59.360
 sports. Or for example, in Jethavu Groves or Sharastha, one movement of the elbow, healthy

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:10.880
 man or young man, young healthy man, or can be woman too, man and woman. But that moment,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:20.000
 because all in the teaching making, or it is, is beyond our measurement capabilities.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.440
 But more than time, the scientific, we're exploring this some degree of the Buddha teaching

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:36.120
 making, such as talking to the other side of the world, that instant. So where is the

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:47.000
 ground distant in the time? Where that gone? We cannot say, oh, India is right close here.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:56.080
 No. Or no, United States is close to India. It's all, it's all we use. The way things

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:03.400
 are, it's just magical display. But all the way things are appeared on the right level

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:15.000
 is interdependent coordinate systems. All connected, all connected, cooperating, and

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.640
 existing, merging, reactivating, the flow is a continuations. There's nothing will stop

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:30.520
 its continuations. From the beginning time until now, it will move that. But where that

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:38.760
 happening? Oh, that happening within the vastness of space of emptiness, as magical. And never

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:46.480
 lost those entities, our origin flavor of the emptiness. Everything is within this emptiness.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.600
 And for that reason, great teacher Buddha mentioned, poem is emptiness. Emptiness is

00:33:52.600 --> 00:34:03.040
 a poem. That's a true statement. It's true according Buddhism. You can violate it, because

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:10.800
 now we see this impermanent. Where things are, really. Impermanent is so profound, so

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 powerful according Buddha's teaching. When you realize this impermanent, exactly as it

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:29.800
 is, our grasping is gone. Our ego clinging is gone. And our joy and peace are just flashing

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:40.680
 or coming as like spring waters. And everything is also see the emptiness. The flexibleness.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:48.080
 And things are changing. That open space, the flexibleness, there's no blockage. For

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.040
 those reasons, the great Master Maharm would sit. If there is, in the universe, he's used

00:34:53.040 --> 00:35:01.720
 example, if there is such things existing, permanent, one atom. One atom of existing

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:10.040
 permanent is solid without any changing. That will blow the whole functioning system of

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:22.080
 the universe. It will blow that one, one fraction of the atoms is solid permanent, function

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:29.400
 of the whole world. So that means, eventually, that's almost as important. We cannot speak

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:37.360
 to each other. We cannot hear each other's. We cannot smell each other's. We cannot talk

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:46.760
 to each other's. All our senses are blocked because the solids not moving. And then our

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.440
 consciousness and everything. So reality, that means everything's so open, so flexible,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:08.640
 so movement. It's because this flexible openness of this way things are. This is what in Buddhism,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.240
 Buddhist teaching, this impermanent is not just a false statement, or it is not just

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:23.040
 a kind of trying to terminate us. Trying to see things where things are. Exactly. Find

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:30.400
 out exactly where things are. That is our responsibilities. Exactly where things are.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:38.160
 And also, those are the, like, according Buddhist kind of briefly, and just according Buddhism

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.720
 doctrines. This is principles, doctrines in parliament. It is not just a character. Of

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.240
 course, many times, in the teaching, mentioned this poor renouncing a thought, and break

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:57.480
 his body. And impermanent and cause and effect is inevitable. And samsara has a lot of challenges.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:03.480
 We always, those are, we always talk. All is casual. It's all nearing hundred practices,

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:10.840
 all that said. But reality, this is fundamental. Really, so powerful, so special. So special.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.760
 And then when you have the realizations of this, of the impermanent, we will appreciate

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:24.000
 our lives, our friends, our family members, where we are together, as we, in the medulla

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.640
 of the interdependent coordination, we really will appreciate. We thank for every time.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:37.240
 And grateful. We become beautiful human beings. Not flying in the sky, or kind of like going

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.960
 through the wall. I'm not talking of those. But we become beautiful human beings, as Buddha

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:51.160
 helped himself, himself. He was a perfect human being in the level. Humble, simple, drawn

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:58.960
 to the earth. What he said, what he told, he followed with that, even he's enlightened.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.800
 That is what is. And now with those understand, so that really kind of talking about the subtle

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:11.000
 impermanence. Now we talk kind of more practice level, how we practice of this. Always in the

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.080
 teaching said, meditate on the impermanent. Those are in the teaching, great master, what

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:27.960
 he said in the Kamsanilama Shalom, or words of my perfect teacher. That is what teacher

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.480
 said. How you will meditate. And I will list it, and then you will look to the words of

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.800
 my perfect teacher. You can look today. You can look and exactly follow that. I will list

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:46.720
 how he said. The sense of impermanence is so important. Our grasping, clinging is so hard.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:54.040
 It don't connect very well. It really don't connect. It's always like hard balls. Hard

00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:02.200
 balls. It's just like impermanent is the way things are. But our hard ball, ego clinging,

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:10.560
 grasping is hard ball, and it just don't penetrate that to our ego clinging or our grasping.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:17.600
 So therefore, we think more kind of in the practice level, intellectually analytic way

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:24.760
 to remembering of this impermanent. How those are in the teaching said. Reflecting the mind

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:36.000
 to the universe, it is impermanent. Reflecting the mind to the universe. Or if I say world,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:49.760
 W-O-R-R-L-D-R, world. See things. And then secondly, reflecting the impermanent, inhabitant

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:59.760
 of the world. World who lives in that world. And then reflecting the mind, mind of the

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:11.760
 impermanent over all the noble beings. All holy beings. Reflecting. And third, fourth,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:25.680
 reflecting the impermanent over the old powerful persons. Powerful persons in this universe.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:40.240
 And then reflecting the impermanent. And reflecting the impermanent variety of the examples and

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:52.600
 the meanings. And reflecting the impermanent meditation over, over the, and every, our,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:59.400
 then now to, so those are more kind of externally to look into all. But they look to ourself,

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:07.680
 one's own self. Reflecting ourself. Ourself, also meditation on ourself or reflecting the

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:18.000
 meditation to ourself, each of ourself. Self. And the, and the reflecting strongly, reflecting

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.800
 the meditation strongly to the impermanent. So those are highlighted by great master,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:33.920
 the popular, popular movies. In the Kumsnailama shalom or world's my perfect teachers. And

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.120
 so now what that means, I mean, you will know when you read the book, which is a very popular

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:44.840
 book and you will see, but, oh, this means the universe is not permanent. Even though

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:51.960
 it looks so solid, it's so strong and all that, according Buddhism, it came. It's here

00:41:51.960 --> 00:42:01.720
 now, but it will go away according Buddhism. Really going. So all this universe is subject

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:11.960
 within the impermanent. And then all the beings who lives in this world, they are not all permanent

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.000
.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.160
 How many things, generations, civilizations changed that we read his stories from the

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:24.640
 beginning time as recorded. All the stone age, iron age, all those so many, many really

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:32.680
 explanations that you all know. That means it changed. It went one after another. And

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:40.960
 all inhabitants and different countries and how many things changed? There's no ever existing

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:50.440
 anything generally thinking of this all inhabitants of the being. And then we've called the holy

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:56.400
 beings. That means such a great beings, those beings or those in the accord in the teaching

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:04.920
 we like story we read, they flew in the sky. They transformed fire into the water, water

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:17.960
 into the fire. One item for many items, many items, one pieces. They changed. They have

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:26.160
 such a, those capabilities, capabilities. And there's a story in the world, my perfect

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.680
 teacher, whenever you look that there's like one more time, Malarepa is doing meditation

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:39.000
 on the caves, caves. I'm not want them. When Malarepa is meditating in the caves, some

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.840
 hundreds came because he's not moving at all, not doing any responding, not moving at all.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:54.640
 They thought, they thought is kind of demons, something very kind of also the very strong

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:02.200
 looking that. And they come closely and they are again trying to speak with never corresponded

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:10.120
 or responded. And then they hold and throw in the, in the cliffs outside. And moment

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:17.720
 they throw, great master come back to the same sport. They did many times like that.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:25.320
 So they couldn't do anything in end. So this is one of the examples of that. And there's

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:32.520
 so many stories of the Buddhism and as well as other religions too. There's so many stories,

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:40.760
 those holy beings really perform so many unbelievable activities. They have power, they have

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.440
 capabilities.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.800
 Mostly everything is under their command, their wishes, but yet all become as merely

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:57.520
 historians or merely in the memories, one after another. There's no exceptions. How things

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:05.080
 that. And then in the teachings, the power of religion teaching said, said all the power

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.560
 of beings, reflecting the power of beings, how they are like, well, they are ruling,

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:20.120
 well, they are alive. The whole world is trembling of their powers, their dominance, their

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.560
 identities,

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:29.960
 their stentors. But then, left so quietly. So that's it. There's nothing can prevent

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:37.760
 them. They can't go. So that way, check after one after another. Really it's so clear. So

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:45.840
 this is the way the world is. That's the way all the subjects are, objects are. This. For

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:56.120
 that reason, reason, he always said, reflected the impermanence. That is not just making

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:07.320
 us a burden, but we are light, light and shedding on our dark corners of the knowledge. We think

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:13.200
 so. It really will help. So now with this, again, what he said, when you have the realization

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:20.480
 of the impermanent, we need to understand, then our Dharma practice will go smooth. We

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:26.880
 are grounded. When we joined what's called four garlands of the teachings by the Gampopa

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:42.320
 and the Lungchimpa, one said, may my mind turn to the Dharma. Why this statement is?

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:49.360
 When you have the realization of this poor, this impermanent, and with all of those theories,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:59.400
 your mind is really like intro to Dharma. The prayer is answered. That time, mind, we see

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:07.160
 it truly as it is. So what that will become? Our mind or our heart become more subtle,

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:16.200
 calmer, peaceful. As I said earlier, when that happened, all our wisdom begin to shine.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:23.160
 We become more sensible, with full common senses, more kind, more love and compassion,

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:31.400
 more kind to ourself, one's own self, kind to the others. That is, then he really is

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:41.320
 harmonious peace. Then it can't be done. Everything comes so perfectly. And so that is what is

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:48.560
 really impermanent. But again, now I go. This is what I've listed as a great master, great

00:47:48.560 --> 00:48:00.080
 master, his only dungeon said. First is devotion. Second is the affection to the Sangha

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.680
 practitioners.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:10.320
 And the third is compassion and loving kindness to all the beings of six realms and then always

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:19.120
 have less graspings, trying to less graspings. And because intellectually, on a practical

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.280
 level, nothing is really lasting forever, therefore more calm and peaceful, open heart,

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:33.080
 relaxed, and not so tense with anything that we just can't more relax. And if we do that,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:40.560
 it will really make, then our, as I said, our mind will turn to the Dharma, remind it, turn to the

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.000
 Dharma,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.240
 then what it will bring? It will bring calm and peaceful. Then that is also in the Buddha teaching

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:55.800
 named the discipline, one's own mind. This will discipline one's own mind. What in the end with

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:01.960
 which I always, that is my teaching, what the gracious teacher said. That is my time teaching.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:10.600
 Teaching, when your mind is tamed or when our mind is tamed, then we touch the essence of the

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:16.920
 teaching and we are touching to the essence of our heart and our nature. Then all the

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:23.240
 realization and progress really will come so beautifully and perfectly. And that is my talk

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.440
 for today. Thank you very much again for the participation. And again, thank you very much.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:35.640
 And I just thought to tell you that the studies change schedules. Next Sunday, we won't have

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:41.960
 teaching or my talk will be postponed to the following Sunday. And the next Sunday is the

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:48.920
 anniversary of the, our great teacher, Kentin Pardin Rambo, he's a Mahaparin Rana. What?

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.520
 - Friday the 19th. - Oh, Friday the 19th. Sorry, sorry. I mixed it up. - Saturday the 19th. - What?

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.360
 - Saturday the 19th. - Saturday the 19th. So we won't have the

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:04.280
 teaching. Saturday the 19th, we won't have the teachings, okay? I thought we'd change that

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:10.760
 schedules then. And thank you. Then we have the practice, of course, practice and commemorating

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:17.080
 of the anniversary of Kentin Pardin Rambo, which is Mahaparin Rana. Thank you very much everyone

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:23.000
 for the presentations. And now we do short dedication that concluded our first session.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.280
 And then we started our practices, healing practice. Thank you.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:39.560
 - Again, if you have this booklet and it's very beginning. Beginning, we're going to do one short

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:53.800
 phrase. That is page 23, 32, sorry, 32. Page 32. By this merit, may all obtain the omission,

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.920
 may it be defeated that enemy wrongdoing. From the stern webs of the earth, all you need is

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:07.560
 sick of the death. From the ocean of the samsara, may I pray you all be.
