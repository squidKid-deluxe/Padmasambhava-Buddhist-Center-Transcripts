00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The mind of mind is embodiment of fire. Dhamma Dhatam, that we often hear in the teaching here,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Dhamma Dhatam's wisdom is Buddha Verochanas, Dhamma Dhatam's wisdom.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And then, Merelya's wisdom is the Buddha's way of suffering, or the acrobatic.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 And all the economic wisdom is Dharana Sambhas. And then discrimination awareness wisdom is the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.000
 Buddha Amitabhas.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 All a complicated wisdom is, is the Amogasithas.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 So that means those wisdom, when they are actively arising as the display of the poem,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 then they appear for those different Buddhas.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 This acrobatic wisdom is the first wisdom, Dhamma Dhatam's wisdom is the Buddha Verochanas.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 That didn't mean they don't have other wisdom.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Each of those wisdom has all the five wisdom, too.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.280
 That's what's called the acrobatic five, the Dhyana Buddha, are surrounded by different five Dhyana

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 Buddhas.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Display, that's what in the teaching often said, it said 100 Buddhas, all those Buddhas.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.540
 And even they said 100,000 Buddhas, it's a display of the wisdom arising the poem of the poems and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000
 enlightenment things.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And the wisdom, when we start talking wisdom, wisdom is not just a wisdom.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Wisdom is completely saturated, combined with compassion and loving-kind thoughts.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 All the beings, infinite love and compassion.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Now we bring down all the, where there is five Gaya, where there is five Muslims,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 where there is five Dhyana Buddhas, where is that all?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's all within our nature of the mind, or nature, our nature of the mind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Where that is residing right now, according to the teaching,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 or in the teaching, in our heart center.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 That is all residing in our heart center.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.250
 Our nature of the mind, our mind, nature of the mind, embodiment of the five Dhyana Buddhas, all

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 enlightened.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 All is all in the Buddha.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Buddha summon the Buddha. And therefore, teaching mention, don't look to Buddha anywhere else.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Your nature of the mind is the Buddha.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Don't search to anywhere.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Every searching and trying to looking Buddha like to find somewhere,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 you will never going to find anything except your own mind.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That doesn't mean there is no Buddha Amitabha, there is no other Buddha.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 But there are, according to the individual, rich enlightenment.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni also become the Buddha.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Because Buddha walk for three countless years, rich enlightenment.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 There is many Buddhas in every different direction.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 But if you are trying to look to find, to also get Buddha,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 we have to search Buddha from within.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Look Buddha within.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Buddha is right here, that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And that is to start with that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Then, then, pause, we start with meditation.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So to do meditation is, we discover it all in an absolute Buddha.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 All the Buddhas summon the Buddha or the Dharma Dattu.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Vastas. Vastas.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Always we discover that Buddha.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 We discover all the five Dhyana Buddhas.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 That means, we, when we reach enlightenment, in the teaching of offering center,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 teaching we said, we reach enlightenment.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 You, your environment becomes pure land, pure land of that.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So that means, we just become the Buddha.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And all our environment is become pure land.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And all our display of the wisdom becomes the display of the five Dhyana Buddha,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 or five Vistas, or five Chayas.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 So five Chayas, five Vistas, five Dhyana Buddha is within us.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 We are all accomplished or completed without qualities.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Within us, that.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So therefore, here is it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 See that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And again here is it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Therefore, so everything, yeah, yeah.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 This is the, so that nature.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 To discover that, we start with from the discovering of the innate nature of our own mind.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Nature of this great intellect.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Why we have to do that now?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And that is according to the two teachings.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Because we started just looking to the other, those different colors.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 We created dualities.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 That duality becomes then heinous for our realization.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 For that reason, tattoo is so powerful because immediately it cuts the duality conception,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 touches the goal of the true nature and be connected to that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And when we discover that and call it this, then we apply to some Toga practices,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 become really very powerful and very effective, effective in that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So now, for that reason, here.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Here, again, the great Master Shambhata Rana says.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So how to discover that?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 I mean, we already discussed it, any, any two.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And you already know that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Many of you already know that.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 But to discover that.
