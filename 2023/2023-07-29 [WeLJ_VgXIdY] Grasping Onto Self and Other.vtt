00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840
 "And because the first ego is individual ego, that means clinging to our own self as I, individual

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.000
 ego, that's called individual ego.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.050
 And so the second ego, our ego or I, is clinging to the old poems and object as their entity or

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.000
 they are existing, existing.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.290
 So that is called object ego, a phenomenal egoless, that I'm now translating. I'm sure you have

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.000
 better translations and you maybe know that and also in the commentary you can look at.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.830
 The post-egoness is here, here says that, "Shout, beggar of the spirit knowledge of the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:04.520
 discrimination wisdom, destroy the morning of samsara concept of the self, selfhood, who the root

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.000
 of samsara is self grasping."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So self grasping, maybe that's the better translation, self grasping, self grasping to the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 phenomenon, so true grasping.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So now here says, "What is this sharp, regular spirit knowledge of discrimination?"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.210
 Generally, Buddha teaching is teachings of compassion and wisdom. As a union, compassion and wisdom

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 equally.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 But then, to understand the perfect meaning of the way things are, we need wisdom.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.760
 So Buddha also teaching is worship teaching. That means because the Buddha taught what exactly way

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.830
 things are, Buddha not added any extra that is not there or not in the fundamental level or

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 anywhere.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.120
 But just simply discover with truth or with how it is. That's called truth. To understand it, that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.000
 is then wisdom, discrimination of wisdom.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.660
 And here says, "The sharp, regular spirit knowledge of the spirit knowledge discriminates our

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.000
 wisdom."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.910
 That means looking thoroughly to all the aspects, everything, and particularly this time, looking

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.000
 thoroughly to the self, ego, self.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.960
 Self is so important or ego or self is so important in samsara. We all need perhaps self and ego is

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.000
 so important.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And here also making the ego, selfish or ego, ego is the root of samsara.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So ego is the root of samsara. But root of ego is what? Ignorance.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The ignorance starts with grasping. Grasping to the self, grasping to the object.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Grasping to the self is ego, what's called? Grasping to the self, grasping to the object.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.540
 And now ego is, therefore it is really all the troubles in the samsara that we go through,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.000
 individually go through.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Us in the troubles in the samsara going through, everyone is because is ego.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.820
 For that reason, great master Chandideva said in his teaching that all the troubles, all the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.000
 difficulties, all the chaotrains is all started from the ego.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 The ego is the biggest demon ever existed. It made trouble in the past, not it making trouble now,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 it make trouble in the future.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Therefore, why I should keep this trouble maker? The biggest trouble maker should uproot that.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So, I mean, that's what Chandideva said, the Buddha said too in the Buddha teaching.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 You think it's true or not? Everything good and bad and hope and pain, all start with the ego.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.710
 And one is suffering. What a very master, Chandra Giddi said, the moment I cling to myself, that

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.000
 moment you have, in a way, let a rejection to the others.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Self-attraction and let a distance to the others.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Be it when the attachment and the self-distance, all the troubles arises.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Where that started goes a clinging, that clinging comes from the ignorance.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And here, he said also, he said, destroy the mountain of the samsaras.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.630
 That the concept of the sakur. In the Buddha teaching, he said, where we are holding this, like,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.000
 where we are this holding of the ego.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.220
 Generally, in Buddhism, ego is, of course, on the relative level, on the conventional level,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.000
 Buddhism or the Buddha is not denying that we don't have ego.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 We can call ego, or I, we can call I. Even Buddha himself said, I am sitting in the Varanasi.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 I am sitting on the kushina, or I am sitting on the kharastha in the Jeddah groups.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 I give these teachings this and that. That's the conventional level, relative level.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And that is the support to you, to communicate it to the others.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 But it's not something Buddha knows because it exists, it's already a truth existing.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 This is common, also called relative levels.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 In the relative level, there is true relative truth in it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 The used for relative truth, unused for relative truth.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Used for relative truth is such as all this. What is all relative?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Unusable relative truth is such as dream, mirage, reflection, moon in the water.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.720
 Even though they appeared, it don't function exactly as moon, as exactly the image, the reflections

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.000
.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Those are the unused for relative truths.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 But ego is even in Buddhism. Even if it's not in that near, I is.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Because it's not really existing. It's not existing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It is the phenomena that we input by the conceptions.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 We hold onto that.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It's not something existing as like this furniture or this cup.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Or it's not just in the existing reflection in the moon and the water.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 But even though it's not existing, it is the troublemaker as in the teaching.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 He said it's true.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 All the trouble that comes from and for that reason, I said mountain, mountain.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Samsara. Samsara stands up with ego.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 What is samsara?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 We all know. Of course, we call it samsara.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Samsara is emotion and karma.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Negative emotions and karmas are the cause of this samsara.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 The very fundamental cause of samsara.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And then what it means is suffering.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Or changes, all chaotics.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Those are known as suffering truths.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 God's gracious teacher, brother, give the teacher, force the teaching.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 All of the suffering truths, suffering truths.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 That's samsara.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Where that started, from the ego, from the grasping, from the ignorance.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And that means prevail.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 It's from nothingness actually. It came from nothingness.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 It's our mind. We went through those teachings and you know that.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 It starts with mind. Mind is empty.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Our mind is nothing that really exists that we can all figure out, as discussed.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 But it all starts from this.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Start on this. And this is where we cling in this.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 This. We have been clinging this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Then it's to the ego.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 We cling it to our self.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 We cling in the teaching always.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 We cling in self to our five aggregates.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 We don't need any true reason, reason.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 We grasping, cling it to the five aggregates, all the aggregates.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 We cling it to the aggregates without any reason, without any proof.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 We just hold. This is just a belief.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 It's not something that exists in the whole.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 That is what in the teaching he said.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 That aggregates, what the aggregates.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Aggregates are five aggregates. We are all good. Home aggregates.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Perception aggregates, mental formation aggregates, and then consciousness aggregates.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Those are five aggregates.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Those aggregates are existing on the preliminary level.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 It is all "I", even though there is no true substantial entity existing.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But yet it is all.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 But ego is nowhere that we can find.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Anywhere or "I", that's so important what it is.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 It's only, as they say, phenomena that input by our consumption,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 our mind, and holding continuously.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 True or not, you're American.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And the Buddha teaching said, as he said, "The discrimination ever, ever is again."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 The regular teacher, the Buddha said, "Not just believe what I said."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 You examine. We have to reveal the truth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Not just believe or the kind of presumption that was.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And reveal that nature.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 So the aggregates, we think that kind.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Without any reason, or when the teaching is done,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 without analyzing, without investigation, we just presume,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 "Oh, my aggregates, me, like this kind." We always think.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And so we always commonly think.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 If target "I" is target video, or "South" is target video, five aggregates.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 "South" is target in the other grade teachings, in the philosophy teachings.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 "South" is aggregate, then there is five aggregates,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 and there must be five "I"s.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Nobody believes in the Buddha, won't see what they have, five "I"s.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 It's everything one.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And then we look to the poem aggregates.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Poem aggregates is not just one piece.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 It's so many components with poem aggregates.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And the Buddhism often said, four causal poems.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Fire, water, wind, earth.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And five result poems, five senses, five object senses, all together.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Ten, sorry, all together, putting on them.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 So, as the poem divided, grosser level, and to potent,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 we won't believe there is potent ego's "I"s.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 It really was thing one, one.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And then, feeling aggregates.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And always we said, for example, we always kind of connected our poem with "I"

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 or "I'm sick, I'm, my body is sick, I sick, I sick."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 So, it's kind of connected with body.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Then, it's feeling also, you see.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 "Oh, I feel not happy. I feel great."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 And it's connected to the feeling.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 But we have feeling.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Feeling is generally in the direction of change of Buddhism.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 So, there is four, like three feelings.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Good feeling, bad feeling, neutral feeling.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And that then, divided with the six senses.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 "I", "a", "nose", "tongue", and "mind", "book", and "body".

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Six senses. So, all together, eight different feelings.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 But we don't believe. Again, there are eighteen different "I"s or egos.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And so on.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Then the perceptions of conceptions.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Conceptions in names and labels.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Again, there are so many conceptions, so many perceptions, labels, so many.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 And there are not many, that we don't believe egos.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Then come to the mental formations.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Mental formations, also, the aggregate has that,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 quoting, so, 51, sub-guru, the greatest teacher.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Mother Chagarman, sub-guru, 51.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And you can read all those. I'm sure you know all that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 And also, you can read if you like to know those.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And, again, when you look to the way, is "I" to this 51 mental state?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's none of it. Everyone, 51, will say, "I'm not ego. I'm not I. I'm not ego."

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 They're all kind of like egos. No. Really, they do not exist at all.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Then the consciousness. Add consciousness.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Again, it's the same.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 So, where is ego? This.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And then, with this, here, say that.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 So, therefore, therefore, if we uproot,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 there's not existing any ego, ego or existence,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 then we are demolishing or destroying the mountains of the samsara.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Samsara.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 The mountain is, of course, stable, solid, strong, big.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 The greatest teacher, Buddha mentioned, always, in the teachings,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 mentioned in the Vinaya teachings,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 those great arabas, when they reach, or arabahood,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 they said they destroyed 20 bricks of the mountain.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 The mountain completely destroyed.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Destroyed. And now, they're totally free from

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 the mountain of the egos, completely destroyed,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and now they're free from the samsara.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 What are those?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 20 points.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Those are in here. Then we go here, I think, in the way of kurvata.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So, this one. The root of samsara is subgraspa.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 I think that I mentioned that we are now, we're dead.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And then, that's monotony.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 That's monotony examined.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Examped that arising, abiding,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 and going nominal destination, and substances,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 to settle, precisely, that there is best-less emptiness.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Best-less emptiness, and it is the asserting,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 individual subnocence.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So, that is really establishing, then, the egolessless state.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 There is no existing egolences.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And this mountain, 20, of course, I just mentioned 20,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 there's a mountain. But, truly, those mountains,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 that when you're examined, in the teachings, again,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 those texts, the teachings, those teachings,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 when you examine the ego, the ego, for example, here.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Here, he said it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 The normally, the mentally examined arising,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 where ego comes from, first step.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Where that ego came.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And we started looking to the source of the ego,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 exactly place where it comes from.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 It does not really come from outside,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 inside, any place.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 That means the outside, such as those objectives,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 those elements, any places.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And then, from where that comes from, to all the aggregates,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 there's none of those come from, any place.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 So, there is no, ego has no source.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And that is, of course, this technique is more of a jocchi technique,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 or more easy way to technique.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 There is the clinger on the ego has no source.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 When you look to any place, this source is free.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 So, therefore, ego has no source.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 And then, here, there is also, when you examine the ego,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 there is no place of the ego existing.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 We mentioned, our end, a little bit really over there,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 is not existing on the five aggregates.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 But then, in more detail in philosophy teachings,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 in the book, it is divided four ways.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Every ego is not existing on the five aggregates.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Then, second option is ego, I existing, side by side,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 with the aggregate and ego.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Side by side.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 So, that means two individuals, ego and aggregate.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 The first is, examine where ego in the five aggregates.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 We see there is no ego in the five aggregates.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 And the five aggregates, the ego existing,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 that again, in the teaching, say that, or maybe didn't make it,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 that five aggregates are environment.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Its component is instantly changing, five aggregates.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Instantly, but ego is not changing.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Ego is not changing, always thinks ego.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 "I" is the same.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 So, there is not, not ego is not without,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 with five aggregates, or ego is not in the five aggregates.
