NOTE     "synopsis": "PSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat\nChetsun Nyingtik\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nPadma Samye Ling retreat center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 2\nApril 17, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 In generally practicing Dharma, we need courage, commitment, joy, and loyalty. Loyalty means

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.720
 "stay strong." That is the Onodoki teaching also said. For example, Garab Dogya's three words,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:27.440
 "word," "discovered in the nature." Second is "resolution," or "one resolution," or "one

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.600
 decisiveness." That means not lingering, not jumping back and forth, all different things.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.160
 Stay with that. That's what the teacher said with teaching what he received. He got enlightenment.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 And all the great masters, there is a time to linger. There is a time to search him.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.760
 But life is short. We cannot search him all the time. We have to settle.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:06.480
 Settle with the loyal. That is loyalty. Practice the meditate. That will bring the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.640
 realization. There is no one got enlightenment. No one achieved the Chichi, the Buddhahood,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.640
 by just receiving the teachings, looking at the teachings. Definitely, it has a big merit,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 accumulation merit. It's a big merit, but you get realization. Once you receive the teaching,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.760
 once you settle yourself, when you have to, we have to give our heart, heart and the practice,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.480
 then the really performant realization comes. And then if we do that, we leave this world,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.800
 world with joy, with confidence, with some degree of our focus.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.840
 Otherwise, it's all lost, almost the same as we start.
