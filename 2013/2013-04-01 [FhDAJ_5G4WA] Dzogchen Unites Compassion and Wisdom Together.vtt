00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040
 Good morning everyone, welcome everyone. Again, we restinten our beautiful motivation of Dzorchen

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.000
 and appreciation,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 and as well as, again, particularly again, this is the teaching of the Buddha.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 As you heard so many times, this teaching is the essence of the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamunu.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Buddha gave so many teachings that found as 84,000 teachings, all nine years after teaching.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.160
 This Dzogchen teaching, what we try to do in practice and talk, is the essence of the essence of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 the essence of that teaching.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 And therefore, we are one of the very fortunate and lucky.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 We have this opportunity to engage, to deepening and touching the nugget enlightenment quality

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 right here,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 without long distance, detour in different ways. It's really wonderful, it's special.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 As long as we have the appreciation, and we follow the Buddha's teaching, this is what it is.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 There's nothing higher, better, deeper, more profound, more special than this.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 And we actualize that with our joy and appreciation, the joy for effort and devotion.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 Truly, this is what the God of Dzogchen practice, rich enlightenment, many hearing method practice,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 rich enlightenment.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Here is our practice, the enlightenment, rich enlightenment.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.700
 All those great master lines, and we have been words, everyone practice this one and rich

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.000
 enlightenment.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Today, we are in the same path, same spirit, same level of that teaching, we are following that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And therefore, there's every reason to bring joy and appreciation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 This is not just for accidental, that we are connected with this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Truly, this is our inheritance. Today, we are reconnecting back to that inheritance, that trick,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 the inheritance of our forefathers and mothers, their teaching, their practice, their legacy, their

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 truth.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And therefore, it is very important to strengthen, activate and preserve that with joy,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 appreciation,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 and love and devotion, with graceful, grateful. Those are also in samsara we need.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 It's not just in the dharma, we have those qualities, what we call, those are decent guys and girls

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.000
.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Those are the decent couples who have those qualities, joy and appreciation, gracefuls.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 For those who don't have even, they are worse than dogs, drugs, that's what we call.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Therefore, re-strengthening this quality and importance and then practicing is our responsibility,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 our inheritance, our destination, our goal.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So therefore, re-strengthening that with, again, joy and appreciation and devotion.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And with contrast with that, as a great master always reminded us,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 re-strengthening of the vastness, motivation of the bodhicata, and skillful means motivation of the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 very unattain,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 combined to it, because today's our teaching and practice is the very unattain, the essence of the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.000
 teaching.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.260
 Therefore, with vastness, motivation of the bodhicata, we combine this skillful means motivation of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.000
 the enlightenment,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 combined to it, then it makes perfect sense, perfect practices.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Without the general opening the teaching heard that we practice, I mean we heard so many times,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 without the compassion, without the loving kind in the compassion,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 no matter how much profound that teaching is, it won't bring the result.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 We have to practice, our dzokki practice has to be tender.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Our teaching practice, dzokki teaching has to be soft, gentle, smooth, appealing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.130
 That is compassion, that is love. Otherwise, dzokki practice will become dry, dry, just a hundred

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.000
 percent.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 But that makes sense. Therefore, for those reasons, I mean again, many teachers, masters often say

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 it,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 and we heard so many times from the great master, kekki padish hara luchas.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 The compassion is so important.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 The essence of this is the essence of the word of teachings, actually.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 When you have the compassion, there is no suffering, no difficulties, no troubles,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 because the nature of compassion is great, great, blessfulness.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Great blessfulness is free of the suffering, the difficult troubles.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It makes it tender, it makes tender heart, soft heart, open heart, relaxed and calm,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 consideration, understandable, all those follows with this compassion combined together

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 with the great enlightenment, dzokki practices, all the skills we need more of it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So those are important to understanding.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Again, we understand that with that foundation, with that platform, with that stadium,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 then we are going to lift up in the dzokki practice, dzokki practice,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 which is, again, combination of the compassion and what's the united target.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 That is what dzokki practice is.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 That is our lifting up, the enlightenment, or lifting up the realizations.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And now, with those thoughts, and we follow the text itself.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Again, this text is the teaching of the Buddha and the teaching of God.
