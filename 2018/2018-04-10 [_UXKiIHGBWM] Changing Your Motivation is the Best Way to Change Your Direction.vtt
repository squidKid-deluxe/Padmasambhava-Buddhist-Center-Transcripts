00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 "Beautiful, very gracious moment in our life. We are reflecting our beautiful nature, that we all

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 inherit it. That's what we are reflecting, trying to regal our mind, trying to polish it, and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 bright up and shine that to benefit ourselves, to all the beings, according to the instruction,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 teaching of the Buddha Kedamani, as well as the Gopin Masamala.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.380
 All the lineage masters that they taught, we are following in their footsteps with the best cover

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 of a job, an appreciation, and a devotion, and humility, or the humblest, where we follow that. And

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 that is again wonderful and beautiful.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.400
 And for that reason, again, the Dharma practicing is, the Dharma practicing is the practicing of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.990
 the mind, focused on the mind, not focused too much on the body, not too much focused on the mind,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.000
 sorry, speech, focused on the mind.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.340
 Why is that? Because when you, when we are focusing, working with mind, naturally it will reflect

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.000
 to the body and speech. So therefore, we are cultivating the mind, call it mind.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 When you call it mind, revert as beautiful, calm, peaceful, soothing, and calming, and nice, and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.000
 wonderful, and naturally it will reflect to the body, it will reflect to the speech.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So now we are going to the root of the root of the cause, all how we will make change, and how we

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 make to glorify that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.540
 For that reason, every teaching, all the time said at the beginning, not teaching, practice two,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.000
 practice teaching, every practice, we should always correct our motivations.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.520
 Motivation is the instrumental, motivation is the ground, motivation is the fundamental, where we

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.000
 like to change our direction and our vision.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.260
 We don't change our motivation, our direction will be not changed. It's not going to make any big

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.000
 difference. Therefore, motivation is so important.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.900
 For that reason, we correct our motivation. What we should, again, that means what? We have so many

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.000
 motivations.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.900
 There are billions of trillions of motivations that really has all of them. But among that,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.000
 something beautiful, beneficial, good for me, good for other beings,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 that is what we do, activate that motivation. And that motivation starts with joy and appreciation.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.200
 Joy and appreciation is the dawn of enlightenment, the dawn of the Buddha's nature, the dawn of the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.000
 self-born primordial awareness or primordial wisdom.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.070
 So joy and appreciation. We have so many reasons, we have so many good causes and conditions to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.000
 bring joy and appreciation.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Every day, start a precious day. Every day is, in a way, new life. Every time is beautiful moment.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 We should be grateful, grateful, thankful, grateful. And that is the beginning of the practices.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Read that thought, and then, the both each other. Comparing the thought for all living beings,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 there are always vastness, motivation of the both each other, every living being.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And then, to get ready, we are already understanding of the Dokki teaching as expoundant.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 The entire universe, the world, is totally in a three-kind manner, so bring that qualities.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 There are no realizations, because we are really going to practice the Dokki teaching.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Practice that, so that means there is something, not something that we don't have in the outside,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 we are trying to get that.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.180
 That is not the case in the Dokki teaching. We have all, everything is inherited, every beautiful,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.000
 everything is inherited.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 We did not recognize. We completely cover up by our own mistakes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Today, we have discovered that beautiful nature.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.350
 For that reason, we strengthen that beautiful understanding of the realization of Dokki teaching as

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.000
 three-kind mandalas.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 So those are known as the motivations. With those motivations, then we go to the Dokki teaching.
