00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 It is not functioning or the stuff that dissolves. The wind element is when it is dissolved to the

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.980
 consciousness, then the skin is called your diet, external, most of the times.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:26.100
 But in the teaching said, sometimes due to the karma, due to the certain conditions, feel for all,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.980
 even can come back, come back.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.960
 I don't know how long they came, how that stayed. Maybe those great Delos, little bit, Delos, those

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 who come back after the death, maybe this stage, they went and then they come back.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 There is many great beings called Delos, they died, but they come back.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.750
 Now open up by you say, well they did you say, they died, breathing stopped, but still they have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.980
 some warmth in their heart.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:13.300
 Heart, and so that really happened. There is quite renowned Delos, their teachings still existing,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.980
 and it is quite popular in Tibet.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 Tibet, and there is quite few of those, they are called Delos, Delos.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 So now this is the externally that individually is died.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.880
 In the teaching said, even during these times, you are going all these stages, these stages

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.980
 actually again,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.980
 "Guruppe Masambha Ghee", "Guruppe Masambha Ghee", "Buddha Ghee" this teaching is as I said before,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 in the kind of like we are marking the road signs.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.400
 Road signs, so that we can refer, reverse it. Reversing our practice, we can resten in our

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.980
 meditation.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 Each time it comes, now we are reaching to that stage, I should resten in our practice.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:12.980
 Meditation of realization, meditation on the complete stages, all body, joy, appreciation, all that

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.980
.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 And the pose for us around you, around that individual, try to support continuity without any

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.980
 emotions.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 And crying, this and that, and such a kind of protective voice, "Have you died? What will you do?"

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 And the police, trying to stay more and all these things, it's destructive.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.000
 It's just not going to help anything. It's destructive, it is pulling their concentrations,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.980
 completely disturbing.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.110
 So therefore, when you see, individually see those signs, excellent signs, they should continually

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.980
 support their spiritual beliefs as I said before.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 And individually, who are experiencing these things or practicing this, they should each time rest

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.980
en in their quality, confidence, meditation and practices.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.980
 That is really what we need to do, resten them, our quality, confidence, realization, all that.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.400
 Now is the time. I practice, I meditate in my life, I did good things, now I'm going from forward

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.980
 to this.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 This is the pose practice always good, always we can talk.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:33.110
 But this is one of the crucial time that I'm going to carry on and move this, this with briefly

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.980
 that I will make that.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:49.350
 I'm really thinking, these signs of those inner, civil signs, mirage and smoking, fireflies and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.980
 light,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.750
 then those many times, in the teaching, I mean not many times, those are known as the clay-like

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.980
 luminosity signs.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 Signs of the clay-like luminosity states, they are the expression of the Buddha nature.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:14.470
 Expression of our ordinary, mother-clarity luminosity status is coming out, out with that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.980
 substantive situation, it is lighting up our passage or that individual passage.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980
 And many times, of course, people don't recognize that.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.980
 But practice this, this is really the sign, it is similar as a total sign.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:47.980
 Signs, they are the clay-like luminosity expressions that mother is coming, coming and radiating.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.980
 So each time we're connecting that, then we relax and meditate as we've been practicing that.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:05.980
 Those are, so this is the practices and those are the state that we go through.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.980
 And this is then externally, for say, dark.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.980
 But then still there is inner three signs that go through.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
 Those are known as the inner signs.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.980
 According to the dark mind, this inner three signs, when that happens, then you really need to act.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.980
 Then you lost the positions of every element.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:36.980
 Now the chapter is gone, all that is gone, and now there is only two things in a position, in a way

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.980
.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.980
 Those are known as the white element and the red element that we each received from our parents.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 Still they are in their positions.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:57.240
 But as soon as these four or five chapters are lost their functioning systems in the teaching set,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.980
 then soon after,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.980
 those positions are going to those two.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:12.410
 And those are the fours in the teaching set that white element, that which we go through, our

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.980
 father,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.980
 is mainly the prince for that location is in Kaurangchakra.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:27.980
 Kaurangchakra, and now Kaurangchakra is losing and that white is dropping down in the teaching set.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.980
 It coming down as star shooting, star shooting from the door.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 At that moment, they individually, that inner sign, everything is illuminated as white.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 White, and that is, the white element is coming down to the heart center.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:56.980
 And soon after that, then the red element, which is below the narrow center, that position lost,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:04.980
 is coming up as like flashing red light went upward.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:12.980
 In the Thasana Nambasthiti, here he said that time, this is not Thasana Nambasthiti,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.980
 in here he said that time the channels are responding.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:26.980
 So that means white channel, left channel is now stopped.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.980
 And now these two elements coming up and down, and between that,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 our subtle consciousness that has been, we've been talking other day,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.980
 the subtle wind, subtle consciousness, that essence, that nucleus that will be used,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.980
 or I use the word, that trap between these two elements.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.980
 In the Thasana Nambasthiti here, he said that time, that consciousness, all of them,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:04.980
 merged in the center channel, center channel, center channel, that one.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.980
 So that time it is merged with that.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.980
 That time has completely become the blank state.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.980
 In a world, inwardly to that individual's experience,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:23.980
 it's completely, in a way, black out, around black out.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:31.980
 And that will happen. That is according to the teaching here, then we pass.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:39.980
 And that ended here as part of the death and dying period.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.980
 Period is ended there, that and then we die.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:51.980
 This again, this white, red and black out experience is also no other

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.980
 than the again, clear life, luminosity experience.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.980
 It's sure. Those who meditate the practice, such as Dvaraka,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980
 what's our own practice is this.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 This really time, the teaching says, this is enlightened.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.980
 It is the glowing expression of this molecular light, luminosity experience,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.980
 dawning to you. And at that moment, you can reach enlightenment.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.980
 Many times they can reach enlightenment

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.980
 to the ground of higher state or the sound of higher state, right there.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.980
 So that is really my teaching today on the battle of death and dying

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:40.980
 and as well as battle of the meditating, the historical.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.980
 And we talk dominant meditation and then dedicate it.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
 And then tomorrow we can give you some questions and talk that to me.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.980
 Thank you.
