Buddhist meditation is always based on love for all beings, so you should conclude your practice with thoughts of compassion and loving-kindness.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
 Welcome, this is the 12th session of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group from Padmasamy Ling Monastery

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.000
 and Retreat Center in New York.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Today we'll be discussing Chapter 12 of the Venerable Kamparomache's book, "The Buddhist Path,"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 and the chapter is entitled, "Meditating on the True Nature of the Mind."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.650
 So we'll begin with the opening prayers, and then we'll go into the discussion. Thanks so much for

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.000
 joining us.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.060
 The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential, extraordinary

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.000
 view and doctrine of the early translation school,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 you keep alive and spread by the light of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great temple, I pray at your lot

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.000
us' feet.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 In the palace of the oatman Dhamdattu, the essence of all the Buddhists of the three times,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 the one who shows clearly the dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honorable Rukuru,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 glorious root teacher of precious one, dwelling on the lotus' seed and the crown of my head.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Hold me with your great kindness and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech and mind.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Thanks, so we're beginning in chapter 12, it's page 61 in the Buddhist Path.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And so I'll give a really quick summary of this first half or so of the chapter.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So the first paragraph, Khmerubache say that in meditation practice,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 once the body is balanced with good posture and the speech is balanced with natural breathing,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 the next step is to balance the mind by keeping it in its natural state.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 The meditation instructions for this practice are simple.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.440
 Sit with a good posture and maintain your mind in its natural balance without being disturbed by

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.000
 thoughts or experiences.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.530
 In Zochen meditation there is nothing to do aside from relaxing your awareness in its natural

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 clarity.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Experience the nature of your mind as being spacious like the sky.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The third paragraph, Rupache say you can practice this meditation any time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 You already have this nature and don't have to change what you truly are.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Recognize your natural state and this by itself will remove what is unnatural.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Maintaining your awareness in its natural state takes some effort

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 since our habits of not being in this state are so strong.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And then the nature of mind is inexpressible and inconceivable

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 though it can be experienced directly by our own awareness.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Don't follow your thoughts, watch your mind with mindfulness.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Meditate with a relaxed mind but don't be so relaxed that you keep postponing your practice

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 or you fall asleep during your session.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 The mind has to be mindful, clear and gentle.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So then we'll go into the first topic question.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Meditating on the nature of the mind is something you can do anytime.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 You don't have to go somewhere special to acquire the nature of the mind.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 You don't need to buy it from a store or dig it up from the earth, it's always available.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 During meditation you do not need to think of any particular thoughts

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 or make any effort to change what you are.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Just simply maintain where you are and what you are without trying to do anything unusual.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 If you meditate by simply maintaining the natural state then everything unnatural will be removed.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 You do not have to do anything except remain on your cushion.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 In one sense this is something of a joke but in another sense it is true.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 You simply relax on your cushion and that's it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Although meditation does not demand any physical activity

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 you do have to maintain the meditative state and this takes some effort.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Effort is not actually part of the basic ground nature

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 but since our obscurations and ignorance are so strong

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 it requires effort to make meditation natural.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 When meditating in this way it is not necessary to fight with the obscurations.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 As your practice develops power it will spontaneously remove the obscurations

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 since they are not part of the primordial nature.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 This practice will reveal more and more of the basic ground of primordial wisdom.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 The rising sun does not fight with the darkness

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 just as its presence makes darkness disappear.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 In the same way when we meditate

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 the presence of the primordial nature overcomes ignorance.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Page 61, third paragraph, page 62, the first full paragraph.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 One of the things I was wondering about, kind of from a practical experience point of view

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 that sentence, you simply relax on your cushion and that's it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.560
 I was curious like what kind of mistakes or things that kind of came up for y'all when you first

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.000
 heard that

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 because it seems like one of those things where it's so simple it's hard

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 or there's also lots of assumptions you could make about it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 So I was curious what y'all thought.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 I mean in a way it seems like all the instructions are all about

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 the setting up those good conditions that we receive.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Even how this chapter comes after setting up the good conditions with clearing,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 balancing the winds and channels and having good posture, things like that.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Of course in all these teachings and then specifically with meditation

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 you know there's a shamatha, a comma binding, I think we go on to that.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So I think, I mean in a nutshell maybe, all the basic instructions we've received

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 about meditation are exactly inseparable from

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 they're all about just setting up good conditions to relax and undo.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And then also right here in the chapter you know not things, I mean it does take effort

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 but not getting too tight and you know many short sessions and all that.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.400
 I mean that's just what comes to my mind first but I'm sure other people have other thoughts as

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.000
 well.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I think one thing that I may have run into is just forgetting that,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 forgetting what they say and if I remember to not be too tense or be too relaxed

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 then that could probably help with achieving that but if I forget that

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 then I may just end up falling into those things.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Yeah, not be too intense or too relaxed.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 It's really, I mean I think it's profound at all levels of the Buddhist teaching.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Even the Buddha Shakyamiri taught that in the more foundational teachings and it's often quoted

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 and it's so essential because it can apply I think at all levels.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 But all that, I mean so it's about how do we bring balance.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 It's with the metaphor of a string being taught or loose.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 There has to be an effort to make it just right so that it functions as it can.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Like there, definitely like it says here in this quote, we have to apply effort.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 The nature of the mind itself doesn't have to be changed or built or made better

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 but our habit is to not see it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Our habit is to totally be so contrived and tense

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 and all these different dynamic creative ways of getting cocooned in our own little grasping web.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And so all this like being too tight or too loose

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 or bringing out good positive conditions of body and speech and even mind.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 I think this is really meaning we've talked about it quite a bit about creating positive habits.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Creating good healthy uplifting circumstances.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.560
 Really reducing or eliminating the negative disturbing reactive situations internally and

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.000
 externally.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And all that is totally on the relative level.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Like how do we do good and avoid harm and create a situation so that on the absolute level

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 that open, relaxed, always present, unchanging, unstained awareness can be seen.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It's like the sky.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 You don't have to make the sky be open and spacious

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 but in order to see that if your window is dirty you have to clean the window.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Then the sky can be as open and spacious as it wants

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 but if it's a dirty window then it doesn't really matter.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 It won't really help just to hear oh it's spacious.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 So I think it's practical and not just practical but essential

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 bringing the relative and the absolute or the form and formless aspects of ourselves

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 and the teachings together in a natural balance union

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 like their talk that Buddha and all these great masters.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I think a related point is just that at least part of bringing that kind of balance

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 is or at least I think one of the keys is just mindfulness.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.500
 And they talk about that in the chapter that like how can we know whether we're too tired or too

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.000
 loose

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 and that's really mindfulness being and maybe sometimes they say it in different words

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 like conscientiousness or alertness but in general it's that sense of being

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 or they do talk about it as a watcher in this chapter.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So just like that we have to be a little bit aware of what's going on

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 and that's really where we can be not too close watching

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 because then that's too tight but also not too loose

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 and not watching enough getting dull.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So for myself anyway I think mindfulness is part of the key to finding that balance.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Well I find when I get busy even if I sit down it's hard to relax

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and if my life is busy when I'm busy then I can't.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It would be very difficult for me to do this.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So then when that happens like what do you find helpful to like to relax?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Sometimes. It's just that's the way life is you know.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 But going outdoors helps or sometimes taking a walk if I had to talk for a walk.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 I think maybe to like sometimes with shawmata meditation is good I think.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 For me I find it helpful like at the beginning of practice

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 if you're just doing all kinds of activities and I mean it depends on where you're coming from

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 as a practitioner and your level of understanding too I guess

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 but for me personally I find it helpful if I have a lot of activity like mental activity

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.210
 or physical movement then when I sit down then a little bit of shawmata meditation can be really

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.000
 helpful.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And also sometimes reflecting on those like they say at every meditation session

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 those four thoughts that reverse the mind from some side

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 just to kind of just like clear some space and remember why I'm even sitting

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 or practicing formally you know and then even though it's not like something

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.420
 I mean like what they're saying here all you have to do is sit on your cushion and stay there you

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.000
 know

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 but like everybody seems to be saying too like once the conditions come together

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 then they're spontaneously that meditation or awareness seems like it would be there.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 I mean always with a path that's taught a union of accumulating merit and accumulating wisdom

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 and accumulating merit is developing positive you could say developing positive concepts

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 it is like developing conceptual merit and then realizing non-conceptual wisdom

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 like there's literally nothing we can do to make non-conceptual wisdom more non-conceptual

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 it's just it's just it's open you can't make it more open it's infinitely open

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 but then to see that then it's always taught this accumulating merit

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 accumulating conceptual merit generating positive qualities

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 it's always I mean it's just to reiterate all these things we've been going over so many times

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 the earlier chapters talk about refuge and bodhicitta connecting to our motivation

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 bringing all beings to mind seeing samsara and wanting to turn away from it

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 really connecting genuinely with our teacher and with the lineage and cultivating that devotion

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 like all that in a fabricated sense is totally contrived pretending unnatural

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 deluded when it's in the grasping mind but if we're not in pure non-grasping awareness already

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 then we have to grasp we have to bring up devotion and compassion and love and attentiveness

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 and hold an object so we don't run around everywhere like we have to grasp

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.500
 and there's a really big difference we talked about this before but positive grasping and negative

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.000
 grasping

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 positive accumulation of merit versus negative dispersal of all the good things

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 like just totally wasting our time and wasting our life we have to positively build something

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 and there's just no way around it and it seems like the teachings are really clear about that

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 there's no way around what is it you like fake it till you make it

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 contrive until it's natural there's so many teachings really say that

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 so I guess a little how would you relate that back to here that you know when we're talking about

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 you have to you know build these positive qualities and then we're also we have practices like this

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 where it's sit on the cushion that's it I mean of course you know we also have the posture

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 and all these you know supports that we have there but how do we relate those two

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 maybe that's that's part of like the three frames of practice when we have a formal practice

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 session

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 right we have those three frames which are the first one is really setting up those conditions

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 you know and just in a really simple way of framing that there's you know like Andrew mentioned

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 like reflecting on the four thoughts that turn the mind like towards the Dharma

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and towards our practice and ignites our bodhicitta and our inspiration and our aspiration

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 widens our view and softens our heart and opens our minds and you know along with that

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.790
 recalling and bringing into presence feeling the presence of the Buddha you know all the bodhisatt

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.000
vas

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Guru and Pashayi all the lineage masters and really connecting with the Buddha

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Dharma Sanka taking really a reaffirming you know our closeness feeling and our dedication

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 and our joy you know in commitment to like following the path you know to fruition

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 you know and for the benefit of all beings and generating bodhicitta you know all these things

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 they are part of that process of setting up these positive kind of conditions

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and then these other parts you know make have being in a nice space you know

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 as a part of nurturing that balancing our body in our speech you know clearing the winds

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 doing something you know prior that helps us calm our body speech in mind a little

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 so clearing the winds having a good posture you know maybe like Andrew mentioned

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 doing a little with our mind we've also we've contemplated these other things

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 but then we'll be doing a little shamatha or something and then the middle section

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 would then be you know the main practice which in this sense is just relaxing that

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 you know just letting go like we've set up all these beautiful conditions

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and put our concentration towards these like positive qualities and things

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 and but then we're going to just within that relax like follow the instructions that are here

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 and then the third frame is once we've fulfilled that intention of our main practice

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 and dedicating you know that merit for all beings and connecting with our aspirations

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 so like just the way those three frames kind of set that up

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 and of course we could get more and more elaborate and different kinds of practice but that's it

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 and then maybe two maybe it's a good way to segue into the second point

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 which kind of goes over that how that's how to build up a practice too

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 because if maybe we're just beginning and we're trying to like just completely relax

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 into this ocean pure nature for like an hour straight it's kind of not practical

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 so like I mean but just like little by little so even in that main practice

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 maybe we go on to that and we can talk more of something

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 okay yeah so we'll do this yeah do this quick very short summary and then we'll read that

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 so in this second part of this chapter which is say that and go kind of go over this story

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 about how to find a good balance in one's practice being not too tight or too loose

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 but it's like an instrument that is properly tuned without being too tight or loose

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 and then give the example of this monastic who used to be a mandolin player

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 and kind of was having difficulty with the practice either too tense or too relaxed

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 and then Buddha gave him that instruction don't be too tight and don't be too loose

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 and understood and then could apply fine balance more easily

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 then finally Rinpoche say with this proper balance your practice will go very well

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 as a beginner it's best to do short sessions many times

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 and gradually extend the length of the sessions as your practice becomes more stable

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 since Buddhist meditation is always based on love and compassion for all beings

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 always spend some time dedicating the merit at the conclusion of your session

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 which actually greatly multiplies the merit of your practice

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 so then we'll read the second part

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 this is from page 63 the last paragraph

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.540
 when you meditate with the proper balance you can reach enlightenment and discover the primordial

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.000
 nature

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 as a beginner it is best to practice for many short periods

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 and gradually extend the sessions to longer and longer periods of time

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 meditate for as long as you have time and when you finish

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 dedicate the merit for the benefit of all sentient beings

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Buddhist meditation is always based on love for all beings

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 so you should conclude your practice with thoughts of compassion and loving kindness

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 when you dedicate the merit to others it does not mean that you lose that merit

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 actually it multiplies your merit

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 so it is good to always complete your meditation session by spending a few minutes

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 dedicating the merit for the benefit of all sentient beings

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 can I add something to what I was talking about before we went to that

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 but just as far as relating back to that last question too

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 but in that main practice that middle section of our practice session

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 kind of how it relates to this drop by drop little sessions

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 so even if say we have a whole hour to practice

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 we can spend some time in the first part with refuge, bodhicitta etc

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 but then in that main section where we are focusing on just meditating

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 on the nature of mind just connecting with that

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 we can still even within that have little sessions

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 where we say okay I am going to totally relax for a minute or something

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 and then we can then maybe spend another few minutes

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 actually then again connecting with our bodhicitta

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 or reciting a mantra or whatever else

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 as something that is again instead of just getting distracted or sleepy or dull

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 something that helps kind of bring more clarity to and reaffirming what we are doing

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 and re-inspiring and having stabilizing our concentration

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 and then again then we can relax for another

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 I mean that is just another thing I know I find helpful

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 depending on different things just kind of even within that main session

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 we can have these little sessions where we are totally relaxing

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 and then come back with something that helps to kind of re-strengthen that

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 and then relax and then for whatever amount we are kind of committed to do

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 and then dedicate per now

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 and I think I know for myself too something that is helpful too

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 is to really have whenever we are going to have our meditation session definitely day to day

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 that is really good in having that continuum as a regular thing day to day

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 so kind of for like myself setting up a time that I can most likely

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 always do and while it is so nice to practice

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 there is also other aspects to our practice and our life and our activities

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 so just at least for ourselves to know what can we always know we can do

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 and have that joy of something to look forward to

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 and then it doesn't become a big burden if other things come up

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 we can't do our session for a really long time

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 but just know oh every morning I can at least do whatever 15 minute meditation

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 and if we can do more great or whatever

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 I'm just using that number as an example but I find that helpful too

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 so within the session itself we can have those periods of just trying

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 to be mindful, relaxing and then re-strengthen that and relax

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 but then also on our day to day kind of making sure we follow through

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 and give ourselves and with our body to everyone that respect

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 of keeping our practice time and having it be something that we can practically do

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 this seems like kind of a simple thing but I find that easily a challenge

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 I think related to that really pithy point of having short sessions many times

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 that that's really applicable in post meditation practice

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 because it's like for one day, any time I hear a doorbell today I'll look to my mind

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 any time I pet my doggy I'll look at my mind

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 and then next day okay any time I have to turn left when I'm driving I'll look to my mind

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 any time I hear the word hello I look to my mind

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and then keep changing up these little reminders and kind of stay fresh

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 but in the same way it becomes a short meditation session

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 look to the mind just do it for a few seconds

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 and then we get in the habit of just looking to the mind

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 and then a day change then pick another reminder in the morning

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 any time I see the red square or whatever look at a stop sign

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 see someone with a blonde hair like there's all kinds of little things

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 didn't look to the mind look to the mind

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 it becomes like little ways of having short sessions many times

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 which is all about like increasing the stability

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 like the whole big thing with mindfulness is just to remember to imply the instruction

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 what is the instruction am I applying it

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 and this is kind of really tactical in post meditation

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 when we're out and about like we're almost all always doing all the time

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 because it's so busy now but I find that that's helpful

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 and that's really good too because it's also kind of helps break down that separation

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 we might make between practice and life

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 you know really blending that meditation and post meditation kind of

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 yeah for the sake of telemarkers I used to tell myself

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 anytime I hear the phone ring

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 look to the nature of mind so I'm not angry when I pick up the phone

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and it's so I wanted to sell me something

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 makes it easier on them

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 that's a good question

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 I was just wondering this is actually from kind of more the first part of the chapter

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 but on page 61 it's the second paragraph

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 and it's just kind of right in the middle of the paragraph

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 there's this line that says inner awareness is different than external awareness

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 it is called clear light emptiness

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 and I just wasn't sure what the difference was

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 between inner awareness and external awareness

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 or what is primarily what is external awareness

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 because they say what inner awareness is

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 yeah here I think they're really talking it's specific to this paragraph

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 because right before that they say without analyzing one's experiences

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 or being disturbed by thoughts

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 and then they go to make this distinction between inner awareness and external awareness

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 so here I think they're really talking about external awareness

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 like our usual way of grasping at appearances

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 following after experiences

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 pushing away from things

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 leading kind of

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 having a big narrative in our minds

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 and kind of grasping after that narrative

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 or getting upset or whatever

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 so that is being external awareness

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 as opposed to this internal awareness

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 which is what they're talking about in the chapter

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 recognizing how our mind is before it grabs on to anything

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 so that non grasping awareness

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 or it seems like someone like that too

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 is external awareness

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 like in the awareness of any object

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 you know like keeping the mind on any object at all

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 even meditation or anything

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 so that would be external from the sense of

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 there is a subject

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 taking an object

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 or taking an object of perception

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 as the focus

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 instead of

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 I guess

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 so you could say like

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 external awareness is dualistic awareness

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 and internal awareness is non-dualistic?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 could you say it that way?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 it's really specific to how they're talking about it here

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 I think they're talking about it really generally

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 because it doesn't mean any time you're aware of an object

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 you're dualistic

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 because a Buddha's aware of so many objects

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Kambhramiches are aware of so many objects

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 the thing is

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 if you first are aware of your internal awareness

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 or your own nature of mind

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 and while abiding in that nature of mind

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 allow its natural knowing capacity

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 to clearly arise as objects

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 as thoughts, as wisdom awareness

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 then there's not a problem

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 there's not a division there

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 because we're in a state of awareness

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 that doesn't create that sense of a contracted me

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 versus other things

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 so that separation is not there

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 so then it's called wisdom display

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 and that's related to what you brought up before

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 of the awareness

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 so there's a primordial nature

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 this chapter is on the primordial nature

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 the true nature

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 and then there's a different thing about actually

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 being aware of that true nature

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 so the primordial nature itself

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 whether it's the nature of an out

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 of yourself or an object phenomena

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 that's called in Buddhism Darmadattu

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 and then the awareness of that nature

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 which we're trying to recognize

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 and cultivate in this chapter

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 is called Dharmakaya

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 so the awareness of the nature

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 and the nature itself

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 there is this slight distinction there

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 and then the awareness of objects

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 this Darmadattu is more

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 the pure objects

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 but pure objects

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 like the nature of them is pure as Darmadattu

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 and what's aware of that

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 is pure subjectivity, pure awareness

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Dharmakaya

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Areekpa

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Areekpa

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 That's one of the definitions

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 so there's an apparent polarity

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 of subject-object

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 but it's pure subject and pure object

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 as a Buddha experiences their awareness

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 experiencing its arising clarity display

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 so you don't have this

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 samsaric tension there

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Thank you, that's helpful

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 I think another point with this

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 is there's so many polarities here

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 and often in the Zogchen teachings

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 we get into these

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 and it can be confusing

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 it definitely has for me

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 like we have to make effort

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 but the true nature is effortlessly accomplished

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 I mean just all these kind of things

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 about grasping and non-grasping

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 contriving and not contriving

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and a lot of times

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 in the Zogchen teachings

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 they do make this distinction

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 like there's an awareness that doesn't grasp

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 and there's awareness that grasps

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 or there's they say

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 we need to take effort to see our nature

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 but once we see our nature

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 it's called a natural effortlessness

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 the nature itself has a natural energy

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 that continues

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 and so it doesn't require a constrained grasping effort

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 but a natural joyful effort arises

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 because that's the nature of the mind

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 and similarly with Shyamata

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 often times we might think

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 well maybe we do Shyamata first

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 and then once we get beyond that

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 we'll just divide in the nature all the time

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 but that abiding

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 the actual sustaining

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 or abiding in the nature is Shyamata

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 it's called the union of Shyamata and Vipassana

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 or just it's exactly the title of this chapter

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 how do we continually meditate on the nature of mind

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 it's non-dual Shyamata

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 or natural effortless Shyamata

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 but so there's a lot of these polarities

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 and almost all of them you can say

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 grasping fill in the blank

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 or non-grasping fill in the blank

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 grasping effort, non-grasping effort

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 grasping joy, non-grasping joy

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 I mean it's just really

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 and I found that for myself

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 it's clarified some points

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 that were otherwise would be really confusing

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 grasping mind, non-grasping mind

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 I thought another quick point

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 this chapter is meditating on the nature of mind

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 and just to point out that there's a lot of the other chapters

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 like the primordial nature or emptiness

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 or union of emptiness and compassion

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 that these are really talking about the view

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 what is the nature of mind

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 whereas this chapter in particular is talking about

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 how to sustain the recognition of the nature of mind

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 and it's very clear that Buddhist teachings

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 and his kambhramiches is taught

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 the view always comes first

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 we have to see where we're going

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 before we take steps to go there

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 we have to recognize our nature

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 before we can sustain that recognition

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 like that's why study is so important

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 before we meditate

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 or that's why we have to see

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 what is the nature before we can sustain that recognition

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 this tawa, the view is always

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 and so many masters have emphasized that point

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 and so we're kind of jumping into this chapter

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 as if we're just dividing somehow

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 and we haven't really said what we're abiding in

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 but all of these other chapters have really gone over that

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 it's really as to what Liah said earlier

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 about the importance of setting up our practice

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 that in the context of the three frames

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 it's not like all you do is just sit on the cushion and do nothing

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 I mean you really do do a lot of these

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 setting up the view and connecting with the meaning of the practice

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 and establishing the proper conditions

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 and then this chapter

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 we apply the instructions of this chapter

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 or just kind of tying that together

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 and the way that all fits with just the whole three

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 you know, reading, listening to the teachings

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 and then contemplating them, really thinking

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 and then there's this part of meditating

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 like how that relates to the same kind of idea of the view

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 and then the practice that goes with that view

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 as it seems like starting these chapters

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 we just started previously

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 and this section of the book in the next two chapters

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 are definitely more about actually practicing

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 you know, with that view

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 kind of tying into the view

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 there was kind of in the terms that go with the study sheet

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 one of the, under primordial nature, the quote is

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Buddha nature transcends the four extremes

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 of existence, non-existence, both, and neither

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 and I was hoping anyone could kind of elaborate more on that

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 because I think, you know, existence, non-existence

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 has a level of clarity to it

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 but then the both, the neither

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 I thought maybe that'd be useful to go, could be useful

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 though we should also keep in mind our time

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 and getting to the big discussion

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 we should just be on all extremes, any extreme whatsoever

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and all those are based on the notion of entity

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 that something's really there

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 so not having anything substantial

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 has actually existed there

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 aside from the nature

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 aside from that experience of that nature itself

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 where the nature displayed

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 it's the quintessential definition

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 of Mnyamaka middle way teachings

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 beyond these four extremes

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 the Quatrelama, it's the Mnyamaka view

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 which is said to be exactly identical to the Dzogchen view

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 when you apply it in practice

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 that any position you take assumes that you're taking a position

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 and it's omitting other positions

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 so it's partial

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 you're saying it's this way

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 and by definition it's not that way

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 so it's saying, Mnyamaka is saying it's not this way

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 that's a partial, it's not only that way

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 because that's partial, it leaves out this part

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 it's not both because they're mutually exclusive

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 they can't both be there without a contradiction

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 and then the fourth, neither, there's no alternative

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 there's no conceptual alternative that's possible

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 and this is literally logic

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 I mean this is logically talking about all logical possibilities

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Mnyamaka is used to exhaust all logical possibilities or concepts

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 so we can go beyond conceptual grasping mind

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 and recognize non-conceptual wisdom

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 so it's technically saying, of all logical possibilities

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 you investigate each of those four positions

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 this, not this, both, neither

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 and you can see that each produces an internal contradiction

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 so logically it's not a feasible position at all

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 and you're only left to have to directly realize

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 what it is that's frustrated

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 because there's no position to it that works

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 because they all break apart when you look at them closely enough

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 and which is what Mnyamaka does so well

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 so look at how any conceptual position

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 includes a logical and inherent logical contradiction

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 so you have to go beyond a conceptual position

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 to realize a non-conceptual awareness

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 I thought the one thing I just thought to mention

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 that I think is really important on this point too

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 is the vision between meditation and not meditation

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 is that we often spend a lot of time reading

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 to reading and looking at computers

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 and doing a lot of heavy conceptual work

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 so it's nice too to apply these instructions

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 like when we're studying Mnyamaka or the teachings

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 or looking at the computer

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 just like when our mind gets tired

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 which it does from doing all that stuff all the time

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 and just like we're reading or studying

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 then just taking a step back and trying to do that

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 you know, recognize the nature within that

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 and just let it go, just relax

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 for just short periods like throughout the day

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 and I think that, I don't know, I just wanted to say that

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 because I know we spend so much time

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 doing all this heavy duty conceptual work

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 and Rinpoche's often say don't let it hover in the brain

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 it has to sink in the heart

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 and just pausing and just really connecting to the meaning

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 is exactly that process

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 that's a profound 5th instruction with studying

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 and integrating our lives into the practice

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 and I just wanted to say real quickly

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 that final point about dedicating the merit

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 which is almost an additional point to this chapter

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 they said that's one of the extraordinary teachings of the Buddha

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 that in the end we reaffirm our bodhicitta motivation

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 and totally give away any of the merit or benefit

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 that comes about from our practice

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 and often times there's the idea and worldly view

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 when you work so hard to gather this thing

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 then it's kind of foolish to just give it away

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 because you're left with nothing

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 but in this view connecting to like this true nature

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 it only glorifies the true nature

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 and it only opens our abilities and our wisdom

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 and our loving heart more and more

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 the more we're constantly work

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 just put all this work and energy into getting this good thing

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 and just totally give it away

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 and it just multiplies

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 it's a beautiful extraordinary teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 and give it away to all beings

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 and it becomes greater

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 it's the profound beauty of transcendental generosity

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 recognizing the nature and giving away aspiring

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 it's like this seamless interdependence

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 of this seamless union of the absolute and the relative

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 it's beautiful in that statement

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 I didn't understand the logic of why it multiplies

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 because it's no longer within a fixed frame of reference

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 we draw all the frame of reference

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 and once we draw all frame of reference where are we?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 we're everything

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 it's everything, limitless

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 we totally just sink into open infinite primordial awareness

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 and from there what's its expression?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 its natural expression is infinite all inclusive love and compassion

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 that sensitively engages with and responds to and affirms other beings

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 all arising phenomena

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 so that's how it becomes infinite

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I mean not just multiplying, it becomes infinite

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 we're no longer one person with one little bag of Santa Claus goodies

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 it's infinite, maybe Santa Claus has some abilities too

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 but we're not in any singular position

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 but we're not in any singular position

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 we're not in any singular position

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 by this merit may all obtain omniscience

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 may it defeat the enemy wrongdoing

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 from the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness and death

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 from the ocean of samsara may I free all beings

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 the precious bodhicitta and those without it may it be generated

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 and those who have it may it never diminish

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 but always continue increasing
