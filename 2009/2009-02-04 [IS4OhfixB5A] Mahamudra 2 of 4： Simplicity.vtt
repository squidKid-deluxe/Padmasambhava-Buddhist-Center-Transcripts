00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 And as well as upper truth, least two truths. There is nothing besides these two truths.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And the sixth sense is the subject. All are relative, that means every simple way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.990
 All is of this all appearance, of seeing, hearing, and thinking. The object and subject of all is

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.000
 relative.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:08.980
 And the absolute truth is the nature of the seeing, hearing, and thinking, or subject of the object

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.000
.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Nature, which is, then, under-conformant, or the indeed. That is a relative absolute truth, sorry.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Well, third-party device, and therefore, often known as absolute truth is, is beyond the conception

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.000
.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 The duality mind cannot comprehend the absolute truth, and that way duality is related to truth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Behind the duality is absolute truth.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Behind this relative truth and absolute truth are not separate from each other.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.420
 Both are existing in same state. And this, again, relative truth is in the way called kundu, kundu

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.000
 means artificial.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.640
 Kundu means illusion truth, okay? Illusion truth. Truth is everything what we see. We see there's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 very non-substantive, solid, existing essence there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Therefore, it's called illusion. It is all illusion.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And what, why is this illusion true? Then we can understand it. That's absolute truth.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.630
 And that is, again, through the impersonation, analyzation of this relative truth, and way, what is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.000
 this, this?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.860
 And kind of analyzing, analyzing, getting of the relative truth, and then trying to find the right

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.000
 of truth.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And that is, again, I think from the next scientist or the physics they did, and let's get an ally.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.730
 It is everything, kind of, from the gross level to the mallet food, to the atom, or to the mallet

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.000
 food, and to everything from there, again, the growth group.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.160
 Everything you go to tells you that this is all very, very, very artificial. And everybody maybe

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.000
 starts saying now, I mean, you know more than us,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.840
 but they start saying every kind of comes from the black banks, or big banks, or something they say

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
, it's coming from big banks.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 That, that, so it all comes from the big banks. Where is that big banks? Or that big banks?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.620
 Big banks. And nobody can tell you that. This can't tell if it's in the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.000
 God, if it's not as absolute.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.230
 God, if it's not in the universe, if it's not in the universe, if it's not in the universe, if it's

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.000
 not in the universe, if it's not in the universe, if it's not in the universe.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And so therefore, again, from the absolute truth, you discover in the...

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.690
 So, from the relative, and here where mass government is, from the relative, discover the absolute

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.000
 truth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 From the absolute truth, discover the relative.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And now, from that nature, from the absolute truth, you see how these relative are arising.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.230
 Arising, when you look from the absolute point of view, to the relative truth of all, then you will

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.000
 see this relative truth, this illusion truth.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It is illusion. Because there's not any substantial themselves.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.010
 And again, as we have used that terminology, from the big banks, from big banks, it can't tell you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.000
 that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 From looking from the big bank, to this world, it is this illusion.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 It is illusion. That's what that means.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:34.600
 Then, you can look at the illusion, you can look at the illusion, you can look at the illusion, you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.000
 can look at the illusion.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Or in other words, from the zero, zero will look to the numbers.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Numbers, or the zero. Then you will see this is illusion.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 From the zero option, or zero level, looking to the world.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Everything comes from the zero. Zero, but zero with zero.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Zero, then, how always how? How you can say?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Therefore, this is called illusion in a relative truth.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.080
 Therefore, this true truth, generally, without this illusion, or without this zero of the big bank,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.000
 there's no illusion there.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And without this illusion, we cannot even see what the other illusion is.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Therefore, they are inseparable.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Can you tell me a little bit more?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:38.990
 Therefore, when you look carefully at this collection and the system of this, it's beyond

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.000
 consumption, beyond energy.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I cannot really tell. It's an inexpressible state, it is inexpressible.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 This inexpressible state is natural. There's nothing further to go than this.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 That cannot go. That is natural.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And that is known as then the free from all complexities.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And with that realization, then, with this realization, and the reciting continuity,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 matter of the power of Kishora, which is our own system,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 they're also similar to our humanity.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And so now, that is again, in the depth we went to Mahamudra's terminologies,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 the one-pointed, and then free from the complex cities.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 That is free from the complex city practice of the Mahamudra and the one people.
