00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 And the Dharma level, we have this place, is an excellent qualification of the prayer,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 the Phukukri retreat in the teaching. I think whenever you know that, really, this is so

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:24.160
 part of the hermitage place. And what in the teaching says the great master, master of materials

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.680
 in Sotr Alankara teaching, says the practitioner, smart one, where you should place, choose the

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 place,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.800
 where you're going to place, place. The place that should have qualification or the easy to get

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 your necessary things, the necessary things, the food, the clothes, the water, those easy.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 And Pima Samhainen says, all is ready, ready then. And then, next one is what, says perfect places.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 What that means in the teaching is what perfect place means, there's not many kind of like,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 violence going on, not going in the violence. During the daytime and the night time, there's

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.760
 nothing also kind of like the violence or something, the animal, wild animals, the beast,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 and all that. It's not a problem. So that is really called perfect place. And then place where,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 next one is perfect location place. That is perfect place where you cannot get sick. Some areas,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.680
 even though it looks like nice, but sometimes the kind of area give you health troubles.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.480
 This place is not really perfect. And then third one, one is, is then, or third or fourth one,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.120
 is then place where you have the many Sangha members, friends, that who has similar conduct,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.800
 similar view, similar area of practicing. So there is always help, help and support.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.600
 Those are the really characteristics of the hermitage said by Buddha Chaturmani. And that's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.280
 summarized by the great master, Maitire. So the Pima Samhale has that really, those all called

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.640
 attests. And so I really like to encourage it. I think it's really good. As Lama Rakhwa said,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.520
 the truth, when we see some people doing retreat, they come here. This is, there's more people

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.840
 coming,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.680
 but it's kind of nice. It's nice. They're using that, particularly those who are now kind of like

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 retired, the baby boomers, we all in the way retired. So maybe they really use the time,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.360
 kind of like a short time, even just for one month or two months or three weeks, they do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.600
 really retreat. It's good. We've been talking that long time and now it's a really good time to be,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.360
 be kind of quiet and peaceful and confident in a progress or inner strength. I think it's just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.680
 wonderful. I like to encourage that. Also the land formation. Yeah, land formation is also really

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.970
 good. In Pima you say, always this has a land. It really has beautiful formation, beautiful

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.360
 formation,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 those explaining, according astrologically explaining that this has all those beautiful,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.800
 kind of call it is the east, east and south and west, the north, all these and then middle of this

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.960
 is like, kind of like lotus blooming land. Those are astrology. What's it called? Pong Chai. Pong

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.480
 Chai.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.280
 Pong Chai, really in the big level, Pong Chai explaining Pong Chai, explaining this is it. So

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.960
 this Pima Samhain is in the middle of the, kind of that lotus blooming land. Also sometimes the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.320
 teacher says the place there looks like very kind of majestic settlement and place there looks that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:10.080
 kind of like, almost like Buddha meditating, Buddha meditating right on the the lap of the Buddha

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:19.200
 for life in this form of the Buddha. If you practice very daily, it has very good energy,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.920
 it will stabilize that and this land has really like that a little bit because this dome is all

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.840
 slough and this where we have stupa side is the lap and this where the Pima Samhain the temple

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.960
 is like this one and the top up this then Buddha's kind of in a way upper part of the body which is

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.720
 still kind of like maybe about 800 feet to go up or maybe something. The ultra weight is 2000 feet

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.720
 I think up top there so maybe 800 or 500 feet to go up. So this is really in the meditation state

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.160
 this kind of formation is really very good and then all this the lush vegetations and formation

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:10.800
 the mountain all that really you said that and it's quite good quite good so all those that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.080
 but Buddha the great methodist thought that it this is really has all those we call it and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.640
 that is also blessed by now so many great masters one after another really came

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.080
 and the great master Sajjak's general his only general really a carnationist and his wife and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.080
 the better which is his own is better and the star of the temple room and of course they now all

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.880
 and ten more far enough many great master new masters and they came and the god new master's truth

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.040
 really came here came here and blessed that so this is really quite good and thank you everyone

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040
 Thank you.
