00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 Definitely in the periphery. For example, in this festival wrap-up, this Sathya Chaturva Uparana is

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.000
 one of the very powerful, powerful to cleanse this karma and this negativity.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.790
 And that's why other day maybe I mentioned that in the teaching story begins with these two

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:32.740
 teachers and students, and they have created such heavy karma, and then that's why this Vaidya Sath

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.000
va gives the teaching of this Sathya Chaturva Uparana.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 And that so easily cleanses, but however, consequence will go for a while. But it definitely cleans

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.000
es. And Vaidya Sathva is the most powerful practice to cleanse and purify the samaya.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 But along with that, there is Dzogchi meditation. Dzogchi meditation is. And then all, every

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.760
 marriage generally is really powerful. So I'm thinking of the samaya, and as well as all the samaya

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.490
 generally, what that means, when samaya is not a single isolated activity, samaya practice, samaya

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.000
 has related with some, not samadri, related with some of the poses.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.790
 Whether it is related with ignorance or calling ignorance best. But then ignorance, activity, merge

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.000
, comes powerfully with the attachment or anger or jealous or arrogance.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.450
 And then we practice. Samaya is not just, samaya is something different than the those. So it is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 really related with the five poses.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 Activity is strongly, and that's why that is that medhala begin to damage or tear or stain. All

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 that means it depends on what the trick is that.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And so medhala, what is medhala? Medhala is again, with no hidden thing, because medhala is love.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Medhala is occupation. Medhala is western.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.180
 Medhala is new, that purity of the three Vedyas. Vedyara speech, Vedyama, Vedyara poems, that is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.000
 what really the medhalas.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.600
 So this samaya is opposite of that. This is samsara, samsara, complete opposite of that. And that's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000
 what the samaya in the Vedyana teachings say.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.030
 It's very delicate. It's very delicate. It's very delicate because it really stains. It's not just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.000
 only that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.400
 But then in the teachings it will affect all things. Even you use it, I'm sure you read the books

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.000
 that the teachings say.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.010
 It's one beautiful bowl, like bowl of the merk. If you drop one drop of blood, the whole, the merk

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.000
 can be spoiled, that teaching says.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.150
 And that's how they use the example of the samaya in that way too. But it depends according to the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.000
 teachings of that.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.390
 And then with bread, with jandek, with bread, all these things, that's what, those are reminded of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.000
 us.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.140
 And we see this in anything that is cleansing purify because this is the time to back up that, to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.000
 clean.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.950
 So that purify. And even in Indonesia, for example, this dhamma, dhamma, dhamma, and this princess,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.000
 all that is stolen.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 So this is our picket or mukbarana, and then this practice. You are definitely in chaos.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Okay, we stop here.
