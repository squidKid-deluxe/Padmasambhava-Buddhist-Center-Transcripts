00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Some of the brothers. Then came what? Supantels a complicated treasury of the Dzongchen.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.530
 Dzongchen. Then that is a sharp radial of the awareness tantra. So that is the value of what the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 teaching came.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:32.480
 Now we talk about this again. As I said, this title, not just only this, in the Buddha teaching,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.560
 always in the teachings, say that title really captures or explains the essence of the teachings,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.840
 conjures the meaning of the entire teaching. So this book or this teaching,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 "Sherik Dorje Nompo" in Tibetan and English, I think "Sharp radial awareness" is this title.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.320
 That is what sharp radial awareness is now. And the fourth one is, if I talk this way,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.160
 of course you can look to the other commentaries too. But I have to explain this way.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.960
 Fourth group is, first group that means the primordial experience of Samyant Badala is essence

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.840
 of the tokyo teachings, cutting thorny tokyo teachings. And the second group,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.440
 the subcontinent and complicated treasure is togyo teachings, togyo teaching explaining.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 So that means this book is explaining of the tokyo practices and togyo practices, togyo practices.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.880
 And so the fourth is the tokyo. Tokyo is by this of course, this is also teaching, this tokyo and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.920
 toga are the essence teachings of the magadhi, big instructions. As I mentioned yesterday,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.200
 and I'm sure you heard that from other great masters, is essence, essence of teachings of the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:32.200
 magadhi. And this tokyo is about cutting tornals or cutting instantly, everything.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:43.720
 Told means everything. So that means what? Cutting instantly, thoroughly all the dualities,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:55.880
 instantly. Not cultivating the time or sometimes, no? They're instantly cutting the dualities.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.120
 Duality is what? Grasping and clinging to the subject and object.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.120
 And as well as ignorance. And then it will be a little bit divided, a little bit more larger,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 detailed than grasping such as salt and others. Grasping to our poems, our speech, our voice,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.600
 our mind, the way we think, all that. We grasp it, we cling. Those are graspings. Then with that,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.480
 we've fabricated more graspings, those tools. Those are known as the emotions. All the emotions,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:57.480
 they are grasping, they are clinging, they are holding. Holding. So those are the grasping,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.400
 the instantly cutting part of that. So that means tsukyu technique. When we apply

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 that tsukyu tea practices, that instantly cutting all the conceptions, all the thoughts,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.600
 and all the trace of that code are completely cut. Cut that without cutting and cut.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:34.760
 Instantly cutting. Cut it. That is what is called tsukyu, the main word, tsukyu. Instantly cutting.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.520
 And what that cut is, very cut. It's cut to the pure state, kada here. In its very word, kada.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:55.240
 Pre-modial pure. Pre-modial pure stated cut. So that pure stated cut does all the duality

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:05.320
 fabrications, unnecessary things. All that which bother us so many lifetime, now instantly cut

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:15.640
 that in the purity, pre-modial status. Few, the pre-modial pure expenses. That we really cut it.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:25.360
 And what that is, that is named as samanabhadari in the doki teacher. Samanabhadari. Samanabhadari

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.640
 is

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:35.160
 samanabhadara and samanabhadari, true. And those are generally ordinary Buddha. What is really

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.080
 did actually, according to teaching, is the same. There's no really big difference. And when you

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.320
 say

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.560
 samanabhadara and samanabhadari, samanabhadari is slightly different is. Samanabhadari is barely,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:56.200
 it can be literally emphasized on the display of the energy or the clarity aspect of nature.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:03.880
 When you say samanabhadari is slightly emphasizing on the emptiness, openness of the nature,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.880
 reality, both are in, both are same state. And that's why both also in union state, we made

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.400
 illustrations. They are union states. This union indicating the emptiness and appearance or

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.960
 emptiness

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.560
 and the clarity is are in union states. Also this samanabhadara or this pure, pure from the

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.960
 beginning

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.560
 over the thousand here, uh, pre-modulative expenses. It's another name is also pandyaparamata.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.280
 Or samanabhadari is another name is a pandyaparamata. How is that pandyaparamata?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.480
 Again, on illustration level, I'm sure you saw those, uh, mother pandyaparamata. But

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.720
 absolute mother pandyaparamata, which is known as mother of the old four children,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.840
 mother of the old four children, great mother, which is mother of the four groups of children.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.640
 What are those four children? Children of the ahadas, children of the fighting buddhas,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:18.840
 children of the bodhisattvas and children of the buddhas. All these children's born

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:30.600
 because of the mother pandyaparamata. Therefore, it's metaphor. It's mother. Because with all this,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:42.120
 there is no ahada, there is no particular buddha, no bodhisattva and no buddhas. Because of this,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.320
 you, then you must, we can, each of us, we can born, take the bird in our potential,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:59.240
 in our state. Therefore, this is known as great mother. How that great mother is,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.240
 that is, we joined in the heart of the beginning. It's called praise by the

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:13.000
 rahula to the mother from the parliament. Great rahula says. And some say it is the rahula of the

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.720
 buddha's son. And some say it is the famous master, known as rahula, which is also another name,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:30.360
 many masters say, is Sara, saying, he prays, what's it, unborn, unceasing, natural in the sky.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:43.800
 Inexpressible, not yummy, inexpressible, not yummy. Inexpressible and the pandyaparamata,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:55.480
 unborn, unceasing, natural, like the sky or sky, sky, sky only discovered by the discrimination

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:03.560
 earnest cognitions. I'm roughly translated, you know better than me. That is the mother.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:12.040
 This is the mother summon the buddha. That is, when we abide in that, that is also looking to

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.440
 true, to true teaching. And for this, according to the teaching, according to the teaching of the

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.600
 great masters, such as, I mean, all the masters, also very highlighted by the great master,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.080
 Master Manjushri Mahamrammaji, in his teaching said what?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:44.120
 In India, Ajayya Chandrkarthi, Chandrkarthi, in Tibet, great master Rongzom Pa, both

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:58.040
 established, perfect philosophy of the great emptiness view from the beginning.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:07.480
 So, according to the teaching, the true aspect of the teaching, of this emptiness aspect of

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.120
 teaching,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.560
 in the Mademaka Upadhyaparamata, the teaching is the same. There is no difference. In that level,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:22.040
 all the Mademaka Upadhyaparamata, and as well as the Mahamudra, and as well as two practices,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.880
 all the Shivji practices, and sajyabha school, great sajyabha school, the Lambri practice,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.640
 those all in line are the same thing, according to the teaching, according to the great masters.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.440
 Even though there's a lot of different techniques and skills and methods to approach that, but

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.280
 the reality is the goal is the same, according to the teaching. So, this is what this nature is.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:54.360
 This is some of the body, some of the body is still. So, that is kadak trikyu, still an

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:01.790
 unborn, unselfish, all that. Really, this is what. So, this is the essence of the trikyu teaching

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.440
 that,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:10.520
 explaining this. And then, next one is londok zoka kimidu in a debate, and then it's got

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:25.720
 sub-continuous, ekamplicate, ekamplicate, and trejung, trejung of zokchins. That is, this

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:34.280
 sub-continuous, ekamplicate trejung is the toggle practices, essence, condensed meaning of the

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.880
 toggle practices. Why that means? What that means? Because this emptiness, what we're discussing,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:52.200
 the true, the pure from the beginning, this primordial pure expenses, is not hallowed,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.040
 is not blamed, is not negation status,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.840
 that we heard so many times, and I'm repeating that again in 32. It's not negation, it's really

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:17.000
 a golden teaching. Teaching, and every teaching is not negation, it's openness, it's a pervasive,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.720
 infinite, and it's just pervasive. That pervasive, infinite, infinite,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:35.640
 completely pervasive, equally the qualities and the clarity of the richness,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:44.600
 sense is so pervasive, there's no end, no center, it's beyond that.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.840
 What the great, in the teachings, the great master Nagarjana said,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.960
 with the doing, they don't have any boundary, how you can say this is a center, there's no center,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:08.760
 center. That's a pervasive. That pervasive, that infinite, that vastness is completely,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:24.040
 completely pervaded by the qualities or clarity. What that can call it, clarity, is those are

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:34.280
 known as quality of the enlightenment, quality of Buddha. So that means pure from beginning,

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:43.240
 the pervasive beauty state is already enlightened, and Buddha is right with us,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.280
 with us, for that reason, you know.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:58.200
 He said, every living beings are Buddha, but they don't see,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:07.320
 because due to the mishandled of the duality, carbon, otherwise the Buddha.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:17.400
 So this nature, our own nature of the mind, is pervasive, infinite.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.480
 Therefore, when we look to our mind, do we find any center of the mind?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:35.640
 Do we find any edge of the mind? Anything, no. That's called inner space, sometimes in teaching

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:45.560
 name. It's really, it's totally the vastness state. But that vastness is completely pervaded

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:57.000
 with the qualities or the richness. What that richness, those are in the Buddha teaching,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.640
 he said, all the qualities of the enlightenment, chaos in the wisdom,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:11.640
 chaos in the wisdom, and all the death, the inconceivable richness of the enlightenment.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:18.280
 Those are many times in the meditation or in the teaching name, luxurious of the Sambokayas.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:29.560
 So it's luxurious, no power it is, no short it is, no something is missing, it's pervasive.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.640
 And how that came, how that richness came,
