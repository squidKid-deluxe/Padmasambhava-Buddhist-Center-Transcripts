00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
 I'm going to talk briefly about the Dzogchen. Generally, we all, you all practice the Dzogchen

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.080
 and so on. You already know why the Dzogchen teaching intellectually. I'm not saying that

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.720
 we all got realization. We all have some degree of understanding and the knowledge of the

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.760
 intellectually level of Dzogchen teaching. So again, I talk a little bit today on that

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 level. And then the most important ones we understand of the Dzogchen teaching, what

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.080
 we can do is all what I teach and need to practice. Practicing and to bring the result

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.320
 on that. That is really the most important. Knowing is so important, of course, but then

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.360
 the practice is so important. Now, it's here. Here in the highlight of the teachings of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.720
 this he said, and explaining of the Dzogchen's own unmistakably explaining of the Dzogchen

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.560
 part. That's not really teaching. He said, what is that here? See, if I read these translated

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.280
 ones, that the experience of the repertoire, the actualization of the insight and the primordial

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 existence is the Buddha-summoned bhadra, free from abundantly and attainment. And it is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.640
 the great completion of the essential nature of all parts of the samsara and nirvana. Therefore,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.360
 it is known as the path-grade completions. So those are mentioned back here. So now it's

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.240
 said at expense of the Rupa, at the beginning, at the expense of the Rupa, the actualization

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.680
 in sight, primordial existence. So that is how now we're going to actualize this. How

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.440
 do we just go? Generally, again, as I mentioned yesterday, or the day before yesterday, we've

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.320
 been talking about the dzogchen, the nine yanas. We went one after another, another different

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.520
 level of the yanas. So if we talk that same way, if I talk that same way, first is what

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.920
 is the nature of the dzogchen? What is the nature of the dzogchen? The nature of the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:31.080
 dzogchen is primordial in the western, origin in the inherited, on its own, within our own

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.160
 self. All primordial westerns of the clay-like luminosity, which is residing within every

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.920
 single living being in their heart center or in their nature. That is the nature of the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.040
 dzogchen, the primordial western. And what is the dzogchen teaching? That dzogchen teaching

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.640
 is the instruction, how to discover that in the primordial clay-like luminosity in nature,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:17.080
 without effort, without effort and activity, discover that nature. That is dzogchen teaching.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.800
 So now I really explain dzogchen, the nature of dzogchen and the teachings of dzogchen.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.040
 The teaching is that to discover our innate nature, nature of the primordial wisdom, clay-like

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.040
 luminosity, to discover that. That we all have. That has different names and different yanas.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:49.800
 And as we were in the other day, everyone tried to find that truth, and it has all the different

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 interpretations at that, and also different names within the buddhist. But reality,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.240
 nature is one, there's not many natures. Same nature. Same nature. The nature, what this

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:14.600
 nature is, is clay, unappended luminosity, nature. How to discover that? And again,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.760
 all the different schools, the yanas, explain in so many different ways.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.320
 And all those teachings and instructions are so powerful, so spacious. But however, according

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.640
 point with dzogchen, when you look at it, it's all mentally created. Mind. So that means all is

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.920
 effort. All is activity. It is activity of the subject and object in the actions. Activities

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 is all publications. The publication, according to Dzogki teaching, publication activity will not

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 discover the un-publicated nature of the truth, will not discover. Nature is un-publicated,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:14.840
 ordinary, primordial, versatile, uncompounded, enlightened, clay-like luminosity. To discover

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.520
 that nature, exactly as it is, you have to do similar, similar way, as is natural. For that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 reason, Dzogki technique, teaching tells beyond effort any activities naturally discover. And so

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:46.440
 that is really about nature and meaning of the Dzogki teachings. Then in Dzogki teaching has

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.240
 different names. Dzogki has a different name. Dzogki is a Tibetan word. In Sanskrit, according

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.400
 to many great masters, what is it called? Maha-sindhi. That means Maha is a great, great, and

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.120
 the Sandhi means completion. And Dzogki has another different name and called Ati-yoga.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:18.920
 And Ati means ultimate. Yoga means the same as natural. So ultimate yoga. That means all yoga we

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.400
 translate. I mean yoga meaning, of course it's very popular in English too. Yoga means yoga. What

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:35.000
 means yoga? It's natural. Yoga means natural. So ultimate nature. That means, that indicates

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.600
 there's nothing higher, better, deeper, more accurate, more correct natural than discover our

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:58.360
 innate nature of the mind. That means Ati-yoga. Ati, supreme ultimate yoga. That is yoga. Yoga.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.600
 Now this great teaching, when Buddha gave that teacher, of course you've heard so many times

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.720
 and I also said many times, I heard that too. But again, everyone says that. Buddha gave this

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.880
 teaching. The greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, gave this teaching in the form of the Buddha

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.080
 summoned the Buddha. Buddha summoned, therefore in the teaching said, there is nothing higher

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:32.040
 and a better teacher than the summoned the Buddha. Buddha's teacher is a summoned the Buddha. Where

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.080
 he gave the teaching, this Buddha gave the teaching, in the pure land of Akanisha,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:49.640
 pure land that beyond the dualities, grasping, beyond, not just the pure, beyond the dualities,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:59.240
 that pure land, pure land. To whom that self-discipline, the wisdom emanation,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.920
 such as the five dhyana Buddha, Vaiya sattva, Vaiya dharas, Buddha gave that teaching.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.360
 There are no other than the Buddha summoned the Buddha. Same realization, same status, same

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:18.040
 display, self-discipline, primordial wisdom. That was the teaching measure, self-discipline.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:27.320
 How he gave that teaching without the world, without the levels. Unborn primordial wisdom

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.400
 status expanded the whole entirely teaching through the rational of the primordial,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:43.960
 those in self-imminated wisdom, complete as an unborn voice. That Buddha gave that teaching.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:52.920
 And who gathered all that teaching? Who recorded that teaching? Again, in the Dandara teaching

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.320
 measure,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:04.760
 and I am, in the teaching section, the Dandara teaching, I am the teacher, I am the

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:13.320
 who collected the teachings, or who gathered the teachings, who gathered the teachings.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:25.560
 The one who gathered all the vatas, either gathering, gathering or who connected. Who gathered

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:25.800
 these

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:35.480
 teachings? Vaiya dharas and Vaiya sattva gathered, all collectible. So all teachings are completely

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:45.880
 pervasive and evaporating, pervasive nature in a Darmadatta state of pure land. And then when time

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.640
 comes, according to the teaching, everyone may be 28 years after the Buddha's Mahafari nirvana,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:59.240
 then when the time is ready to come to this wall, and the great master, Garabdhodi, who is the

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:09.320
 emanation of the Buddha Vaiya sattva, over a high light in light beams, who emanated specifically

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:20.520
 to bring, and to bring the Dokti teachings, came in the Odhianas, that is about 28 years after the

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:27.240
 Buddha's Mahafari nirvana. And then he gathered the entire Dokti teachings, asked who gave them,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.640
 various sattva. In the teachings, there is a difference in his story, that one time,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.440
 to me, from these lungs, many larger stories, I'm sure many of you already know, and I'm not going

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:38.600
 to

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:45.080
 talk about those things, but one time he was young, and about seven years old, he disappeared for

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.080
 quite

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:51.640
 a while, and then, and they all worried, concerned, and when he come, then he reappeared. When he

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.360
 reappeared, he said that whatever the Buddha Vaiya sattva knows, I know everything, I know,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.800
 Vaidya Vaiya sattva. So Vaiya sattva gives every teaching to him, empowerment, transmission,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:12.920
 and instructions, entirely Dokti teachings, handed to the Garabdhodis. And the Garabdhodi

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.480
 becomes the sole lineage holder of the Dokti teachings, the entire teachings in that time,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.920
 human works. And then Dokti teachings, according to the teachings, three times,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.880
 under third generation, Dokti teachings become the single lineage. Garabdhodi is transmitted,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:40.760
 menjushiri matara, menjushiri matara. Matara is immediate to the, actually, those are three

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.520
 lineages, and the teachings say that, and they had, they had many students, but Dokti teachings

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:54.280
 only transmitted to them, to the three, three single lineages, one after another. And then,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:02.360
 Garabdhodi all gathered 6400 total Dokti teachings, and the teachings say that,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:09.160
 he collected that Dokti teachings. And then, menjushiri matara, his foremost student,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:15.960
 divided that Dokti teachings into three sections, mind section, space section, and

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:24.120
 pit and stroke sections. And that is Dokti teachings, he collected that way. And then, here is that

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.120
,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:32.760
 this mind section, mind section of the Dokti teachings, space section of the Dokti teachings,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.910
 pit and stroke sections of the Dokti teachings, that pit and stroke sections of the Dokti teachings

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920
,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.960
 Garabdhodi, sorry, here is divided into four different, those are, I mean,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:57.560
 renowned, outward, inner, sacred, demost, and sacred. And this demost, sacred, also he divided into

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:10.920
 four groups, outer,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:19.320
 no, no, I'm sorry, that he divided that third one, the pit and stroke section, divided into three,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:27.000
 four, and outer, inner, and sacred, demost, and sacred ones. And so now, this, our practice,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.880
 what we practice, this Dokti teachings, is the demost, the sacred ones. That means the demostly

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:41.720
 accurate with the ultimate teachings of the Buddha, that as ordinal, ultimate teaching,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:49.400
 that is sacred. That teaching has two, two stages to practice. Those are the, you all know,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:56.680
 no, true teaching and a pogol teaching, true, divided, true teaching. Both are

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:03.960
 teaching on the nature of the mind, one's own nature of the mind teachings. So that is what

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.680
 really how that, and that teaching came to be, then in a century, by Kinta from this time,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:17.240
 in Gaurabhai Masambhava, great pastor, Bhavana Madara, bought these at the most essence

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.960
 teachings of the, of the Dokti teachings. At the same time, great author, Verojana,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:30.520
 also went into India and received the teachings from, directly from Kirishanath, as well as from

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.400
 Gaurabdhoji. What's the body of the Gaurabdhoji? In Kirishanath, he received the teachings,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.240
 and bought back those out of the same mind section of teaching. With that section of

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.720
 second teaching, he bought back and spread it out in teaching. And there's also Dantara

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:55.640
 board, toggen with that, those are called, even different mind section of the same teachings,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:02.200
 as well as the Longdhi, Longdhi teaching. There's three groups of the Longdhi teaching,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:09.400
 which is known as the, the white groups of Longdhi teaching, black groups of the Longdhi teaching,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.680
 and the striped groups of the Longdhi teaching. Those are the teaching branches of three different

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.760
 sections of the Dokti teachings that he bought. But the pre-instruction section of teaching is only

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.600
 taught by the great Mahatma Ramana Madhara and Gaurabha Ramasambhava, to select the groups.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:34.040
 That teaching becomes, I mean, that, this all teachings are now existing, and why do you practice

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.320
 it? But regularly, this beat starts with second teaching, than Gaurabha Ramasambhava, and the

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.640
 Ramana Madhara teaching is that, kind of, more than, I'm generally your whole Dokti teaching,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.240
 is really completely kind of glorified, more clarified by the great Mahatma Ramasambhava.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.360
 Ramasambhava, who came in the 13th century, around the 13th century time, and bought,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:03.080
 and he was the, I mean, known as one of the great Dokhi masters. All the time, even many,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:11.160
 history, many great masters, mentioned Gaurabha Dodi of Tibet. Gaurabha Dodi of India is in India,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.560
 but Nampi Ma is Gaurabha Dodi of Tibet, that he really bought, he put some, all Dokhi teachings,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.080
 kind of, completely clarified, but regularly, the two lineage of the Nintek lineage, even though it

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.160
's

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.120
 the same, the two lineage that comes from Gaurabha Masambhava and from Mahatma Madhara,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.960
 he put together those so-called seven whole groups of the Nintek teachings, and all that,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.040
 he meant the commentary, all that, so that is how they're really about that. So, what all this now

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:48.040
 teaching, this entire Dokhi teaching, by Kunkimpa and to Gaurabha Masambhava teachings,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.880
 teachings, and Mahatma Madhara teachings, is the Dokhi teaching. So now, part of that is kind of

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:03.720
 general explanation of the Dokhi, Dokhi's history, or how it started in Tibet. But now, how we to

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:10.810
 practice this Dokhi teaching? How we practice this? Here, sit, sit here. To essence, we're required

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:10.840
 to

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:17.400
 actualize the insight and the primordial wisdom. Generally, we have the primordial wisdom, right

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.600
 here, right here, with you, and with me, everyone, that's the Kaurabha teaching of the Buddha,

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:33.080
 and Gaurabha Masambhava, everyone. But how we actualize that? How magnetic? See clearly that we can

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.080
,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.480
 why we don't see clearly that we make it, so I make it many times, and there is no

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:47.880
 obscurations. The habit dependence, habit dependence, obscurations, there is very, very

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:56.360
 heavy and thick, they're completely blocked, blocked, blocked and don't see that, that clearly.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:04.440
 So how we discover that? That is then following the path of the Dokhis, path of the Dokhi. Now,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.520
 to do that in the Dokhi teaching, in the highest teaching I've mentioned so many times, is called

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:17.640
 "instantly teaching," that instantly gets realization, realization. But however, even though

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.360
 teaching is an instantly technique, yet our hard-headed duality cannot break through easily,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.200
 therefore, we have to follow the graduating, gradually, gradually path we have to follow.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.200
 For that reason, we started practicing, such as Mundo practices, or taking the raffus,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:47.240
 take the raffus to the Vada Dharma Sangha, and then raffus is foundation, then develop the body

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:56.120
 and then, along with that, pour in our second thoughts. Those are so important, because those

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:04.920
 well, through softening our duality, regiment, clinging, attachment to the samsara, or to our

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:12.920
 self-important attitude, it really will loosen up. Often we heard, "Bless me to mature my mind."

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:22.040
 What means "mature" in mind? What our mind is not mature? At that end, it directly is not mature,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:29.470
 it's hard-headed, even though it may be delicious apple, but it's not mature. Or maybe it's

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.040
 delicious

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:40.920
 banana, but it's not mature. Because why? Grasping, clinging, negative emotions. All that,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:47.720
 we have to soften up that. Not as soon as we can soften up, as soon as we can do it. Even

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:55.080
 Loki teaching is the most powerful, so directly teaching, but yet, our duality conceptions,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:03.160
 so strong. And our, those obstacles I listed the other day, five obstacles, or five rubbles,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:11.880
 are so strong. They're really always attacking us. Even in the teaching, I said, even you highly

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.760
 realize that quite good progress in the past, still they can attack you. This, that, what I

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:27.560
 propose, the rubbles, it's not just a short-time rubbles. This is going to rub our self for a long

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:35.400
 time. Therefore, we practice, you know, always should be watchful, careful to our self that

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:44.440
 we are not trapped within that. Again, back to that. Even the bigger, good, highly accomplished,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:51.160
 there's so many stories, highly accomplished, trapped and held on. Really, there's so many stories,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:59.000
 stories. So, therefore, we have to be hard, strong, and a detergent, diligent, and a

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.600
 disarmature. And courage is one. Courage is one. Courage is one, and practice, within the teaching,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.970
 empowerment. Practice that with joyful effort, with devotion, joy, and appreciation. And very

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.400
 humble

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:23.480
 and simple, drawn to the earth, any practice meditate. Then, gradually, we're going to revere

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.440
 our nature, our nature of this Buddha nature. Gradually, as I said the other day in the teaching,

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:38.680
 then gradually we become more bright, more bright, more clay, more clay. Then we become

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:45.560
 the really good practitioners. Good practitioners, but still watchful with all the obstacles, with

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:53.160
 mindfulness, aliveness, and consciousness. Then, also, when that happens, what happens is the sign

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.640
 of the realization in the teaching making, your wisdom is well, more growing. More love and

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:06.440
 compassion is more growing. More your, more passion, the tolerance is more coming, more stronger,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.680
 and stronger. Those are the signs of the achievement, the realization. And you become

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:21.050
 all mellow, not so tense, more losing of ourselves. That, and those over, then those are the signs

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.160
 of

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:29.320
 the achievement is like this, actually, inside. Then really begin to see that, truly, that. And

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.560
 then,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.720
 then continually discovering that when it comes on, the wisdom, or the discrimination, awareness,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:45.800
 the wisdom of the intelligent wisdom, when they are formed, formed gradually to become stronger,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.720
 stronger, and then become the western. Here's the primordial wisdom, the discovered primordial

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:58.120
 wisdom. The primordial wisdom is an inherently natural of our own sight. We have, I think,

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.200
 when we mentioned the other day, we went through it, and yet, I'm sure you know many in the

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:02.840
 teaching,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.720
 but primordial wisdom is five times all out within our Buddha nature, within the Dokki nature,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.240
 within the Dachangaba status. So that nature, then we discover all that gradually, one after

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.840
 another,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.360
 another, we reach a higher enlightenment, or in the Dokki teachings, when you see the

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:28.120
 nature according to Dokki level. Also, when you continue meditating and receiving practices with

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:35.560
 the devotional stone, with devotion and joy and appreciation, then we get the realization of the,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:42.120
 seeing the true nature, exactly as it is. First and foremost, our understanding of true nature,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.600
 of the nature of the mind is, even though nature is always in the arts, even though,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.520
 whether introducing, pointing out the teaching, we go through, through, but still, we kind of,

00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:01.800
 there's a real blocking, really, to see the true nature, exactly as it is, because most of the time

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:01.800
,

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.680
 we believe to see true nature, something that, kind of, like some other form, or something

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:13.080
 that which I can rely, or I can rely, I can see, I can feel that. That's what we really think,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:21.080
 always, always think. So then it can be like, but then, nature is, ever can feel something,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.280
 that means, you're trying to realize that you're putting, we're trying to put the realization,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.480
 traveling in the consultations. Relation is not a conception, it's called the teaching.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:39.160
 It's not that, not, like, thought, concept, try to trap that. Relation is pretty from the

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.880
 conceptions.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.960
 So, nature is that, that, so that really, many times, we don't see, but however,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.120
 even though that we see, kind of, at the beginning time, intellectually, maybe we understand,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:01.160
 those are known as the intellectual views, in that way, the teaching said, we give to the thought,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.440
 view of the, the analytic, and we do, analytically, your understanding. Then that, when we are kind

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.760
 of with that, that is used that as stepping stones, continually embedded in the practice,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:22.840
 then we go beyond of that analytic views, then you discover, discover, exactly, nature as it is.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:29.880
 And that is the salt root of the one's own awareness, rarikata, in its way, rarikata,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:39.800
 salt root of one's own awareness mind. That is the perfect root, the call and the teaching.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:47.640
 And that seeing that, exactly as it is known as the stage of the, seeing true nature,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:54.760
 exactly as it is, then we continually expand, is getting stronger and stronger than expanding the

00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:03.160
 realization stages, also, the experience is increasing, and then reaching the view of the

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:09.080
 awareness. That means, if we got to understand the part at the beginning of now, everything really

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:16.120
 see most, that medalla of the three guys, as we heard so many times, but now you begin to see

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:23.240
 our own self, the naked status. And then beyond, the thought state is known as, that the ultimate

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:30.040
 state of true, true natures. Natures, natures, those are the pole stages of zoki, you know,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:36.120
 kind of practice, and when you practice in tattoo practices, or toggle practice, those are the

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:44.120
 teachings here. So that time, then definitely, we discovered all the five Muslims. And these five

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.120
 Muslims, and the five guys are in the reality, and they said here, is the Buddha summoned, but

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.440
 it's free from the abandoned attachment. Because this Buddha, what we discovered, is not something

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:04.040
 that newly arrived, newly happened. It is the origin in the nature that we discovered. They

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:12.600
 discovered, therefore, it is beyond, beyond of the, beyond, abundantly, or beyond, there is

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:12.840
 something

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.920
 that we're going to lost, and regain. No, it's always been there, that we're not, not gaining

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:24.640
 anything. For that reason, in the teaching of the heart suttara, there is, uh, uh,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:31.080
 prabhayami, matupayami, there's nothing to gain, nothing to lose. In the heart suttara, you have

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:38.600
 maybe better translations. Nothing gain, nothing to lose. This is the origin in any nature, as it

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:38.840
 is.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:47.160
 It's the origin here. But however, in the duality conception, we lost it. Because

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:55.000
 meters of our own dualities, we lost it. So now we have to regain back. Let's discover that,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.840
 that. And that, that is, that is the origin of the Buddha summoner-buddha. The summoner-buddha

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:10.520
 is not the same name of the tathagata-garbha. summoner-buddha, tathagata-garbha, oh, it is like,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.560
 I mean, origin nature. How is this Buddha summoner-buddha? The great master,

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:26.840
 Chandra, not Chandra, said, you know, his, his great logic, logic teaching, logic teaching,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:34.440
 reasonable teaching. And he said, this dharma, summoner-buddha, summoner-buddha is a pre-pro,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.880
 all the nets of the consulsions, pre-pro nets of the consulsions, net, N-E-T-R, the net of

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:52.040
 the consulsions. And it has performed me, performed the qualities of the, of the Gaias and the

00:28:52.040 --> 00:29:05.960
 Muslims, and emanating the beneficial light into every direction without any partialities. And that

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:16.840
 is, and I, I pay homage to that summoner-buddha, to that summoner-buddha. This great master,

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.000
 logician, logician, and who is the one of the leading master of the also mind on the school.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:33.320
 He said that in teaching. So that is the origin of summoner-buddha, the our own,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:46.440
 our own is teaching. The other day there is many, and a quarter, many, uh, in a zoki teaching,

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.040
 in a zoki teaching, there is like, uh, prud, divisions of summoner-buddha. There is the

00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:00.200
 first summoner-buddha is called post-buddha summoner-buddha. This is the origin of buddha,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:08.600
 post-buddha ever. That is the, but, but then the self-heverness summoner-buddha, that's what

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:16.650
 is pointed out here. One's own nature, within the nature of the mind, self-heverness summoner-budd

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:16.760
ha.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:24.520
 That summoner-buddha is, is. And when you got that realization, when you discovered, discovered

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.240
 that,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:33.240
 then the samsara is summoner-buddha, and the niran is summoner-buddha, or samsara is zopa-chimbo,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:41.080
 niran is zopa-chimbo, and path is zopa-chimbo, zopa-chimbo. There is, everything is a zoki state,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:48.120
 and then nothing is not outside, or outside the zoki state. All is in zoki state, zoki state.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.640
 That part, for that reason, in a great, great mother, ukimba, said, you know, in his teachings,

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.000
 said. But

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.600
 apparently, the summoner-buddha, emptiness is summoner-buddha, and happiness is summoner-buddha,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:10.040
 suffering is summoner-buddha, summoner-buddha, summoner-buddha, and within the state of the

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:18.120
 kundasambhu, there is no death and birth, and all is, part of the display of the primordial wisdom.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:25.080
 Nothing. The death and the birth is a notion of the conceptions and the dualities. Reality

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:33.640
 now is all displays. And for that reason, the every, and he said, now kunda tomokonda kudu jen,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:44.520
 did all these summoner-buddha states, states, states. So, therefore, therefore, that is called

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:51.320
 path-zoki, path-zoki, because when we don't have the realization of it, as it is, then we follow

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.040
 in the path, exactly, with the instructionals, start with the rafu, and the bodhijeta, and the

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:01.720
 po-renoza, the toad, all those who believe the toad, and the practice, the meditation, exactly as

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:01.720
 in

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:10.040
 the teaching and structure, and then it's called the path-zoki, that is the seren, and then we

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:17.240
 go to the next one, and the next one is yutupindel lom-saas, som-saan-tayyawala-gom-yaas.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.960
 And all the
