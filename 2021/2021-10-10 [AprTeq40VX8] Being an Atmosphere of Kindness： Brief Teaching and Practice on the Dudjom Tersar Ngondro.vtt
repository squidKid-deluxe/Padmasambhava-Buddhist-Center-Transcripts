00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.100
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you. So we have the great good fortune of joining

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 together again for a very brief window of time to reflect on the Buddha Dharma and to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 activate the nature within our own hearts and our own minds. So then, as usual, we begin

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.200
 by activating that nature. So we'll just connect to our Bodhichitta, our genuine

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.800
 compassion, and our love for all beings. And then we'll kind of turn that on and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.920
 then have that a kind of fresh waking wisdom energy kind of guide our

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.720
 reflection, our study, our practice in this little window of time we have

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.580
 together. So if we all just take a moment and then kind of turn on Bodhichitta.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:46.680
 So I thought today to kind of speak on the topic of kindness.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:01.600
 Kind to ourselves and kind to each other. And then just in general kind of what it

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.080
 means to kind of permeate an atmosphere of kindness that other people can just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 kind of relax into and be themselves in. So I think in a simple way a lot of the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.320
 Buddha Dharma is so vast and so profound just because the nature is so vast and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.760
 so profound. Because cause and effect is so vast and so profound. And so it's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.160
 always good to come back to some of the essential kind of really key points like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.680
 in the end kind of what does it come down to. It's good for me to just kind of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.940
 highlight those points in my mind and really touch base with them as Venerable

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.760
 Kemper Ramichy likes to say to really to get grounded and get settled and just

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.400
 check in and reactivate like what it what am I doing? How am I spending my time?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.200
 How's my how's my practice going? How am I showing up in my life with other

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:18.520
 people? I think it's it's good that moment of pause is a special type of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:31.320
 generosity to become like a a kind setting or a kind atmosphere where other

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.600
 people feel supported to just show up as as they are as themselves. I think this

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.880
 is a deep Dharma teaching because the nature is always going to unfold as it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.000
 does regardless of whether we like it or not or we understand it clearly or not.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.240
 Cause and effect keeps happening. It's an infallible system on the relative level

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:05.320
 of truth and so like setting a table of just kindness for what might happen today

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.040
 for who might show up for what emotions might arise for what events what once

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.920
 unexpected challenges what beautiful surprises like kind of permeate an

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.960
 atmosphere of kindness of gentleness Sheila or morality in Buddhism is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.560
 sometimes venerable Kemper Ramichy's and their door to inconceivable and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.240
 compassion door to inconceivable wisdom and compassion they translate morality

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 sultrum as gentleness which is so deep it's just kindness is one of those key

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.840
 points in Buddhism that if if we put a lot of time on the cushion and we study

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.120
 a good amount that in overall it should kind of settle us down and make us more

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:08.520
 hospitable hosts to life happening around us we should become more

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:17.280
 welcoming of like what's arising in me what thoughts and emotions are arising

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.880
 in me like kind of have a much more like kind of soft welcoming curious response

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.800
 like wow what's this happening now or someone you know we kind of come in

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.560
 contact with someone and like what a big offering that if we can be kind enough

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.120
 to ourselves to just more or less be like you know kind of baseline like I'm

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.880
 pretty good with myself and we can free up some energy that when we come in

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.200
 contact with other people then we can really kind of turn our minds and wonder

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.840
 like what could I do for this person how could I be a little more accommodating

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.120
 how could I be a little more skillful a little more kind a little more helpful

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.680
 and that becomes just a natural kind of turn of mind because we kind of aren't

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.880
 so much in conflict with ourselves against ourselves according to like

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.400
 certain standards who were like really tightly trying to hold ourselves to and

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.440
 then of course then we're not pointed outwards always trying to like hold

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.520
 everyone to our standards instead we kind of show up according to how they

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.360
 are and what makes them relax and what makes them happy

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:53.040
 like I think as we continue on the path we should become more kind people his

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.480
 Holiness the 17th Gia Wang Karmapa was giving a talk he was asked to preside

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.980
 over the final kind of concluding ceremony of his Eminence Thaisa to

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.320
 Rinpoche his eight-year Mahamudra training session all these people

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.800
 committed to eight years of daily practice and coming together annually and

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.240
 so his Holiness Karmapa was going to preside over the concluding ceremony in

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.800
 front of all these people have put in eight years of time committed to this

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.880
 kind of Mahamudra training session and his Holiness Karmapa he came to the

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.640
 event and the main point he emphasized is at the end of all this we should be

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.200
 good people that if we do really high-level teachings and somehow we end

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:51.160
 up not being good people is something went wrong so also his own his Eminence

00:07:51.160 --> 00:08:00.400
 Thaisa to Rinpoche says Darma is pretty simple be kind and he says everything is

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:12.280
 illusory and the third point you are Buddha and this is the three principal

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.440
 points of the first turning second turning third turning teachings of all

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.000
 the vast teachings of Buddha are so profound and vast be kind everything's

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.800
 illusory you are Buddha in a system of cause and effect the best thing we can

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.680
 do is to be kind to show up in ways that like go with the flow of what's

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.040
 happening according to like what makes me and others happy what actually makes

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.640
 us relax and settle and feel supported and like let more of our own innate

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.000
 brilliance and compassion and kindness come out what actually serves that

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.940
 purpose so at the very least if it's a complicated cause and effect what's

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.200
 going on in someone else's mind what's going on in my mind it's so complicated

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.520
 but at least we can permeate an atmosphere of kindness of gentleness in

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.520
 that way our morality is like such a generosity for others we're not just

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.280
 holding ourselves to strict standards we're like creating a space where it's

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.920
 easy for people to trust us it's easier for people to be like oh this person is

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.880
 genuinely like sincerely like you know interested in me they're like actually

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.960
 listening they want to know like what's going on with me they're curious it's

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:45.080
 just basic kindness it doesn't have to be so complicated knowing exactly what

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.720
 helps make someone else happy that's very sophisticated you have to achieve a

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.360
 exceptional amount of realization of like how cause and effect functions to

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.800
 have that level precision understanding and awareness so these noble ones that's

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.760
 why they're so skillful because they hit the remark every time with how all the

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.800
 vast matrices of cause and effect are they hit the exact point where everyone

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.360
 can relax a little more in a situation just bursts into like a more fuller more

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.220
 rich more diverse expression of itself and they know exactly that point to hit

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:27.720
 homage to the noble beings but if we're not there yet we can at least like

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.520
 permeate an atmosphere of like kindness actually showing up with interest in

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.440
 what's happening around us what's happening in myself instead of seeing

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.280
 things as being an enemy or something I have to like cower away from Mingier

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.120
 Rinpoche says our emotions we usually kind of think of them as either an enemy

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:54.760
 or a boss an emotion arises anger oh yes I have to go along it's a boss or

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:02.280
 anger arises oh there's the enemy I have to target the enemy that's bad so we're

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.120
 constantly in conflict with ourselves either way we're either serving whatever

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.560
 happens to pop into our experience and not all of it leads to happiness or

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.260
 we're constantly trying to like fight it or fix it run away being kind is like

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:28.540
 giving something space to like see how see what happens and that really

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:36.460
 includes for ourselves like a one way a little more secular way I think and talk

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:43.120
 about this is like letting ourselves be human beings this first first point of

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.760
 Buddha's teaching first turning be a good person and you're just a human we're

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:56.280
 just human beings we don't have to be Buddha's yet third turning that there's

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.960
 Buddha nature that's there's Buddha nature as a potential that doesn't mean

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:07.680
 we should pretend we're Buddha's we need to see clearly our potential but first I

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.280
 have to show up as me and you have to show up as you and we have to create

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.520
 ours given ourselves an atmosphere where that's okay this is what makes me happy

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:26.000
 this is what makes me upset okay now I'm gonna actually deal with reality I have

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.040
 these habits okay and we kind of have an atmosphere of kindness so simple but so

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:44.240
 difficult to do right because we're very like complicated beings it's so many

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:50.120
 habits which is beautiful we're very there's so much richness to work with be

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:58.800
 kind then secondly it's all illusory like what experience have we had that

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:06.080
 doesn't become a memory if we really try to trace where is this memory of

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:14.760
 yesterday where is this youth I keep looking back to where is this big plan

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.520
 that's gonna happen you know it's upcoming vacation or the you know where's

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.560
 my grievance really someone wronged me and I keep repeating that story in my

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.760
 mind and like where is it if we really try to be a little you know clear clear

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:41.200
 minded about it where is it actually happening it's just memory it's just a

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.900
 memory happening in our mind what we can know is certainty in Buddha Dharma is

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:56.000
 awareness is happening memories happening anticipations happening this

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.480
 present moments happening the awareness is happening that we can certainly know

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.760
 it's self-evident but it changes as it happens it constantly moves as it

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:18.840
 happens it's illusory there's really nothing we can hold on to and so we have

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.640
 to really kind of

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:31.720
 then we get to see what it's like when when we don't go along with the

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.120
 illusory nature and we want to keep everything locked in place we get to

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.840
 directly experience what that feels like does it help our happiness or does it

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:51.960
 not that's a something we all get to see for ourselves just because it's a dream

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.760
 like it doesn't mean it doesn't happen it still happens it's just constantly

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:10.600
 unfolding there's just no fixed anything we can find in it even a fixed to me or

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:17.200
 a fixed you so all of a sudden it's very flexible it's illusory we have a lot of

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.600
 freedom to really like put our mind to what we want to put it to it's actually

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.960
 very empowering that it's illusory we can make it a really really really

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:38.040
 really good dream but it's only ever gonna be a dream we can make this such a

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.200
 good dream for each other we be kind to ourselves free up a little space and

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.920
 energy all of a sudden all that becomes available with how we're engaging with

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.920
 each other and then we can really become like a friend to everyone they said that

00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:03.440
 buddha shakimuni was a friend to everyone even if they didn't know it he's so kind

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:14.840
 then you are Buddha Buddha nature's here the third turning teaching if it's

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.520
 illusory and totally flexible and everything's always kind of happening and

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.200
 dissolving as it happens there's nothing we can really hold on to forever in any

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.960
 kind of a fixed statics permanent way if everything's constantly arising and

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.440
 dissolving arising and dissolving and we start to kind of settle down our minds

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.520
 with some kindness and clarity and like start to actually see this is actually

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.920
 how this is happening if we look at material things or immaterial mental

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.320
 things like that is actually how it's happening all the time then what starts

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.080
 to come out is all these loving qualities this Buddha nature comes out

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.120
 when we loosen up what we find is this incredible power the power of the Buddha

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.160
 nature of our own natural goodness so this becomes a normal type of kindness

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.960
 like his only style alama my religion is kindness all the sudden this is talking

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.200
 about the expression of the Buddha nature and which is exceptionally

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:21.080
 profound teaching and so many in sutras even to even consider the possibility

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.960
 that all Buddhas are all beings have a Buddha nature the merit of just for a

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.880
 moment considering that everyone has Buddha nature it's like so much vastly

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:46.520
 more special than just seeing oh one moment of impermanence and the Buddha

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.100
 taught also the conception that everything is impermanent is like the

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.720
 elephant put footprint all other footprints fit within that it's the best

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.840
 conception we can have isn't the idea that it's all impermanent but even

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.720
 compared to that just to just to allow the possibility maybe everyone is just

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.760
 fundamentally has this awakened enlightened energy this nature is always

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.920
 good it can never not be good what a kindness that would be that's how we

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.840
 engage with each other that's how we see ourselves I'm fundamentally not broken

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 I'm fundamentally good everything is fundamentally has this enlivened

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:40.160
 enlightened nature Buddha nature and then we start like kind of working with

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.760
 that with people first instead of the things we see that we don't like or the

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.520
 our you know mind we're like having a biological experience and so my mind

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.760
 picks out the things that are scary or disgusting and my framework or like kind

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.040
 of trigger me in some way and so I always look at what's wrong it's like how

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.040
 I that's the survival instinct of evolution but evolutionary biology it's

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.300
 like helped us keep going but it doesn't serve in this context to actually see

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:15.320
 the Buddha nature first not the 1% thing that's off but to see that part of

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.520
 ourselves that are there regardless of whatever else shows up the unchanging

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:30.800
 Buddha nature and I think this is when it really becomes a question of like how

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.160
 can we actually handle the complexity of life because it's so complicated there's

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:43.400
 so many things to juggle we want to be kind but we keep getting hurt we want to

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.800
 see that it's illusory but it's really hard this third turning point of there's

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:57.640
 Buddha nature everyone has it no one's left out and it's unchanging it's always

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:10.320
 there fundamentally pure each of us what an what an awesome generosity that is no

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.080
 matter what mistakes we make no matter what we say wrong no matter how we mess

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.960
 up no matter what we win what victory we have that we all equally have the exact

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:26.080
 same Buddha nature which is perfect and stainless and can never be altered or

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:38.000
 interrupted that's such an amazing extraordinary depth of kindness and it

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.160
 can show up in infinite varieties of ways it doesn't have to show up in the

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.200
 way I want it it can show up in countless ways this Buddha nature we

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:58.000
 give everyone the space to show up how they want to show up so kind then we can

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:07.080
 actually serve beings in helpful ways not force anything on them these three

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.840
 points are so deep be kind it's illusory you are Buddha or you could say you have

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.400
 Buddha nature these are three principal points you know this is really first

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.120
 turning second turning third turning or foundational Buddhism sutra Mahayana

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.440
 that's a pinnacle of Madhyamaka that goes into the Madhyamaka into Shintong

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.480
 with the Buddha nature teachings and then on top of that are in addition

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.860
 these are like coiled wires right we have kindness wire and then we have the

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.320
 illusory wire and then we have the Buddha nature wire and then we have all these

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.640
 skillful means and methods to actually recognize this right now this fundamental

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.180
 goodness we have right now and that's in the very fabric of all experience this

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.600
 illusory emptiness fabric all these wires are coiled together and they make a

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:05.280
 single wire and that single wire is Vajrayana and we don't get Vajrayana

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.320
 without all the wires together I have to have kindness in the illusory nature and

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.200
 Buddha nature and then we add on the skillful profound means like vast

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.680
 skills and methods where once we really think this is we try to show up with

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.080
 kindness this is all illusory manifestation and it's fundamentally

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.080
 good then we have the foundation for these skillful means to arise we can use

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.920
 any experience any sense experience any moment to help us reconnect with that

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.800
 goodness in ourselves and others and then it becomes not so much like oh I'm

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.800
 Vajrayana when I'm sitting down in a session and I get up and I'm just

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:50.160
 rock-but-normal ordinary person then we can try to be you know Vajradhara all

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.200
 the time or Chenrezig all the time or Amitabha all the time or whatever the

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.060
 specific set of skillful means in the mandala we're working with and we can

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:03.280
 keep kind of re weaving into that mandala our daily experiences because we

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.200
 have these foundations of kindness illusory nature Buddha nature in a

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.560
 single unified synthesis then Vajrayana is a natural next step it just happens

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.680
 you can't even stop it it just would come

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.320
 so these are just three a few simple things I think it's good to check it's

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.480
 really it's good to come back to the basics the basics are just the heart and

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.160
 the lungs and the brain and the it's all these are all needed for us to you know

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.960
 use our time really really well and then at the same time just it's just even a

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:55.600
 moment of contemplating kindness emptiness illusory nature Buddha nature

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:05.280
 devotion so then that goes into Vajrayana pure perception and devotion any

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.160
 little moment of reflecting on this or putting this into practice is such a

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:15.240
 beneficial kind accommodating exceptionally important use of our time

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:24.160
 it's like directly connected to our own natural goodness and if we connect our

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.400
 own natural goodness all the sudden we become an atmosphere that someone else

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:37.360
 when they come in contact with us they can relax finally I can relax and be

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.700
 myself and then what happens is then their Buddha nature their natural

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.600
 goodness starts just sparking out and their own amazing unique surprising

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:53.920
 waves and then we can co-create cultures of all these different unique brilliant

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.520
 insightful ways of coming together because we fundamentally are like like

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.240
 created an atmosphere of kindness and attentiveness and curiosity and like

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.880
 playful fun it's not so fixed and rigid it's not so tight and said according to

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.960
 what any one of us want but we're really co-creating something and we get this

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.880
 elegance all these seemingly divergent variant things come together in unified

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.840
 streams and we create these beautiful harmonious communities these sanghas

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:37.280
 right and the largest level of Sangha is all sentient beings all sentient beings

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.560
 are part of the Sangha and then we get all Buddhists and then we get all you

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.680
 know it goes smaller and smaller how we define Sangha then we get Vajrayana

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.520
 practitioners then we get the Sangha that's actually received the pith

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.440
 instructions at the feet of a master at the same time but in the biggest

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.960
 context of Sangha we're all Sangha every single being is part of our Sangha

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.160
 they're all welcome to come to this party and we have to set a place for

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:13.480
 every one of them that's our job as a bodhisattva what did this person what

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.040
 did they want to eat tonight for dinner what makes them happy because we put a

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.700
 little piggy in a British you know table setting that won't make the piggy happy

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.720
 piggy one's a big thing of mud that's what makes a big happy

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:41.880
 kindness is really taking the time what makes you happy I'm gonna actually pause

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.280
 my own internal this and that I'm gonna be kind enough to myself to trust oh I'm

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.560
 a good person so I'm gonna pause all this internal conflict for just even a

00:26:52.560 --> 00:27:00.200
 moment and then all of a sudden it opens up what makes you happy what would you

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:08.000
 like right now then we're talking about actual friendship this has to be a

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.280
 foundation for actual community for trusting each other for working through

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.800
 challenging times together for sharing our resources for learning from each

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.640
 other it's like really has to be founded on these deep levels of friendship and

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.840
 kindness mutual respect my religion is simple

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.720
 kindness right his only sala lama says but it goes all the way through the

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:49.640
 Yana's of the Buddha Dharma all the way into the innermost Yana's to become like

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:58.880
 a really genuinely concerned loving host and then set the table as if like the

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.720
 most honored treasured guest is coming and then that's called a moment of life

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.600
 and we constantly are trying to reset that table and then we go and another

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.560
 person is invited and we share a little moment or two with them and then we

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.000
 reset the table and another person's invited and they come and we don't play

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.960
 favorites and choose who shows up to our event it's really open door and people

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.600
 keep coming and experiences keep happening and we keep being kind and

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:37.480
 showing up and it just an atmosphere where people can relax and our own

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.280
 natural goodness can come out and then the deep power of the Buddha nature can

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.520
 really start to shine and then we can be supported by all these lineage blessings

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.480
 and all these profound instructions and practices we have that when we start

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.800
 relaxing in deeper and deeper ways we start letting ourselves settle down and

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:07.200
 showing up for like what's going on in me now that oftentimes a lot of

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.800
 resistance will come up because we're just not used to being that

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.520
 accommodating to ourselves and so we've like tucked away a lot of little pockets

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:25.560
 where we're not really so comfortable looking at yet being conscious of and

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.760
 so these pockets of unconscious kind of habits will come up and at that point

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.000
 that's really where these lineage blessings and these profound techniques

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.280
 are so vitally important we need these supportive structures in order to relax

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.840
 again and relax again and relax again and we have like a full nundra practice

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.720
 and the sadhana has a noble beginning noble middle noble conclusion and like

00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:02.720
 we can settle ourselves within that rise and set of each cycle we don't have to

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.400
 recreate it every time we can relax into the boundary relax into the context the

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.540
 container the setting it's like a womb or it's like that you know how we're

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:19.920
 being held we can use that limitation actually to like find that kindness and

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:28.360
 that illusory nature the Buddha nature in ourselves in each moment and we owe such

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.920
 a big gratitude for all these noble beings who've like shared these

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.160
 teachings with us and are continuing to preserve them and spread them and then

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.680
 also to the kindness of our parents the kindness of our friends the kindness of

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.800
 ourselves that we keep showing up we keep really trying to bring out love we

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.600
 keep trying to honor trying to listen like the genuinely like we it's so

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.460
 amazing we all keep showing up to this party and here we get another

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.220
 opportunity to set the table oh what's gonna make you happy and then we can

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.300
 play a little bit you know and doesn't have to be some big deal it can just be

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.040
 like a nice mutually shared kind of uplifting thing and then it's illusory

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.240
 it goes and then we have another so really how wonderful thank you all for

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.880
 showing up again and again and again I really pray that every single one of us

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.880
 all of our Sangha sisters and brothers every single sentient being we all keep

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:33.960
 showing up in a loving accommodating kind way because there's no escape we're

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.440
 all gonna keep showing up anyway so we might as well just be kind like the

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.880
 logic of it is really tight so why not you know go right to the fruition now

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.000
 because the Buddha nature is just kindness nature of mind is just unfettered

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 completely unrestricted kindness utterly accommodating of all experience doesn't

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.840
 play any favorites or exclude anything it's completely allowing so thank you

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.360
 for all showing up thank you to the great masters for really preserving and

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.840
 turning this wheel of Dharma again and again and again and really so now we

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.520
 have this little session together we'll do this do Jim Taresar Nundro and we'll

 begin with his Holiness do you remember chase spontaneous prayer calling llama

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.400
 from afar reconnecting to this goodness in ourselves and allowing it to just

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:39.680
 really saturate our experience thank you all so much thank you

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:49.840

 the primordial ground of one's own awareness is unchanging and unmoving

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.840
 whatever arises as the expression of the Dharmakaya is neither good nor bad

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:22.480
 since awareness of nowness is actually the Buddha the completely free serene

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.240
 Lama is revealed in one's innermost heart when this original mind is

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.800
 realized as the very nature of the Lama there's no need for whining contrived

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.160
 prayers made with grasping and attachment by letting go in the free

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.960
 natural flow of uncontrived awareness not holding whatever arises the blessings

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.280

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.320

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.600
