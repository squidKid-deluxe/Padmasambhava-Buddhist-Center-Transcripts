00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much again for participating and welcome everyone.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Welcome again. And now we have just started doing a retreat together, which is a little wonderful.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 A little bit inspiring and helping to each other. And perhaps I say,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 you know, following the footsteps of the greatest teacher, Gautam Shatyamuni, Gautam Masamma,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 all the religious masters, which is wonderful. We're really making meaningful life,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 taking some good benefit and good result of our very disputable existing on this earth.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 So therefore, I thank you all, everyone, for participating and for we're together with this.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.310
 Now, again, I'm going to go through the teachings of the Dzogchen pith instructions as I've been

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.000
 doing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And so, in this way, always in the teaching set, or in all the masters in teaching set,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 again, before we do, we'll receive the teaching, start in the teaching, practice the teaching of

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.000
 the Buddha Dharma,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and strengthen our motivation. Intention is so important.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 And there's so many motivations and intentions, generally, and there's not even numbers there.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 But however, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni, summarized into three categories,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 and also we all know or heard this, and which is good intention, bad intention, and neutral

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 intentions.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 So this time, we're going to completely give way to the negative intention or bad intention,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 and then we're going to also activate our good intentions.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And this neutral intention, also even we're going to not keep that neutral intention,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 we're going to transform the neutral intention into the positive good intentions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And so that is really good. The mind is the foundation and the source of both samsara and nirvana.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 This time, we're trying to really follow the path of the teaching, or the path truth,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and then we will get realization, the results.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 So, the path truth and realization, or the path truth and the sociological truth, is nirvana.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Nirvana also begins with our mind. Similarly, samsara begins with our mind.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And there is also a small subtle point that good mind is the cause of the nirvana.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Bad mind is the cause of samsara. That's what every teaching says.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And as Nagarjuna said, and I kind of use the quotations of Nagarjuna's teachings,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 negative emotion is the very fundamental cause of samsara,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 and the positive mind is the very, very cause of the nirvana.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 So therefore, now we're following the path truth.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And among the path truth, generally, there is always the teaching said,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 distant path, short path, very, very short path, speed path.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And distant path, such as the suttara teachings, to the enlightenment,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 we're talking to the Buddhahort, not talking to just nirvanas.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 We're talking to the enlightened Buddhahort.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Distant path is the suttara teachings.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Mahayana suttara teachings, with you in the teachings said,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 if you follow the teachings of the suttara of Mahayana

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 with the bodhicata and good ethnic and everything,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 it will take at least three countless eons to reach the Buddhahort.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Enlightenment, three countless eons.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That also is really the, according to the teaching, what I said,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 also the path to a highly culpability practitioner of the suttara Mahayana

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 will take three countless eons.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Medium culpability practitioner of the Mahayana, suttara Mahayana,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 will take seven countless eons.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And the average culpability of the practitioner of the suttara Mahayana,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 it will take thirty-two countless eons.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So three countless eons, even considered in the suttara Mahayana,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 is quite speed, past.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 But this time, according to the linear masters,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 divided into three.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Distant path, short path, very short path.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Short distance path is the suttara Mahayana, that takes those many eons.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And the short path is the outer tender teaching,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 which will take three lifetimes, five lifetimes, seven lifetimes,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 is the dependent outer tender practices to reach enlightenment.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And the quickest path to getting enlightenment is zobchi teachings.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 According to zobchi teachings, you will get enlightenment within our single lifetimes.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 But we need fuel to reach enlightenment.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 One is fuel, is courage, commitment, joyful effort, devotion, both each other.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Those are the fuel and knowledge and wisdom to understand and read teaching, teaching to the heart.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Generally, those fuels, as I use it, F-U-E-L, fuel, that's needed to all the practices.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 It's not just only zobchi teachings, but zobchi teachings are so fast, so quick,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 because it reveals the direct innate nature of our own, the inherited Buddha, instantly,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 and connected to all the natural, our own enlightenment, our own enlightenment of the rakwa,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 the southbound awareness, rakwa, ramzom, yihi.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Therefore, have you have devotion, both each other, joyful effort within these lifetimes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And great masters, such as Chaiti Sanghi also,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 and many others, those great masters whom keep up, they reach enlightenment not just this long,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 kind of life, this lifetime, but even in the years, twelve years,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 the absolute rainbow-boding enlightenment, that is what it is.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 But that all start with the motivation.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Motivation is the foundation.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 At this time, there we are talking of the activating good motivation,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 which is joy, appreciation, and then devotions, and both each other,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 and then purely understanding or the realization of the Vedayana teachings.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 So those are the needed motivation.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 With that motivation, then we follow with these teachings.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And here, we came to this now in Islam.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 I think you have all this.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 What is this?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 One, two, three, four, five, six, six, seven line.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 This is six and seven, six line, seven line, and eight line, line,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 and then as well as the next one is four, the three goals of the practioners.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 All that is we need always.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 It's not just once a time we should have that.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 This is we are going to maintain during all the time of our practice of this life

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 until we reach enlightenment.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 So that means what?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 We always trust in the three jewels.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Our three jewels are impiliable, social reference.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 With that trusty, we're going to do not mistake about the result

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 and the virtuous actions, particularly a devotion to the Lord's teachers,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 love and affection to the Samaya brothers and sisters,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 the bodhicitta of compassion towards all the mother-sentence beings,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 component things are impermanent and should be,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 and these are known as the four everlasting worlds of the practioners

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 and should be regarded as indispensable.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 With that intention, with that thought,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 and then do this, continue at this practice as it says, as N.T.T. said.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And I will go over these lines again,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 but quite little details of each of those forms.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 But first, I'm going to summarize entirely teaching the practices

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 into those three novels.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 On the day, I mentioned principal novelties, all the principal novels,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 all novels, three novels, the beginning novel, middle novel,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 concolating novel that encompass the entire practice of the teaching.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Now, again, we're going to think.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Generally, Buddha teaching, how you learn and absorb to the heart

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 and make a difference by what I'm teaching.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Studying, contemplating and practicing, those three are how we are studying.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Studying and contemplating is generally studying.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 What N.T.T. says, studying is you're studying with the meaning of the words,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 meaning of the teachings.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 That is so you are really looking, going up and analyzing

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 or reflecting the teaching of the book.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Contemplating is now, when you contemplate that teaching,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 what you've learned, now you contemplate it to your own intelligence,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 with your own heart.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 That's connected. What the teaching says, how you interpret it,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 what all the great masters said, all the great practitioners said about that

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 and kind of blending in with you so that you will have certainty wisdom.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Certainty wisdom.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 What we like to know, what we have to have.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Certainty wisdom.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Certainty.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 The study of the teaching of the Buddha, well,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 make that difference of the meaning of the word, what it says.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 But now, the quadruple enemy is explore the deep root of that.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Deep root of the teaching.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 That is, again, the greatest teacher, Buddha Chaturman himself said,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 you don't have to believe, you should not believe what I said.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 You must analyze yourself.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 It makes sense or it don't make sense.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Because Buddha teaching is teaching of the way things are, truth.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Truth exactly and where things are on the relative truth,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 where things are on the absolute truth.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 So this is, truth is not occupied by certain individualism or selected groups.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Truth is pervasive.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 As sunshine, as sky, sky or sunshine,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 it's not just a prayer only, and only then called the prayed evils

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 of some certain selected group, ghettos.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Everyone has ego.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So therefore, the exploration of the truth is so important.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Because the teaching is true, it's natural.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 So once you have done this, so that,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 the quadruple enemy, when you get the meaning,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 when you've really got some degree of meaning,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 now you start to practice.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 That is known as the other great masters, other great practitioners.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And the teachings said, other great masters said,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 the teachers said, the books said, or Buddha teachings said,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 now I understand, to me, it's really in my sense,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 and now I'm going to practice.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 That means what?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 We are going to practice with all the doubt and hesitations,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 the skeptics.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Practice with, practice with confidence,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 practice with joy, practice with appreciation,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 practice with thankful gratitude.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 We're going to practice because practice with reality,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 each of us exploring our own beauty of nature,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 our own beauty.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Our own beauty that will defeat all the troubles of the samsaras,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 all the difficulties of the samsaras.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 We are equipping ourselves strong and very powerful

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 and strength to defeat all the hindrance,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 troubles, difficulties, misfortunes, anxiety, depression.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Whether it is a mental problem,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 whether it is a psychological problem,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 whatever we're going to really defeat,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 defeat that into the emptiness.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 When we defeat it, even there's no trace that we find.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 That's what we're going to do.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 But that's what we're going to do by recognizing the truth,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 seeing the truth exactly as it is.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And therefore, we're going to do that with confidence,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 with the diligence, with the determinations.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 We're going to do this, not just only that for ourselves,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 we're going to do that for all the beings with our body together.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So therefore, this contemplation, that is so important,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 that will lead to the practice.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 So therefore, when it comes to the practices,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 practice, the Buddha teaching is as I said the other day,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 I mean, you know, we all know, it's not just I said

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and I'm saying this thing, thing, I heard this to you,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 I read this in the books.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Buddha told over 45 years teachings,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 and those teachings are summarized into 84,000.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 That teaching is also in the, in the teachings here,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 the great master, 12 excellent teachings.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 That 12 excellent teachings can be summarized

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 into three basket teachings, or three pedaka teachings.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 And so that three pedaka teachings, now what do we have to do?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 There is three particular pedaka teachings

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 you're studying and contemplate.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Now we have to practice.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 For that practice, not just only on the intellectual state,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 you have to absorb that into the heart and the practice as I said,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 we have to practice.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 When we practice this, what that really actually means,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 we have to discipline our mind.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Our speech, our vodice activity.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And how to do that?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 According teaching, actually, we like to discipline our self.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 That means we like to make more gentle, more peaceful,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 more simple one, then we have to start with the mind.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 That is the practice way to do.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Mind, that is. When the mind is become more gentle, peaceful, simple,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 naturally it will bring gentle, peaceful of the verbal

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 and as well as verbal activity, physical activities.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 So therefore, we have to do this.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 This will go to the mind, which is a source, which is root.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And that is then, when you come to the practice,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 and that I said, great master, un kimba, also highlight them.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 It's not just un kimba, but everyone teaching said,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 but highlight by the great master, un kimba.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 And that is then three novel, at least, or three novels.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Beginner novel, middle novel, and concluding novels.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Why it means, in the debate, it's called dhambasan, dhamba, dhambasan.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Dhamba means novel, or supreme novel.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Why it is novel?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 As I said, the Buddha gave all those teachings

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 in order to discover our inner nature, of the enlightenment, all that.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 And those all teachings are summarized into these three groups.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 So that means, according to this one,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 this is supreme among all the teachings, these three.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Or these are the novelties, most noble ones, of all the teachings.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 So that, in a way, we capture the essence of the entire teaching

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 of the Buddha Chakra meaning into these three simple frames,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 beginning novel, middle novel, and concluding novels.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Therefore, it is novel.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Since the novel, it will make us novel, novelty.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 It will bring the final novelties.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It is novel. It is.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 And now, what are those novels? In the teaching set, what is it?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 First novel is intention.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Sentential with both each other.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 And the second novel is then no grasping or clinging.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Meditation without clingings.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Third novelity or novel is inspiration and dedication.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 And that encompasses entirely practices.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Whether to reach enlightenment or to discover the ultimate novel.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Novel.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 First novel, also what is in the teaching set,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 first novel is a skillful means.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Skillful means novel of both each other or intention with both each other.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Skillful means that means the market.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 When you have this novelty of both intention of both each other,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 that is a skillful means.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 It will transform the second and third all the perfect.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 So it is really the foundation.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 It is a foundation.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 It is vital structures of the practices.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 When we practice, intention.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 That is...

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You're my subject, I think.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Sentient.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Sentient is like skillful means.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Skillful means is a matter of that intention.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 And second, how is named?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Named.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Named...

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 The practice will never going to damage it.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Cause or damage it spoils.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 By the method of the non-grasping meditation and practices.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 So this, if we practice the meditation without grasping, clinging,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 too much, or clinging,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 that practice, that merituring, merit will last forever.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Not just it lasts forever, it will multiply.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 It will increase.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Therefore, second is so important.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 It is holding together all the practice right as it should be.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Should be needed.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Third one, the final one.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 What is the final one? The final novel is aspiration and dedication.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 One in the teaching said that the last one, aspiration and dedication,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 will increase multiplying the merit all the time.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Even we are not practicing. Even we are not meditating.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 But when we do the practices, when we do the meditation,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 at the end we do the good aspiration and good dedication,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 that will multiply the merit even if we are not practicing.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Therefore, it is known as the multipliers.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 It will bring surplus and continuous surplus of the very, very choice.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 So therefore, these three are the novels in order to reach our self,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 to save all living beings in life.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 So that is really what I said. Now I said those three.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Now I go back to the beginning.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 The beginning of the novel is the intention with both each other.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So that means intention with both each other.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 What is the intention? Joy, appreciation, and both each other in devotion.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Those are the intentions. Those are the intentions.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Those are the foundations of our practices.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 That's how we begin. Mostly joy and appreciation. Joy of our lives. Joy of our situations.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Joy of that we are as beautiful human beings.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Joy of all the situations and circumstances that we are surrounded.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Even though we are in samsara, but we have the window of light, all of us.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 When we compare to the many beings who are going through all the difficulties,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 challenge one after another, endless, constantly.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Don't mention the three lower realms, but even these women's names, in this women's world,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 how many people are going troubled and difficult.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 But to compare with that, what we are and how they are going,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 we have much more to be celebrated of our situation, circumstances.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 If it is true or not, you reflect. Really.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Even your own tone, even though you own your places, you can see the examples where that happened.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Even the richest country in the world, highly developed country in the world,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 there are still so many things going on.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 We can be one of those to you, but we are not. Many of us are still so good.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Generally in the Buddha's teaching and all the great masters teaching,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 being as human beings is much more better, even going through all the difficult challenges,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 much more better and beautiful than the three lower realms.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.650
 You cannot really compare with situation and circumstances what going through in those three lower

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.000
 realms.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Why I am going to bring the three lower realms with human realms?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 According to Buddhism, you all know, I am talking Buddhism.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 According to Buddhism, the three lower realms are not just owned by select groups.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 It is all directed by our karma, our actions and cause and effects.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 But we are not in three lower realms, so that means we had good karma.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 That means we did something good in the past, even though we don't see the past.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 But this now tells, our situation tells the past being quite good.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 For example, if I have the delicious apple right in front of me, apple.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Or if I have apple, if I add this apple, apple, and see that apple is so delicious, choose.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 I can tell this apple, even I don't know where it grows, where it bored them,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 but that wherever it is growing, it must be good soil, good condition.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 That's why I have this delicious apple.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Apple even maybe is not good looking apple, but it is delicious and very good.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 That tells me something.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Even the good looking apple I have here right in front of me,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 but if I eat, it's not that good. It's not sweet.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Can't let it sour or can't strain the flavors.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 That tells, even though I don't see that way it grows,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 that soil, that condition, whatever, it's not that good.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 I can tell, that is inevitable deductions of the valid cognitions.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 For that reason, what the gracious teacher, Buddha Shatami said,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 "Read, present your deductive past.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Present well the doubt or inference of the past

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 and read your action of now and project the futures."

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 That's what really a very practical statement in practical teaching is true.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Present, our situation, our circumstance is the foundation.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 It is a code and conditions for our destinations.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Therefore, being as good or smart human beings,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 we have every right to do good things,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 which reflect for ourselves good all the way to the future

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 and also is good for the other beings.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Because being as Buddhism practitioners,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 what the gracious teacher Buddha said,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 "And help to the others, help to yourself, and fulfill your purpose."

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Two purposes.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Therefore, being as a citizen of the human beings or the world,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 we have every reason to really try to do good things.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And which is dharma, which is practice, which is so special?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 It is good for you, good for the others, good for us,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 in which we should do that.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 So therefore, this good intention is really the foundation.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 For that reason, as I'm talking now, bring more joy and appreciation,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 more grateful, more thankful.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Many times, our mind is always looking outside.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And not just outside, always looking far distant.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 We miss always our near, near or close ones, close.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 We don't kind of look, we're always with expectations,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 with hopes, looking some kind far and far.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And then we are missing the point.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 We're losing our ground of feet.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 We're looking all the time.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 We have to be practical.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Look to far horizons, but look to your own feet,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 your own standing.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Make stronger friends.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And when you look around us,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 we have so many to be thankful.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 We should be really thankful to our families, our friends,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 our, all the different situations, circumstances, fellow citizens.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And then bodhicandas always, in the bodhisattva thing,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 he said, "Sentin beings or other beings are so important."

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Like important guests, as like Buddhas,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 all everyone is so important, so kind and so special.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Special in order to reach our self with enlightenment,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 in order to become the Buddha.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 We have to have others.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Otherwise, how we can practice,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 how we can do all those meditation, practice and act,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 can't be like become stronger or something.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 So there, every level is really a whole.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 We should be thankful, grateful.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Grateful, joy and appreciation is the drone of enlightenment.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 That enlightenment begins with joy.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Enlightenment begins with, or Buddhahood begins with joy.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Buddhahood begins with appreciation, thankful.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 At the same time, courage and commitment.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 At the same time, more humble and more simple.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Don't let up, more powerful.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Advance with the creator.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 And then, with joy and appreciation.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And bodhicandas.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 We all know, we all heard this bodhicandas.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 Bodhicandas is a very practical,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 entirely Buddha teaching, particularly Mahayana teachers.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Even in the teaching, he said,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 bodhicatha makes a difference between

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 foundation of Buddhism school and Mahayana teachings.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 So bodhicatha is really the foundation of the Buddhahood, enlightenment.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 And therefore, activating bodhicatha.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And I'm going to talk those a little bit more forward.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 We all know, you all heard this bodhicatha so many times.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 From so many great masters, and really the books.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 But it's always in the Buddha teaching to remember,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 recollect, the preparation of the bodhicatha is marvelous.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 It's marvelous.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And therefore, trusting in the words of the Buddha teaching,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 I will go over the bodhicatha too.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I'm going to go on these meanings.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 That is bodhicatha is precious mind.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Mind.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 What the great Murphema Samba said,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 bodhicatha is a mind of Buddha.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 It's the Buddha.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Believe it or not,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 the moment we develop the bodhicatha,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 that moment we are to the Buddha status.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Buddha.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 What bodhicatha has, actually, in the teaching, say,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 compassion, loving-kindness, wisdom.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 That's three, these three.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Loving-kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 This is Buddha mind.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 This is enlightened mind.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 When we have that with joy and appreciation,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 truly enlightenment is shining quite brilliantly

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 in each of our heart.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 That is, it's true, not making up stories.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 That is really good.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 So bodhicatha is so, so important.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Once we have the bodhicatha strongly,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 combine, target with it, then devotions.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Devotions and pain are similar.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 As I said, pain and devotion.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Departime, moodiness, pain.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 But devotion is really joy, appreciation,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 confidence and richness feeling, openness feeling,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 that combined the beautiful mental attitude is devotion.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 That is the vapor.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Vapor, oh, yeah, vapor. This is warmth, warmth of both each other.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Warmth is just coming out the mist,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 the warmth mist of both each other.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 That we need to bloom the enlightenment fully.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 That most we need.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So this, therefore, what I said,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 I'm going to talk bodhicatha more and more of that,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 but I'm going, this is what I said.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Today, the foundation, beginning novel.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 The foundation novel is joy and bodhicatha and devotees.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 These three are really so, so important.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 This is not just important, the beginning time,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 but this is always we need.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Joy and appreciation, bodhicatha and devotion

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 during the meditation practices.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 If you bring that energy, it will rephrase our meditation.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 It will rephrase our practices, practices.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 And if we have that also, with this intention,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 it will keep our practice always fresh.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 It's not going to become boring, boring and tiring.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 I have all this, again, I have to do all these kind of things.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 I'm never going to.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 And we have the joy and appreciation, bodhicatha.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 When we did it, we made it.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 That's how it will increase all the marriage or marriage.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 So therefore, this is really important.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 So important.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 And therefore, it's called the beginning novel.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Beginning novel.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 And that is my talk for today.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Thank very much, again, for participating and for coming.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 And thank, okay, now we do the short meditation.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Thank you.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Thank you.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Thank you.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Thank you very much.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Thank you.
