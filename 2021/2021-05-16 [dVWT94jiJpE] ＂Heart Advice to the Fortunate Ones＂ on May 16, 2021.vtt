00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone's participation, and thank you

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.320
 again. Thank you very much, everyone, all your participation and making time and make effort,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.760
 joyful effort to the teaching. Thank you. Thank you. And again, this morning, we're going to

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.000
 go have two sessions. First session is I'm going to talk continuously on the teachings of the great

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.600
 master, H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche's teaching. Second session will be the practice of healing practices

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.680
 and as well as dharma-pala, and praise for all those who are accursed to do some prayers

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.480
 and thinking of them, and as well as everyone, we do those prayers and dedicate in the merit.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.560
 Those are the two sections that we will follow. First, again, the teaching. We go to teaching,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 and that is again, as I said, continuation teaching, that H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche's teaching that we

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.720
've been

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.370
 going through, that whenever you may be participating, like since the last year, we're really going

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.000
 on,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.080
 but why is it taking so long, this short, short, to continue? And we're going to let it thoroughly,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.720
 let it detail, and slowly by slowly so that it will is absorbed in our heart and mind,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.920
 teaching of the Buddha dharma, or some degree, reactivating your beautiful, precious memories

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.760
 that you received from many great masters, one after another, and trying to kind of bring them up

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.320
 of the verbal state as much as we can. That's the whole intention, intention, how we're doing this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.080
 slowly, kind of walking that. So in that context, again, in order to receive the teaching, again,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.200
 in the teaching, always, whether you're studying, contemplating, or meditating,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.960
 always have the beautiful motivations, intentions. That is joy and appreciation. Joy and

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.840
 appreciation,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.720
 many reasons, we activated that. And together with this, both each other, kindness, compared

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.840
 to thought for all living beings, remove the suffering, the difficulty, troubles of everyone,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.160
 or in other words, removing all the suffering, difficulties of the cause of suffering truth,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.000
 and suffering truth, completely eliminated that forever, really reaching that from the heart,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.360
 heart. And then, together with this, beauty realization, beauty and understanding of the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 Vedayana teachings, so kind of activated, all those are also we received teachings,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.320
 we all received teachings, so not just leave that on the side somewhere, but really bring up that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.400
 word really in the right now moment, just bring up those. Those are practices, those are not just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 heart of the practices, foundation of the practices, central column of our practice,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.560
 or journey to the Buddhahood, enlightenment. So therefore, we should not miss the point,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 the true essence of the dharmas. With those thought, again, we go continually on the teachings

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.720
 on this, that, and yes, again, we are on the last line of this first page, and we discussed

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.600
 about the teachers yesterday, all the variety of different teachers, according to the Buddha

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.480
 teaching, in the context of the three yanas, or Vinaya teachings, Sutra Mahayana teaching,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.360
 and the Vedayana teachings, those are qualifications in explaining the teaching. And again, we went

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.200
 yesterday, generally there is a board of four different categories of teachers, we are talking

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 about ordinary teachers, ordinary teachers. That means all many of the teachers can be

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.240
 still rigorous and in the beings, as like many of we, we are simple human beings, we are all human

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:25.280
 beings. Maybe many of those are really just simple human beings. Therefore, teaching is something

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.120
 important in the teaching said in the Buddhism. Therefore, the qualification teacher or good

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 teacher is good for the practitioners if we like to do. So those are, for that reason, the greatest

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.720
 teacher Buddha highlighted all those qualifications, how the good teachers are. And those are, we

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.200
 went

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.480
 yesterday, again, there's more than what we mentioned or what I said yesterday, there's really

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.080
 many, I'm sure many of you already know those things, but I went to highlight of those three

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.360
 different groups, as I said. And now there's maybe too many, too many I can't, can't figure out all

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.920
 that. How that is also summarized by the great master, Jungwoo Kontorem, he summarized this,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:23.520
 and really this all can be in this followingness, following points, following statements. And that

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.880
 is again, I will listed that and then go over. I mean, of course you will know what I mean, I'm

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:37.440
 saying you will know that. And the fourth one is one or teacher, one who maintains or keeping the

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.920
 vows and the samayas. That is one teacher, one who's keeping the vows and the samayas.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:55.360
 And the second is teachers that have the lineage teachings, lineage teachings.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:10.400
 And the third, that lineage teaching is not spoiled or interrupted or tarnished as the golden

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:20.720
 change, tarnished thought. Fourth one, the teacher who has knowledge of the Buddha's teachings,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:31.040
 of the Kanjur and the Dhanjur, or Ka, Timju, and Jyu in the teachings said so, or great master,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:39.360
 Jungwoo Kontorem said, that means the old Buddha teachings, Sotarak teachings, and Tantra teachings

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.360
,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.120
 as well as the commentary teaching, some really knowledge they have, knowledge they have that

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:57.840
 teaching. The last one is very kindness, compassionators. Compassionators, those are the

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.200
 highlighted

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 and summarized qualities of the teachers. All those what we went yesterday can be summarized

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:17.360
 onto that. This, first is that teacher who's maintaining to the vows and the samayas,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:25.920
 that dependent teacher, if that teacher is abasakas, or male and females, all the other,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:34.960
 that teacher is a body, Mahayana practitioner, and then bodhicata vows, or bodhisattva vows,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.800
 if that teacher is a practitioner of the Vedayana teaching, and then Vedayana vows and the samayas,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.000
 so maintaining those, and those are all listed in the teaching that many of you know that,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.360
 so I'm not going to talk over those things, but those samayas and vows are keeping quite the

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:06.080
 good intact status. Second is the lineages. Lineage teaching that started from the Buddha

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:17.040
 Samyas and the Badras, all the way until now, that lineage teaching is not what in the teaching

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:29.040
 you say, see the golden chain of the lineage, not tarnished or broken, pure lineage teaching,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.000
 the authentic lineage teaching, it's not just making up things and spreading that,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.480
 but it's truly, there's no drama, there's no immediately, directly is continuation teachings.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:53.040
 Those lineage teachings are then, I mean again, so that's not tarnished, not interrupted.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:04.800
 And then next one is, what's called, did I mention that there is this third one that who have the

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.280
 lineage instructions, repeat instructions, I said that, no that's really the third one,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.840
 then third one, so please insult that. Third one, who keep the, have the pit instructions

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.800
 and lineage instructions, maintain that, so that means this lineage, such as from the mind-to-mind

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.600
 estimation lineages, symbolic estimation lineage, oral estimation lineage, and the Kama

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.960
 instructions,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:41.440
 thermal instructions, all that maintain the well kept and who received, and that means

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:51.840
 that teacher is also practices, meditating on that topic, in some degree, realizations,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:01.200
 realizations. And then that teacher, the next one, the fourth one, is then have the knowledge

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:09.600
 of the Buddha's teachings, on the teachings and as well as commentaries, all that antara

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.720
 and sattaras and commentary teachings, some knowledge. And then the fifth one is kindness

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.920
 in the compassion networks, kindness and compassion networks. Those are the summarized

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.720
 qualifications of the, qualified teachers, whether that is man or that is woman,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.520
 woman. And that also what in the great master popular number you said in the teaching,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.800
 teaching said in the world is my perfect teacher, whenever you know and read that,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.720
 at the very beginning of that, one of the sections, how to contract with teacher or how to search

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:50.880
 the

00:10:50.880 --> 00:11:00.400
 teacher, at that beginning of that he said, the teacher, one is, is a contract with so many great

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.720
 masters. Teacher, one who is a contract with many great masters, accorded their instructions,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:20.160
 practiced and meditated, and now that teacher is authentically sharing that teaching

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:32.560
 to the others who are interested, to that great teacher, I pay homage. That's great master

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.720
 popular number you said. So that also indicating teacher is a practitioner or teachers are

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.680
 practitioners. Teachers are received so many teachings, the content with qualified teachers.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.480
 As they practice, as they receive the teaching, now they're sharing that with others, those who are

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:04.000
 interested in this. To that great teacher, or unequal, what great master popular number you said,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.160
 unequal, the great teacher, I pay homage. I pay respect. So that is what the teacher is.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.640
 And that means also teacher is not enlightened, as we said. It's human beings. Teachers are human

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:30.240
 beings, but they're doing the best practices and with those, those are the qualifications.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.520
 Now we mentioned very kind of little bit detail on the way in one way, even though there's many

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:45.520
 about the qualified teachers, but then also in the Buddha teaching said qualified students.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:57.600
 That is also important to make sure this connection, relationship between student and a teacher is

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:08.000
 long lasting call of connections, not just for short times or lunch breaks or just one week or

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.560
 day breaks or something. It's long last connections, according Buddhism. It is. And whether they're

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.560
,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.240
 for example, the teacher is alive or teacher is still past or entered the Mahabharata in Nirvana,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:29.440
 your root teacher will be a root teacher, according Buddhism, until we reach enlightenment.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.320
 And one day, therefore, always, I'm sure you read in the books, you heard that.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:43.280
 I hold the teacher, great teacher, until I reach the enlightenment.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.960
 And please hold me throughout my lives. Guide me throughout the lives. So let me be sure that I

00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:00.560
 reach enlightenment. Those are the really praise, those devotional prayers. When you reach the

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:08.800
 qualified, when you had the contact, that contact. So teacher, again, a student, there's so many

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:17.600
 explanation of the qualifications of the students that that qualifications. But to summarize that,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:28.080
 again, what great master, Master Arya Deva, foremost disciple of the Nagar Juna, he highlighted

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.520
 these three ways, simple three ways. That disciple or that listener, he said, listeners, that means

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:48.800
 we're going to receive the teaching. Listening first is very honest, positive, honest, and smart,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.480
 and genuinely interested to the teaching. Those three are the qualities.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.920
 That is a whistle to transfer the teachings.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:17.840
 Zuni means what? In the Tibetan world, Zuni, I translated it honest, but it also means

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:27.120
 the very open mind. It means open mind, relaxed, not partiality, not so kind of extreme,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.440
 not just kind of like, oh, I'm the best, or they're the bad. Come to that attitude.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:47.200
 Open mind, honest, calm, and peaceful. Open mind. And the Lodi in the Tibetan world,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:55.760
 I translated smart. Smart means have the knowledge or distinctive knowledge. What is good? What is

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:03.360
 bad? What is wrong? So that means full of common sense, nice, basic, good common sense.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.440
 Which is good, which is bad, or this is right, this is not correct. Correct. Kind of that

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:21.360
 distinctively, clearly shining the intelligence in the heart and the mind. Mind. That is

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:31.920
 distinctively. The Lodi, smartness. And then third, call it toneyarva in the translate,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.160
 I said, who are keen, interesting on the learning and practicing dharma, keen,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.720
 interesting. Not just say, kind of like, oh, I'm trying, I'm going to think this, that,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.320
 but very strong determination. Lodi, all the life stories of the ancient, those great practitioners

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.320
.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:17:00.240
 How really they also explore their loyalty, their dedication, their determination, their courage,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:10.240
 their commitment, their patience, how they did. All those great masters we read in the books

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:19.360
 and life stories, they not come as great masters. They become as great masters because of the

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:28.880
 pursuing their keen interest of that, never give up that, never left it. Continue to maintain and

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:38.400
 hold, stay on the truck, trucks, not just a one day show, two day shows, or just testing that.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:46.400
 But really maintaining and the loyalty, loyalty to the teaching, loyalty to dharma,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:55.840
 and loyalty to the teacher, and loyalty to the lineage. This means, again, it's not something

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:03.680
 that we are dragging ourselves, forcing ourselves. The generally Buddha teaching, all is loving

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:18.160
 kindness, compassion, respect and appreciation, calm and peaceful, and as well as it's deceiving

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.450
 and giving. It's not some kind of trap or something, or we have to be loyalty, we have to be strong

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:24.720
.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:31.280
 It's not the tormented. It's not something that is totally kind of desperate situation.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:39.760
 When we keep up this, it opens our heart and mind. Our courage and commitment and

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:45.600
 patient growth, deepness, all negativities and obscurations are really going away.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:54.080
 Going away with the more sunlight, the sunlight and our horizon of the ego-clinging mountains

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:02.240
 are more now beginning to see. Coming to shine, and that is what the teaching said. So therefore,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.200
 those are the simple, condensed qualifications of the students, practitioners.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:16.240
 Now, when you have that student, or when you have to meet the teacher, when you have to qualify the

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.920
 teacher, and when you begin to practice this, what great master in teaching always said.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:30.000
 Generally, what in teaching is that you can read in the words of my perfect teachers. First of all,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.840
 the student should be be expert to searching the perfect teachers. And those are all we went

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:45.520
 through, in a way, all the qualifications. Once you regard the qualifications of your teachers, be

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:55.520
 expert with the contract with the teachers. Be expert. That is important. Now we have to keep the

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:04.320
 relationships, connection with the teacher. As I said earlier, or in Buddhism, it's not short time,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:13.840
 but it's long time until we reach enlightenment, by the hood. So we keep that connection. Therefore

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:13.840
,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:22.720
 be expert. Contact with the teacher. Again, that is teaching. So many teachings in the Buddha

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.640
 teaching mentioned this, always really mentioned. What in the suttas called "dungvok" or "suttas".

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.440
 And there, Buddha said, there's four different intentions you should contact with the teachers.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:44.960
 Four intention ways. Four intention that students or practitioners, we should see the teacher

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:02.450
 as expert doctor, M.D. M.D. Our self, we should see as patients, patients. And you should see dh

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.360
arma

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:15.840
 as a medicine. Dharma as medicines. Practicing dharma as taking medicine to remove the sickness.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:23.840
 So those are by great by gracious teacher, Buddha, you should contact the teacher

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:33.040
 with four different intentions. Those four different intentions. Sure. Then in that teaching said,

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.440
 teachers should see as warriors. When they're going into the difficult jungles or the

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:49.440
 difficult passages, a warrior will protect us. That's a protractor that will go through those

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:58.640
 passages. And we should see teachers as sellers, captains, stills, those qualified teachers.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.000
 And then, of course, each time intention, those are one after another, I won't go over that,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.680
 but you can connect to that. So that means we should see, for example, a warrior, we should see

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.640
 ourself as travelers. Travelers. So forth. I mean, with those intentions there.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:29.460
 And then what the great master, M.D. M.D., one who taught, I mean, is a very famous teaching, 37

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.320
 practice of the Bodhisattvas.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:45.440
 In that teaching, what he said, he said, home, I contract, home, I contract, that means referring

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:53.760
 to this teacher. Qualified teacher, when I contract, it will demolish or reduce my negativities

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:03.120
 and increasing the old good qualities. What that means? Good qualities. In Buddhism,

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.440
 good qualities are the qualities of the moralities, qualities of the concentrations,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:19.040
 qualities of the wisdoms, or qualities of the knowledge of the Buddha's teachings,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.880
 and the qualities of the realization, long ago, talk with you, long ago, talk with you in it.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:34.560
 Now, coming as like waxing moons, increase them, that spiritual friend, we should,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:46.880
 practitioners should honor as one's own body and contract. See as dear as one's own body. That is

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:54.000
 the practice of the Bodhisattvas, the great master. I mean, you know, many of you started

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.200
 that teaching, that that is. Contract like that. So this is one. And therefore, then when you

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.720
 contract,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:12.160
 what do I do? In the, often in the practice of lineages, trying to do two, three, three different

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:22.000
 ways. Contract, make connection with the material offerings, make connection with the support of

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.240
 the

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:31.040
 physical, verbally, mentally, and make offerings through the practices. Those are the three

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:40.560
 different ways to contracting and keeping the connection with the teacher. And first is material,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:48.160
 material offerings, so all the gifts, so whatever. And the second is your services,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:54.720
 helping, supporting. That teacher, we remember, you remember, is also human beings. Maybe needs

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.800
 some support, help us, not just to receive the teaching and the leave, kind of neglected as like,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.840
 like unnecessary, kind of unimportant, but also help and support to that,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:13.280
 that teachers, we and the teachers go according your capabilities or readiness. So that is the

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:13.600
 second,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:23.360
 offerings or second. Third one is the, or the best one is then practice, offering of the practices,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.400
 practice, meditation, study in the teaching, learn that, really hold the lineage teachings.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.480
 Maintain the lineage teaching. What in the teaching said, what the great masters in the

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:47.280
 teaching said, be as honey bees. Extract the honey from the flowers without hurting the flowers.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:56.960
 Be expert as honey bees. That student, so that means got all the honey in benefit, but same time

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.520
 left the beauty of the flower and the spreading of the pollens. That means teachings, the messages

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:12.960
 spreading out. Like be expert, be as honeys. Oh sorry, honey bees. That's what really said,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.760
 to contact the teachers. Contract and that you're keeping relationship, you're keeping,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.960
 or we're keeping not just you, we're keeping the our lineage, the relationship to the teacher,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:33.840
 we're keeping our legacy and the same time upholding the supreme wish of our great masters,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:43.680
 great teachers. So that is how we contract. And then here, and here I said for example,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:52.160
 here, what I said here, in particularly devoted to the root teachers. This, what means root

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.840
 teacher, this is in the Vedayana teaching, teaching but also is not just only Vedayana and

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.720
 generally,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.480
 the principal teacher, something that you're important teacher to you, something important

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.560
 for you, your growth of the knowledge in Muslims. That is called root teacher. In Vedayana teaching

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.560
,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:22.960
 root teaching, how you refer, that root teacher is one who give the empowerment and transmission,

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.560
 one he give the, or one who give not he, he or he, either can, and one who give, give the

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.720
 explanation

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:44.880
 of the teaching, one call, and one who give the instructions. So one call, that's what the teaching

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.760
 says. So means one who give the empowerment and the transmissions, one who explain the teachings,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:58.320
 and then one who give the also pit instructions or the ultimate instructions of the lineage

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.040
 teaching,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:10.080
 transferring, those are named as root teachers. So to that connect with that, and then I said,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.600
 you should contract with the teacher with respect and appreciation, and joy and devotion.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:25.120
 That you all know. That's known as devotion. Devotion is, I think, stronger than the fed,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:34.400
 or stronger and is more deeper than in it. But you have two words, tebādne mugu, two words.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:44.560
 Tebā means fed, f-a-i-t-h, I think fed. Those are fed, are what in the teaching said,

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:56.320
 the interesting fed, desiring fed, and uncheckable fed, undefeatable fed, or no return fed.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:04.160
 Those are the category that dance you develop the fed. Then when the fourth one or third one come,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:12.320
 then it become the devotions, the precious, precious richness, and connected with affections

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.880
 and really appreciations. Appreciations, not just, oh, I like this and that, but

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:26.480
 something that bounded deeper levels with appreciation, respect, and loving kindness

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:33.440
 to each other. Those are, I think, I think, devotions. So that those are what here,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:39.040
 he's only doing what he said, and it's not just him, but is that when we have that devotion,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:44.480
 when we have that connection to the teacher, we delay very loyalty connection to the teacher,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.440
 to the lineage, that is known as reach of the practitioners. Why is called the richness?

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:58.240
 Because when we are that, our, the growth of the realization is now coming up, not drying up,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:05.680
 it's lashing, as a booming, as a spring, spring is really coming up. Then it makes reach,

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:12.720
 our heart reach, realization reach, knowledge reach, experience reach, common sense reach,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.520
 and our ego clings, and all the negative emotions going down and down. We are more grounded down to

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.080
 the earth, more humble, more simple, more respectful, more appreciative, really begin to see the

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.640
 beauty

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:34.720
 of this world, learn and grow, and the importance of everyone. Those, all the bundles of knowledge,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.600
 the riches are shining in our heart and mind. That is wealth. This is not wealth of the material,

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.960
 something that we own, and we pray and hope, and then kind of lost it, and we leave. But that is,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:55.040
 this reach, according to Buddhism, this reach, we will leave this world with this reach.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:03.440
 We leave this world, not going to leave behind everything. This reach going to come with us.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:11.120
 Really, a current teaching. This will make our, our side reach, reach on the pardo.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.200
 This will make reach on the spiritual lives. This is a current, and this that, and our,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.360
 all the negative with this are decreasing, negative, negative obscurations. All the

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:32.320
 matrices are increasing. We leave that with that. Two merits are what the great mass of each other

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:41.520
 could be used as the wings of the bird. We fly with that merits. We shed away the old,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.680
 unnecessary burden of the negative emotions, lighten up, clear away those things. Really,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:55.440
 a culture. So that is what this reach is, reach is. And so maybe I'll stop here, this today here,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.600
 because I think our time that, and then I go continually like this, slowly by slowly,

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.560
 and then we through this, go this over the teachings, teachings. Thank you very much

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:12.160
 again for your participation. Thank you again, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.640
 everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Now we do, as I said, the first session we do just one

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.760
 short dedicated prayer. And then after that, we do the healing practice or the second session.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.080
 So we do short dedicated prayer. And again, this, this many of you know, and by heart,

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.520
 I think that's one word. This is in the Buddha teaching, this is the Buddha's word, this teaching,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.760
 this person when we joined is Buddha's word in, it is in the according to teaching, teaching,

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:49.280
 it is in the Lalita Vasuta Sutras, the Buddha's long life story of the Buddha's teaching, teaching

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.440
 all the, in a way, it is ultra-Bhagavati of the Buddha's. And there, I think this is the word is,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.520
 so we join this one of these fellows. By this merit, may all obtain the omniscient,

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:08.160
 may defeat the wrong drawing from the strong waves of the birth, origin, sickness, and death.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.360
 From the ocean of the samsara, may I free all beings.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.320
 Okay. Thank you, everyone. Thank your participation. Thank you.
