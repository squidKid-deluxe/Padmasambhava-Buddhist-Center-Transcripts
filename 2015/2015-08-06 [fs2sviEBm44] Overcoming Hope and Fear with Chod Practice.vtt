00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 I've already, the great Master, said here, with the realization of the Four Boneless,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.080
 Four Boneless, you all know, and we join in the Buddha's Hadna,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.020
 when you practice the Buddha's Hadna, these beautiful prayers, that Four Boneless.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.120
 And that Four Boneless taught, and that means never giving up the sentient beings.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.300
 That attitude, that thought, with the understanding of emptiness, combined target,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.200
 or with the two realization, combined target with both each other.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.800
 Simple step. There, then, you're going. There.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.280
 When you go there, now, according to the teaching, you're going there,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.380
 going there to boost up our realization.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.220
 Going there, and going to perform the ceremony to boost our realization.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:02.660
 And our, what is preventing our realization is our ego-clinging, our dualities.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.800
 Ego-clinging, duality is best, and we can go, let it detail with that.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.180
 What is known as that? That is known as hope and fears.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.420
 Ego-clinging is combination or embodiment of the hope and fear.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.820
 As long as we have the hopes or expectation, there is fears.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.060
 As long as we have fear, that means we have the hopes, hopes.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.180
 This hope and fear is, like as day and night, they're not going to go separate.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
 That is ego-clinging.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 This is called observable code, and ourselves are trapped with this, in the samsara.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.460
 We always have hoped something. Ego-hopped this.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.320
 And we always fear that what we hoped is not going to happen.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.060
 There is gross level, medium level, and self-conscious level. We have that.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.260
 Now, we're going to, going to the scary places, we're going to bring up that hope and fear.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.720
 Bring up that. And when you bring up that hope, what are you going to do?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 We are going to lack that varnish in the state of the emptiness, the tattoo, liberated in the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 tattoo status.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.300
 What the tattoo state was, what we learned, the tattoo, cutting poles, instantly liberated.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.180
 We liberated hope, we liberated fears. Hope and fear liberated.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 And really, great, relaxed, calm, and bored each other, for completion.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.220
 And so now, what we're going to do, to the scary places, we are provoking our hope and fears.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.420
 We are provoking that. You bring up.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.220
 When you go to scary places, most of the time, what our ordinary people will think,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.180
 "Hey, I like to have comfortable, comfortable practices, and peaceful practices.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.680
 I like to have nice faces there. Oh, nice sleeping there.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.920
 I don't want to be disturbed by anyone, so no animal, no animals, or nothing there.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.420
 I like to go there, and let breakfast there, and then nice sleep in there."

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.380
 And I said, "I have nice tent, I have poor bars, I have no food, those poor drinks."

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.800
 And I said, "I'm going to go, and I'm going to see beautiful stars in the air, in the blue sky, in

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.620
 the fresh air, all of them.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.660
 I'm good. This is good, but according to these two practices, that's a hope.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.320
 That is your making agenda of our ego-clinging. That will give you always hope.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.220
 That is nothing unusual. We like to have hope. That is really your light highlight.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.340
 But here, we like to transcend hope and fears.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.980
 Particularly, we like to transcend fears.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.480
 Most of the time, hope is a kind of naive. Hope is in a kind of low, utter currents.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.780
 But fear is on the surface for us. So we like to release, remove the fears.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.660
 There are fears of externalism and inner-worldly, and then mental fearness.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.700
 It's kind of always scares some fears.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.940
 As long as we have the ego-clinging, there's some degree of the fears.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.580
 We like to release that.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.420
 First, we like to bring up that, and like that moment, when it comes up,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.470
 we're going to apply our realization of the true true or the emptiness, and release them, and going

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.620
 to be in that state.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.340
 We're going to maintain that with courage and commitment and confidence.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.700
 That is the whole purpose of the practice of the true, true, going to the scale place.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.540
 And now to do this. This, here, says...
