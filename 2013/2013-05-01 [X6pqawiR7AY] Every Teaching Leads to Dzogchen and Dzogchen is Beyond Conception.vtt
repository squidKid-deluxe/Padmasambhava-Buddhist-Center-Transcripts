00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 "Every road," what's called? "Every road leads to the wrong path." Same way, every teaching leads

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.000
 to the Dzogchen, and Dzogchen is beyond the conception.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.690
 So, but every kind of code, the blues of each of those yanas, with the conception, won't get

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.000
 enlightenment, with the conception, enlightenment.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 For example, after opening, looking from Dzockebu, Dzockebu, every yana, every kind of look,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 looking to that, they have some errors, some weaknesses.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.760
 And in his proposal, three lower yanas, or three casual yanas, such as Sharapayana, Parthikvodayana

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:55.000
, Yana, these two, as known as Hinayana,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.520
 they have again some tends to hold the intangible things that exist. They didn't exactly discover

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.000
 absolute great emptiness in the religion.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And that is the, in a way, the every matter, mass, things that exist in their things.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 That we started in those shared attacks, that you learned that. And then, same time, they had also

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.000
 a relaxation holding on the state of the, such as Ahadahod.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.490
 Ahadahod is a negation status. Holding the rules as negation status, again, in the Dzockebu point

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.000
 of view, or even in Mahayana point of view, they don't have full realizations.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.760
 Negation is the full natural

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.580
 And then in Mahayana, again in Dzockeg, or when we look in Dzockeg, they have also kind of little

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.000
 more leanings of the emptiness, all kind of negation of the emptiness states, all like that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 And in the Kriyatatra, they are holding more characteristics, characteristics. And similarly, in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.000
 Mahay Yoga and Anu Yoga, they have also leanings of the more, more leanings of the visualization,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.510
 very regularization, holding different images, images with structuralist things. And Anu Yoga also

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.450
 leanings more of the channels with, again, structural qualities. Structural qualities are

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.000
 structured and structured.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.440
 According to Dzockeg point of view, that structure quality is propagated by the dualities, that won

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.910
't lead to relaxation. And what is Dzockeg, then? Dzockeg is free from structures, free from the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.000
 organizing, and also even say Dzockeg is free from the activities, free from the effort.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.340
 And that's what took you is, took you is, relaxing in the ordinary state, not doing anything. Be in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.520
 the ordinary state. For that, those reasons in Dzockeg as said, even there is no meditators, there

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.000
 is no meditators.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.980
 And there is also no destructors. No meditation, no destructors. Just be in that Dzockeg status.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.330
 And everything, when you look at it from Dzockeg point of view, all of those yanas has effort, has

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.000
 driving force.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.290
 That drive force and effort is not going to lead augmenting meanings. That's what point. But

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.520
 however, this is the meditational level. When you have that meditating, that's what you should med

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.000
itate.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.200
 But in the mundane level, in all those teachings are important. That's what the Dzockeg teaching

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.300
 always says, emphasizes on the body, for example. Even the Dzockeg teaching is self-named, named as

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.000
 body teaching.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.070
 But when you come to the meditational level, then release everything. Carefree. There's nothing to

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.000
 care. Relax in the natural. Total carefree. Freedom. Relax. Openness.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Not structure, not exactly, not exactly. Be in the natural state. So that's the one here, you see.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 All others, others are, through that effort, we're not going to hear.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.730
 Those who are, the nayanas who are structured at the end of the nayanas journey, then you have to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.000
 join to the Dzockeg, that who is then more emphasizing on the wisdom.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.820
 Then we'll get the realization of the true natures. And until that, until you discover the self-

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.710
born eagerness, you're not going to get enlightenment, no matter whatever the yana you're using that

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.000
.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.820
 And that is, again, in the Nada Dzockeg Andhra, known as the very refined liquid of the precious

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:19.000
 gold of the space section, space section of the Western Dandara.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.090
 Western Dandara, in that Dandara said, said, if a rupa is not diluted by the constructions, then

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.520
 this dharmangaya. And rupa, natural quality of the rupa is sovavakaya, since it's not caused by the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.000
 cause and conditions.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.860
 It is uncomposed as the sky. And then, again, other Dandara, Dandara, Dzockeg Dandara, known as, is

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.000
 equalized as the sky dandara.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.130
 And there, in the teaching said, as a lotus is not equipped by the mud, and similarly, the true

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:03.480
 nature of the Western mind or the Bodhic Jata, the true absolute enlightenment mind or the Bodhic J

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.000
ata is free from the duality.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.930
 Because in that nature of the absolute wisdom has no stains. For that reason, it is self-born

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.000
 essence. Essence is not propagated by anyone. It is awareness of the King.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:34.270
 King, it is uncombounded heart. This cannot be destroyed by any circumstances. There is nothing to

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.000
 be accepted, nothing to be rejected.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.020
 If you have just discovered this realization, that yogi or yogini, even they appeared as human

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:53.300
 beings, but their mind is Buddha. Their mind is Buddha, and their voice is the voice of the Buddha

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.000
 or the voice of the Brahman.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:12.880
 And the Buddha of the three times is free from conceptions, and the Buddha of the three times is

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.000
 free from consciousness, and it is self-born awareness.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:29.730
 It is the wisdom that does not come from the duality mind. And therefore, wisdom does not come from

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.000
 the mind.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:48.740
 It is the ordinary, pristine self-awareness of the Lomistic. And therefore, this ordinary nature of

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.700
 the phenomenon is the great emptiness that is ordinary nature, but does not come from the component

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.000
.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.990
 This nature of every phenomenon does not come from the phenomenon. It is natural. All phenomena

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.000
 reflect from this nature.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.520
 And again, the others of the Tantra, Yihit and Dutta, in that Tantra said, this self-awareness is

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.000
 originally inherited, originally recited qualities.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.770
 Again, same thing. Same thing is not born caused by the cause, is not developed or changed by the

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:32.000
 conditions, it is not by any effort, it is dharmakai, it is awareness.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Therefore, everybody must have the confidence to discover this nature.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.730
 And then, another Tantra, Dokit Tantra, Rakhachib Tantra. I think I am going to read it, because it

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.000
 is already translated there, and you can look to that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So, I am not struggling to translate and try to translate these titles.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.640
 Titles, Rakhachib Tantra, and this great dharmakai is free from all the heads or the extremes. It

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.000
 is a recited to everyone, but yet, everybody didn't recognize or realize this.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It is not the mind, it is not the conception, it is not ignorance, it is not deluded.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 It is the total raka, that is free from the dualities.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 It is even there, it burns many things, but nature never changed.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.650
 Everything, what you perceive, all concluded within this one single state of the nature of the mind

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.000
.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And that is what nature is.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 If you understand this unchanging college of the raka, you understand everything.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.980
 And if you see this raka is free from the duality or free from the mind, you understand that every

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.000
 phenomenon is free from the strains.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.330
 If you see raka has something, a company, something different than that, that is what you have to

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.000
 remove.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Raka is totally pervasive, it embodies everything.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 And raka is not the mind.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:32.440
 When you have that realization, you discover that every phenomenon has no basic ground than the r

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.000
aka itself.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And the unchanging dharmakaya, I'm sorry, unchanging bodhicata has never been deluded at all.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 This undeluded bodhicata is pervasive to all the beings.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 This call it essence call of enlightenment is the same call it as all the buddhas has. That's no

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 difference.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 That the self-awareness light comes from that is pervaded to everywhere.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 The pervasive light is pervading to everywhere.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Even though light and that call it is inherent to everyone, but it's naturally been hidden to them,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 to everyone.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 It is naturally hidden, naturally hidden.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.110
 And therefore, there is a kind of a hidden, like I called Mahayana Ghar, but then when you read

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.000
 there is three or four, four, or two things.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.270
 But those can be summarized by the great master Ruhusumpa, and Ruhusumpa said there's like the

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:48.000
 hidden, naturally hidden, and then hidden, two things.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So this is naturally hidden. There's nobody hidden, but it's naturally hidden that call it is.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 This net is the realization, ultimate intention, the realization of all buddhas of three times.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.520
 When you, when whoever discovered this nature, that everyone, that those person or those

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:23.000
 individuals equal to everyone and every this nature is never moved by any means to anywhere.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.950
 It's all the time. Say, whether you got the realization as a Buddha or whether you really got the

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:37.000
 realization as seven beings, nature is the same, exactly the same.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 As those others said, in these Dapnathas.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.450
 Therefore, this ordinal yuma, the natural, self-evident scalded, it is free from every focal point,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.000
 yet it is never changed, never moved from the ordinal nature.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.520
 The express energy, energy, power from that call it, the spontaneous inherent power call it, is

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:16.000
 reflecting to everywhere, as is reflecting, it is also experienced by everyone.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.890
 What do you see? We are experiencing, that is what you see. It's self-reflective and who is

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:29.000
 experiencing? The one who is reflecting, we are experiencing that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.190
 And this, this whatever self-reflective experience by one's own self, and this all the clear lumin

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:48.980
osity, signs and call it, what we all is, is appearing through means of the sculptures or their

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.000
 arisingness.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.640
 When that effort, when effort that perfectly at that time, then self-born awareness, lamp, or light

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:08.080
 of the self-born awareness, will capture the all, the object, and then subject by self-born

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:19.000
 awareness, the luminosity, and then the partition of the duality is totally collapsing or removed.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.790
 What is, you begin to experience, or what, not experience, what is, you begin to perceive and sing

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:35.000
 is then the display, any environment of the self-born awareness of the light.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.380
 And that is known as then Togal practice too. Togal practice is that. The way that experience comes

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:51.000
 from, is then come from, from where that arising is then, is arising as said so many times.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:01.810
 It is nyumma-sriva, or nyummasi, the original nature of the mind, the source of every, that display

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:07.200
, which comes, that. And that is what the Togal, and then many of you already received the Togal

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.000
 practices and the teachings generally.
