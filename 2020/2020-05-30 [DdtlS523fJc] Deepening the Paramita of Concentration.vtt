00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.890
 Again, thank you very much everyone. Thank you very dearly. It's welcome everyone. Thank you. Thank

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.280
 you very much. Again, we continue to follow the teaching of the greatest teacher,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.650
 for the Shakyamuni, as told by Jaki Duneung Rinpoche. And the Jaki Duneung Rinpoche, there are so

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 many different variety of teachings that covers all the meanings of the Nayana teachings,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:41.880
 and as well as the three cultures and poetry, and all those different things that Jaki Duneung Rin

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.640
poche told, but this time we are following as that kind of beat instruction.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.590
 The heart advice, as in the teaching said, the title, "Heart Advice for the Fourteen Ones." That's

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 why we are following that.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.410
 So, we are following this teaching, beating and kind of activating and trying to put that in our

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.920
 heart and mind so that we can practice and continually activate our practices.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.190
 And we all are practitioners. We all follow a greatest teacher, Vada Shakyamuni's teaching, and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.680
 that, as told by many great teachers, the lamas told that.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.160
 But this is always a Jaki Duneung Rinpoche teaching. It's essence of the old teaching. So, it's

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.840
 every teaching that what you receive from many great masters and teachers,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 that is really good. This teaching is going to just activate it and clarify, so that we can really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.640
 observe and kind of use to our growth and the realization of the practices.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 So, therefore, for that reason, Jaki Duneung Rinpoche's name for this heart advice. That means,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 also, this is his practice.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.460
 He practiced and meditated. He followed. It's not just that he's talking as intellectual, he can't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.760
 really understand, but he's talking as a practice, what he practiced and meditated, how we actual

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.440
ize realization.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.700
 And that same experience, realization, that knowledge that he is hearing with us, with his kindness

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.480
, his compassion, for all the living beings, those who are interested to practice.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.940
 Of the Buddha teachings, and particularly, as followed, as taught by practicing lineage, or as

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.760
 practiced by all the practicing lineage. He is a master.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 So, that is what really we're following. And now, again, in order to follow this, always, as we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.880
 heard that, and I also mentioned, and that we activated our joy in appreciation.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.320
 Joy in appreciation of our very existings, and our situation, and our circumstances, and all

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.540
 abundant that we are relieved, has thoroughly asked with beautiful things, really, not just our

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.280
 making of those same things.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.190
 Truly, you can reflect each of your times, your lives, your situation, your circumstances, for our

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.880
 situation. Truly, we should be joy in appreciation of every aspect of these lives.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 Even we have difficult troubles there, but that being the living experience, that's why we become

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 stronger, more stable, more determined, more directed, we have the goal to perform.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.630
 And that is a legacy, our own legacy. Legacy that we fulfill our own wishes, and legacy we leave

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.520
 something for the benefit of others in the sense of all living beings as both together, as both

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.880
 themselves.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.680
 So, that's why, there, for every reason, we should feel happy in the joy, appreciate it, many days.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.280
 And that teaching is so precious.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.100
 As I said the other day, lineage is so precious, teaching is so precious, situations are so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.080
 precious, circumstances are so precious.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.410
 All these situations, the brief situations, so many things, controgate with our, right in our plate

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.680
, right in our hand, this is wonderful.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 We should not miss the opportunity. Do something, take something tangible that we can take that,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.080
 not just the only legacy behind.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.030
 But take that legacy with us, when we lead this journey. So, have the legacy now, have the legacy

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.880
 with us.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.880
 And that is known as win-win. That is win-win, truly.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 And so therefore, again, bring joy, our appreciation, more graceful, greater truth, thoughts.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.740
 And with that, and then also extended with both each other. All the sentient beings, that is

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.480
 compassion, loving kindness, and understanding knowledge.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.860
 You are really practicing, you are taught, intentional, extended to all living beings, and both

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.680
 each other, that's it, and both each other, we all know, we heard so many times, both each other.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.360
 And then, purely realization of the teachings. That was all we extended. With this, then we

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.680
 followed this teaching.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.970
 In this teaching, we went many kind of varieties of the second teachings that were, as the Buddha

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.480
 taught, post for noble truth teachings.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 And one after another, we went, we convinced, highlighted, targeted, we went one after another.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 We came to the rafudda, we discussed the foreign associations, then we kept the rafudda.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.280
 Then we discussed about the meaning of rafudda, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.000
 Those are also there, we can kind of highlight, kind of clarifications with each other, kind of to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.280
 re-pray our memories and knowledge that we learn from our great master.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.280
 So, all the form of the books that we learned, we went there.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.910
 And then we went to both each other, and both each other has also got a numerous way to divide

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.080
 individuals, but then summarize into two both each other.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.100
 And which is, then, related to the both each other, and absolute to the both each other, absolute

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.080
 to the both each other, relative to the both each other.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.020
 Relative to the both each other, can be divided into two, reaching both each other, actualizing

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.080
 both each other.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.880
 And that's what really we did, reaching both each other, and actualizing both each other.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.280
 And we went, reaching both each other is, then, have a sincerely wish, with compassion, longing,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.880
 kind of thought,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.880
 for all living beings, and like to benefit for all the sentient beings, as much as they can.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.880
 They follow the footsteps of the Buddha, and both of you settle.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.810
 So really we have that, until you're told, very strongly, kind of, very beautifully developed in

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.880
 the heart and the mind.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 And then, because of that, we developed it, re-troghed it up, both each other's vows.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 Those are the little, and we also mentioned them, taking vows from the both each other.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.690
 Once the re-troghed the vows from both each other, well, you have the siddling, call it a frick, s

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.680
iddling call it of the, the wishing both each other.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.080
 Then, perhaps, the wishing both each other, with the mentally exercised, and those are the poor,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.680
 boundless, and the tungling practices.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.470
 Those are our vows. When those are siddling in our heart, mind, then we apply them to the actions

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.480
 by the physical, and as well as verbally helping.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.990
 And those are all summarized into six paramatas. Six paramatas, we're going to actualize the way,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.480
 actualizing both each other's.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.940
 Actualizing both the other can also summarize into three extraordinary training practices, which we

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:51.130
 discussed about the morality training practices, concentrated training practices, and the versatile

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.280
 training practices.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:08:01.280
 Those are a little bit, is known as lapa-song, or lapa-song, three extraordinary training practices

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.080
, and morality practices, concentration practices, and the versatile practice.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.770
 That is a condensed meaning of the six paramatas, six paramatas, particularly in the Mahayana

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.080
 teachings, Mahayana teachings.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.440
 And, of course, this three extraordinary teaching practices is generated entirely by the teachings

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.080
 there, but in Mahayana, that highlights the six paramatas practices, and that is.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.800
 And now, with that, kind of, with the, let, let we leverage that three extraordinary training

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.080
 practices, it is a six paramata practice.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:43.950
 Then we learned the six paramata practices of one after another, those, such as generous paramata

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.080
 practices, morality paramata practices,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:54.590
 morality paramata practices, and patient paramata practices, and joyful effort, joyful effort to

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:00.080
 the virtuous paramata practices, those we learned one after another.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:08.330
 And now, it's a pit paramata practice, pit paramata, so how, how this, first, again, the generous

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:15.080
 paramata practices, second is the morality paramata practices, third is patient paramata practices,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:26.080
 fourth is joyful effort to the virtuous paramata practices, those are the four paramata we learned.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:34.080
 Among the four paramatas, now we have to go two paramatas, that will make the six paramatas.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.980
 Paramatas, in a paramata, is a Sanskrit word, transcendental, I think it's translated into English,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.080
 and in the way it's called 'parathosimba'.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:54.410
 Actually, the true paramata is beyond the dualities, beyond the duality of the subject, object, and

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.080
 activities.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:03.080
 That is absolute paramata, then that is inability to get that next paramata.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.970
 By the paramata, paramata is a Sanskrit word, in the Tibetan parathosimba, in the English

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.080
 translated as transcendental, but it's also mean going other show.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:24.080
 The other show of the dualities, duality or grasping, that is the other show.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.030
 So we need to have no grasping and cling into the subject and object of the equal paramata and

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.080
 activity, that is become the really, really paramatas.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:44.080
 So that is, the goal of the equal paramata is, is, such as, is that okay?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:11:05.080
 Okay, the goal of the equal paramata is beyond dualities, that is really that.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:14.080
 As that means, beyond the dualities means also absolute truth, absolute truth. So is that.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.080
 So that is what we've been discussing.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:24.080
 Among those five, six paramatas, we discussed, kind of quite detailed, but highlight the target,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.080
 the essential meaning of those possible paramatas.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.080
 Today, I'm going to show again, the picked paramatas, a little bit.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.080
 And a picked paramata, I went last time too, that week.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.450
 And of course, generally you all know. It's not something that, again, I'm talking that you don't

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.080
 know or anything like that.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.320
 You're already very knowledgeable in the teachings of the Buddha Dharma and the study and the

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.080
 scholars and all those, really, I'm sure you're all that.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.520
 So, but I'm just again into refreshing that somebody, my understanding, my knowledge, that

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.080
 contributing to all of us to kind of additionally,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:10.080
 if somebody is benefiting or to clarification of yours and our practices.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080
 So that is what we're doing.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.080
 Now, we need to pick the paramata.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.920
 Picked paramata is beyond paramatas or in Nietzsche, I think, commonly translated as concentration

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.080
 paramatas.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:32.800
 As I said the other day, the first three paramatas, that means, generous paramata and morality

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:40.080
 paramata, patient paramata, is mainly on the body and the speeches.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.080
 Mainly external activities of our physicals.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:52.080
 And your effort for the virtuous paramata is support of all paramatas.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:01.080
 Now this concentration paramata and versatile paramata is more connected with mental states.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:08.080
 To mine, actually what we have, we have three things in every individual.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.470
 Even there's many divisions, many explanations, it's true, there's also many things to explain, but

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.080
 to summarize all things what we have.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.080
 Such as a symbol of "I" or symbol of "me".

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.080
 What do we have? Our body, our verbal, and our mind.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:35.080
 That three, it's a simple way to explain that we can say "I am" or "you are".

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.080
 That can't be replicated.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.080
 So what we have? That is three.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:49.080
 So this fourth three paramata is more related with physical, verbal activities.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.080
 Of course, again, all is vast upon the mind.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 Because all that is really the kind of manipulative or directing, accelerating by the mind.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:11.080
 But really comes more kind of outreaching. Generally it's more outreaching with our good heart or

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.080
 good body.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:18.080
 Morality is more outreaching, more where we behave ourselves.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.920
 Where we communicate with others, where we will be residing or be in the community, in the

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.080
 societies.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.080
 That is more morality, more gentle, more peaceful.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.080
 More peaceful, more calm, more soothing.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.080
 That is really the morality. More nice and cool qualities.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.080
 That is morality.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.080
 Passion is also more with that.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.080
 Where we are standing in the community, where we are in the group,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:58.080
 how we are going to maintain our coolness and our moralities, our body together.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.080
 That is regularly guidelines for really meaning to how to behave.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.080
 How we go to the different challenges in our life.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:15.080
 We go through, life is like turning beds, one up another is turning.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.080
 Every day is in a way slightly different beds.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.080
 Maybe it's one chapter, but different beds.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080
 And then within life there are so many chapters, one up another.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:33.080
 So how we should behave, how we should stand and adapt to every different change in movement.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.080
 So that is the patience.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.080
 Patience is like my bones, ours.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.080
 How we stand is strong, firm, all the good things we go through.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 Whether it's good, whether it's bad, whether it's kind of whatever it is.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.080
 Remain strong, strong, solid and stable, keeping the principle,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.080
 our identity of the body together or the body together.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.080
 That is the patience.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 And your effort is as in the teaching manual, it is supportive.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 Your effort to the virtues.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.080
 Again you remember how very good teacher of the Gautakshat community

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.080
 and as well as the world great master explained.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.080
 Your effort is not just your effort to any things.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.080
 Your effort to the virtues, to dharma.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080
 That is your effort.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.080
 And we have your effort for our regular activity, Monday activities.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.080
 That is maybe in samsara we call it your effort.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.080
 But yet it is according to dharma.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080
 It's leading us.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080
 It's distracting us.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.080
 For our beautiful goal or performance of both each other.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.080
 Good practitioner, what is the most important in life?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.080
 To fulfill the goal of both each other is two times more important

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.080
 than the goal of duality and negative emotion portfolio.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.080
 That is, that is creation of samsara activities.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.080
 More duality, more publication of negative emotions,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.080
 more endless of traps that we create that we cannot really eat.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.080
 Samsara or come out of that.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.080
 A joyful effort for the virtues of dharma.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.080
 That is the joyful effort of the worries of the Bodhisattvas.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.080
 Bodhisattvas.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.080
 That is one joyful effort.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.080
 So therefore it is supported to all the parameters.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.080
 Then now that is what we've been discussing.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.080
 Now, today we go again, I went through a big little bit of all this last time too.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.080
 And again, of course, you all know that.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.080
 Now we go to the fifth parameter.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080
 Fifth parameter is beyond.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.080
 And it's a way to go to something, something that is part of the samsara.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.080
 And the samsara that is lion parameters.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:10.080
 And in the English, I think that's translated as concentration parameters.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.080
 So now it's completely kind of connecting it up to the mind.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.080
 Mind.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.080
 It's more mind, mind.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.080
 And if we think of this samsara situation in samsara,

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.080
 how we act, generally, hardly, hardly,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.080
 normally sensitive beings or the human beings

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.080
 never take about the mind.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.080
 Normal.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.080
 Of course, this time there is more kind of movement called mindfulness.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080
 It's coming.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.080
 That is more and more mind.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080
 It's coming.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.080
 Some awareness of the mind.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.080
 But before that, it's always out, out, out.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.080
 Hardly really to think of the mind.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:59.080
 But mind is behind the scene of every of our activities.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:07.080
 Mind is the engine of our body, our verbal, our communications.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:15.080
 Everything that we do, it all manipulates, starts from this mind.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:23.080
 So therefore, this concentration is directly dealing with mind.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.080
 When we don't have the exact understanding of the mind, mind,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.080
 no matter how much we do, the generosity, morality,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.080
 moral occupation, it's all kind of almost like surface.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080
 Surface.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.080
 But when we have the kind of really like strength and power

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.080
 over our own mind, then according to the teaching,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.080
 according to all the great masters, the beauty will come.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.080
 True beauty of us shines so beautifully.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.080
 When we have good concentrations, our generous parabola

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:06.080
 will become more beautiful, more bright, more shiny, more effective.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:13.080
 Same time, morality parabolas, as well as patient parabolas.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080
 Parabolas.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.080
 That's how we read the power and the beauty of the mind.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 Because mind controls everything.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.080
 For that reason, Great Master Chantideva says,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:36.080
 when we are always as like, when we are always distracted,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:43.080
 distracted, we are, when we are always distracted by mind,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:53.080
 we are always in the jaw of the emotions, jaw, J-A-W-A, I think.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.080
 J of the emotion.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.080
 Any time, any moment can bite.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:03.080
 We are in the mouth of the emotions when we are distracted.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.080
 That means our mind has no control.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:16.080
 Mind is making all the troubles, psychological troubles, mental troubles.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.080
 And then when that happens, it also affects our channels, our nervous system.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:27.080
 All that, our whole environment of the brain, brain or the mental is really,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.080
 all become shaky, shaky.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.080
 When mind is strong and calm and peaceful,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.080
 then everything begins to settle calm and peaceful.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.080
 Therefore, this concentration of Parabola is so important.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.080
 So important because it deals directly to the mind.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080
 Now with that understanding,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.080
 then Great Teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni taught extensively teachings

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080
 about concentration, about mind.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.080
 And how to put that practice now?

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 Practice.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.080
 That is then, we call to now, concentration.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.080
 And concentration is, again,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.080
 Dhyana is a Sanskrit word indicated as concentration.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.080
 So that means, when you heard concentration in India,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.080
 I think, you know better than me, but concentration means not skated mind.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 Not just all, all the mind is concentrated.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.080
 Further that also indicating, I will put more that our mind is skated.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.080
 Never stays at the places where it can be.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.080
 It's always wandering, always distracted.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.080
 Distracted by external, all those objects,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.080
 mainly known as the five sensorial place of objects,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.080
 is really distracted all the time.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:02.080
 Time. So it's just always distracted, always wandering and roaming.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.080
 Concentration means all that our brain can't forget.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.080
 That means all the mind, whatever that's respecting the mind,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.080
 is coming back to home.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.080
 Home, sweet home is coming back.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.080
 That is, I think, Indian word concentrate too.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.080
 Dhyana means same thing.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.080
 And what is the teaching said?

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.080
 Maintaining mind in one point, it is all natural status.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:40.080
 That is the meaning or the identity of the concentrators is going to maintain.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.080
 Maintaining, and also in the teaching said,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:50.080
 maintaining one point of mind to the virtues or the dharma.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.080
 Now, so that means not one point with negative emotions.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.080
 Maintaining, but to the virtues or the dharma.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 Gave up sorrow, in it a bit, gave up sorrow.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.080
 Gave up sorrow means the virtues.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.080
 It's maintaining one point of mind, relaxing and calming.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.080
 It's calm and a relaxment.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.080
 Where you concentrate is also not forceful, or so tight.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.080
 Calmly, peaceful.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.080
 Shival ji, deva, neva.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080
 Gave up sorrow.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080
 Si ji, deva.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.080
 Shival neva, in the teaching said.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:35.080
 And one point of mind will be peaceful, relaxing to the virtues.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.080
 That is the concentrators.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.080
 So that is identity of the concentrators.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.080
 Now, talking about, again, the benefit of this concentrator.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.080
 Again, same thing as we went the first four parameters.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.080
 Those are 'alai' and the 'vat'.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:04.080
 First one is, it was avoided, it is opposite by activating concentrators.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:17.080
 And then it will bring realization of the emptiness.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.080
 And then it will fulfill the wishes.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:30.080
 And then it will lead and help to its own connection of the teachings.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.080
 Those are the four we went one after another.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:42.080
 Generous parameters, morality parameters, patient parameters,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.080
 joint effort parameters.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.080
 Again, I will go over that, let's highlight it with that.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:55.080
 This power, force it in well, purify or remove the opposite of the concentrators.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.080
 So when you have the concentrator, what is the opposite of the concentrator?

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.080
 It is destructions.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.080
 By having a good concentrator, immediately it will remove the destructions.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.080
 Destructions, that will clear the way.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.080
 And when your mind is more calm and peaceful, peaceful, what it will bring?

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.080
 It will bring realization of the emptiness.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:27.080
 Or it will bring the wisdom, the inborn wisdom, the shy, beautiful.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.080
 And we therefore that in action, what?

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.080
 Then with concentration, it will fulfill the wishes.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.080
 Wishes of ourselves, wishes of others.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.080
 Honest, so it will fulfill that wishes.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.080
 Then, but because of the good examatory and your benefit,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.080
 it will, all those who are associated with us or with you,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:58.080
 it will aspire to designate their connections to the three realizations,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.080
 or three enlifements.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.080
 Those are the enlightenment of the ahada, particular Buddha,

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.080
 and bodhisattva of the Buddha, it will connect them.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.080
 Those are in the teaching set.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:17.080
 So those are the four activities, four benefits, four activities of the Buddha.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.080
 Now, once you go, that is the division of that.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.080
 And now we go over, again, we are then in a division now,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:33.080
 of the division of the Dayan Paramata, is it can be summarized into three.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.080
 Those are known as general concentrations, or basic concentrations.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.080
 Concentration and understanding of the clearly distant meanings

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.080
 of the dharma or the phenomenons.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.080
 And the concentration that we are pleased with the Buddhas.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.080
 So those are the three concentrations.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:02.080
 Again, those three are, first are basic general concentrations,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.080
 or the beginner concentrations.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:10.080
 And the second is the concentration that clearly understand

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.080
 the distinctly meaning of the phenomena of all the knowledge.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:24.080
 And the third is concentration that will please the enlightenings of the Buddhas.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:30.080
 Those are the three concentrations, three concentrations.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.080
 Now, to develop the concentrations, what do we have to do?

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.080
 We have to avoid the distractions.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080
 Distractions.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.080
 And that is distractions.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.080
 And if we have the distractions, then we are always, as Chandideva said,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.080
 we are always on the jaw of the negative immersions.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.080
 So we should be, we should have no distractions.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.080
 No distraction, please, but what the teaching said, we should have no distractions

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.080
 from the distraction sources that will distract us.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.080
 So that means the distraction source of the physical,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 the distraction source of the mental, where we can.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.080
 And that, too, is then what the teaching said.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:33.080
 It is to actualize those two, kind of, two distractions.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.080
 Then what we have to do? We have to do two hermitages.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:44.080
 Or in other words, maybe instead a hermitage, two solitude.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.080
 Solitude of the physical, solitude of the mental.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080
 Mental solitude.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.080
 Or exhalations, maybe in other words.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.080
 This time is kind of like what we have normally now, our exhalation.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.080
 In a way, as I said the other day, is it a retreat?

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.080
 Is it a true retreat in a way?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.080
 External circumstances, allowing us like retreats.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.080
 But then, of course, we have to do in the teachings,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.080
 then you have to do exhalation of the mental activities too.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.080
 Then there is meaningful retreat.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.080
 Exhalation of the external activities,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:31.080
 or exhalations of the external activities

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.080
 and exhalations of the inner mental activities,

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.080
 then we become calm and peaceful.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.080
 In order to develop those, in any teaching said,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.080
 the great master Kamala Sharap,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.080
 who is the foremost disciple of the great,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.080
 humbling master of the Tibetan Buddhism,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.080
 Shenta Bhakta, Kamala Sharap.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.080
 I am sure in the neighborhood you heard,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.080
 because this is only the Dalai Lama,

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:07.080
 offering to give the teachings of the Kamala Sharas.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.080
 He wrote three meditation books,

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.080
 or the gradual meditation techniques of the post,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
 second and third.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.080
 He gave three different teachings.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.080
 As Rakhur's divide came to some days, he gave.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:31.080
 He came to Tibet to represent the Mahaprabhu in the run, in Tibet.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.080
 And because they had some difficulties and disturbances

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.080
 of the different way to pursue the practice and meditation of the Buddha Dharmas,

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.080
 that come from China, that come from India.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.080
 So they had some distractions.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.080
 But that was predicted by the great Master Chantalakita,

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.080
 before he entered Mahaprabhu in the run.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.080
 He said, what Chantalakita said,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.080
 in the Tibetan country they will not have tabulus,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080
 or they will not have the tabulus of the disturbance of the Buddhism

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.080
 by the different faiths, but within the Buddhism

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.080
 there is some disturbance will come.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.080
 When that comes, my disciple Kamala Sharas,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.080
 you must invite him to help,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.080
 to solve and settle that in peaceful manners.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.080
 And when the great Master Chantalakita said that,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.080
 and then came and asked, you think he will come?

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.080
 Come.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.080
 And Master Chantalakita said, yes, he will come.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.080
 That is his commitment to each other, me and him,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.080
 as a student and teacher's commitment.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.080
 But also I will leave the right letter, we left the letter.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.080
 In the preacher, the very king needed you to come in Tibet,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.080
 you have to come, as his invitation and help him.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.080
 He left the letter, as he left the letter,

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.080
 and he surely sent a difficult king.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.080
 And the king invited the great Master Kamala Sharas,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.080
 and then he solved those problems,

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.080
 those beautiful stories and his stories,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.080
 and I am sure you know that, I am not going to go over those things.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:25.080
 But anyway, he wrote those three practices,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.080
 how to pursue the practices of the meditation practices.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.080
 But as of course, by the King Chasondebi,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.080
 this Kamala Sharas wrote three books.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.080
 Those are known as the graduation meditation techniques

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.080
 of the beginning, and the same title, second,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.080
 and the same title part, three books he wrote.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.080
 In the middle book, the second book, the middle book,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.080
 what great Master Kamala Sharas said?

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.080
 He said, "When you meditate, you have good conditions,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:08.080
 good conditions that will help to perform good meditation or good practices."

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.080
 So this follow, what I am going to list,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:18.080
 is the really good conditions, good support for meditation.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.080
 Meditation, how many meditations in that generally?

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.080
 There is Shama meditation and Vibhachana meditations.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:33.080
 These two are the basic foundation of the meditation.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:38.080
 Shama meditation is concentration meditation,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.080
 what we discussed, concentration meditation,

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.080
 and that will bring one more gesture in peace form.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.080
 Shama meditation, Vibhachana meditation will understand

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.080
 the perfect meaning of the true nature of both subject and objects.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.080
 Both subject and objects.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.080
 Exhale, that means exactly as emptiness realization.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.080
 Contramplicated realization of the emptiness

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.080
 will bring by this, not intellectually talking.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.080
 It will bring that realization.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.080
 That is what the daily teaching said there.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.080
 So now this is what I am going to follow.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.080
 That teaching said what?

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 Teaching said, "I will list that, list that, and then we go again."

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.080
 As I am here, I am talking slowly and quite poorly,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.080
 according to my capabilities, so that we can understand that

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.080
 because we don't have luck or anything.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.080
 We are all in our different places.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.080
 So therefore, I am taking time and also I think in a way

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.080
 it will help a little bit clarification where you are understanding

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.080
 or at least a little bit reminding of those memories

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.080
 or not books or even books.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.080
 So really that is my intention and that means all we are in a way

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.080
 studying and contemplating.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.080
 Then we can put into practice.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080
 Practice and meditation.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.080
 So those are the way I am explaining, so I am not rushing that.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.080
 Therefore, I go again, those lists again.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.080
 This is false.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.080
 One great Master Kamala Chala said,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:22.080
 first is have the favorable places, favorable places.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.080
 That is number one.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 Second is, see, less desire.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.080
 Doba Chona in a little bit, less desire.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:42.080
 Third, Choshiba, more content, contentment, content.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:51.080
 Fourth is, is more ethics or the moralities.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.080
 Moralities.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:59.080
 And fifth is, is less activities.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:08.080
 And sixth is, less thoughts, less conceptions, less conceptions.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.080
 Those are the positive group of the support of the meditations.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.080
 Post meditation, yes, support or even in tea, isn't it?

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080
 The cause.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.080
 There are favorable conditions, favorable cause

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.080
 to activate good concentration, good meditation, good practice.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.080
 Good practices.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.080
 That poor.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080
 And that is one.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.080
 Post is placed in the favorable places.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.080
 The favorable place, when you have seen favorable places,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.080
 is then less physical distractions.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.080
 Destructions.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.080
 Those are favorable places, are explained, again,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:58.080
 as a Greek teacher, Buddha Chaka, told, and that clarified, by the material.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.080
 Material.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.080
 Future Buddha material is teaching known as doddity,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.080
 superelegara, or supereornament.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:14.080
 In that teaching said, those wise person like to get practice,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.080
 like the practices, post qualification of the practice,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.080
 or, sorry, post, go to the hermitage.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.080
 That's it.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.080
 If the wise like to practice, go to the hermitage.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.080
 Hermitage.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.080
 Now, once the qualification hermitage, like this in the teaching said,

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.080
 qualification of the hermitage is,

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.080
 there is five qualifications of the hermitage.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.080
 First one is easy to get necessary community things.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.080
 Easy to gather that.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.080
 That means our food, our kind of necessary things

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.080
 during the teaching is a little easy to get.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.080
 That is first quality of the hermitage.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.080
 Easy to get.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.080
 Second is the area is excellent.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.080
 So the area is excellent.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080
 What does that mean?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 There is not kind of like all the different wars are going.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.080
 There is the kind of pipelines are going.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.080
 There is so many robberies and gangsters that are trying that and that.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:17.080
 And all as well as many kind of wives and greasers are roaming in the distance.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080
 So there is not all of those things.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.080
 That's called the excellent areas.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.080
 So that's the second quality of the hermitage.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:32.080
 Third quality of the hermitage is beautiful space.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.080
 Beautiful places where you stay.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080
 What that means?

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.080
 Because beautiful space, there is nothing.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.080
 When you stay there a little longer time,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.080
 there is not going to develop related sickness and disease for the elements,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.080
 from the art, from the water or from the areas.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.080
 It's kind of clean, calm, peaceful.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.080
 Nice areas, nice places.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.080
 So they are not going to get sicknesses.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.080
 Sicknesses.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.080
 And then fourth one.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.080
 I think fourth one, right?

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080
 Fourth one.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:12.080
 Fourth one is then excellent print.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.080
 Excellent print.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.080
 So that means the area, the humidity, the area,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.080
 there is also your friends, spiritual friends.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.080
 You have similar interests, similar practices, similar meditators,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.080
 similar desires.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.080
 So our conduct is kind of like same.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.080
 Our area is the same.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.080
 Our philosophy is kind of the same.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.080
 So it's very harmonizing places.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.080
 That is fourth quality of the hermitage.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.080
 And the fifth quality of the hermitage is then,

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.080
 is it called the area?

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.080
 Area is good.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080
 It's the area.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.080
 It's quite good.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.080
 Again, easy to get.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.080
 Common and necessary when you need necessary things.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080
 Easy to get.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.080
 At the same time, there is less destruction during the daytime,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.080
 noise and all these things.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.080
 In also nighttime, there is no kind of robbery again in the nighttime activity.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.080
 So daytime, there is less, more quietly peaceful.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.080
 Night, say, is also quietly peaceful.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:25.080
 Those are known as pit garland of the area or the hermitage.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.080
 That is known as the paver river place.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.080
 That is the positive condition.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:39.080
 Positive course or positive quality conditions of the truth

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.080
 have developed good meditation or good meaningful practices.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:50.080
 Second is then what Kamala Khyala's teaching said.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.080
 Less desires.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.080
 So that means what?

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.080
 In a Greek teacher, Buddha Khyala's teaching said,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.080
 follow the Middle thought.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.080
 Middle thought, not the extreme of the luxuries,

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.080
 nor the extreme of the ascetics.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.080
 Ascetics.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.080
 Immediately, whatever you have,

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.080
 that's the kind of feel there.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.080
 There are not too many desires in this one, that, this one.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.080
 One, you have one thing, then the second, the third.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.080
 It just goes on and on.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.080
 Whatever you have, feel happy with that.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.080
 That is a less desire, not criving.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.080
 Craving, all the time, different things.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.080
 If we have that, that will make our mind more calm and peaceful too,

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.080
 as well, very happy.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:49.080
 Then, third one is the contaminant.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.080
 Commandment means whatever you have, you will be happy.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.080
 Appreciate.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.080
 We are one in the Buddha's teaching said.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:05.080
 We are more full of the appreciation than we are like the material.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:10.080
 Many times, we have the material, but we don't have appreciation.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:17.080
 And we will have more, less appreciation, more craving, all the time.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.080
 Craving mind is powerful, better.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.080
 No matter how much you have in the teaching said,

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.080
 you have, you sit forward.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.080
 But when you have the containment, whatever you have, feel rich.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.080
 Containment is more rich.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.080
 For that reason, great Master Nagarjuna said in his letter to his friends,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:44.080
 "Among all the wealth, the containment is the supreme wealth."

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.080
 Containment, the containment is the supreme wealth.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.080
 For that, that's what the great teacher Buddha said.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.080
 See, that's what Nagarjuna said.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080
 That's what Buddha said.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.080
 Therefore, my dear friend, he should have more containment.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.080
 We wrote this letter to his friends.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.080
 That's what Nagarjuna said.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.080
 It's not just Nagarjuna said that Buddha said,

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:13.080
 "When we are content, we are more calm, more relaxed, not craving all the time."

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.080
 All the time.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.080
 A kind of great mind, a great ego, has not enough.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.080
 We know that.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.080
 And that would make more mind distracted and less less.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.080
 And then mind becomes more excited.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.080
 Anxiety and all the stress for all those things, really,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:37.080
 numbers of problems are all coming because more greedy and less content.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.080
 So therefore, great Master Kamachara said that.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.080
 So that is my talk for today.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.080
 And then, of course, we will continue to go on this, slowly by slowly.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.080
 And so thank you, okay.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.080
 And that is what you will recall.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080
 Thank you.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.080
 And then, as I said, this time, as we did last time, healing ritual.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.080
 But this is still healing ritual.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080
 We can delegate it.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.080
 Marry it for all the really healing purposes and all that.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:12.080
 So we will go to this as, I think, an announcement in the Dachydali Bullet.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.080
 That all that, and every week we do three weeks, three days.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.080
 Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.080
 But our schedule will be the same as like 3, start at 3.30, all that.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:29.080
 And then each time, I will give also the board a half an hour to talk something.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080
 And then we practice.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.080
 And particularly with Samsala Dawa, it is very beautiful, really like a special month.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.080
 And so we do the practicing.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.080
 I remember a great teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni, on old Buddha's morning sattva.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:49.080
 He celebrated the practice and dedicated that merit for all the beings, to everyone.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.080
 So that's what really we do.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.080
 Okay.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.080
 So thank you very much again for attending and for participating.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.080
 And thank you very much for coming.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.080
 Thank you.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.080
 Thank you.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:04.080
 Okay.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.080
 And now we won't do the meditation as we did for the last time we did meditation.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.080
 And now we go straight to the practice of that.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.080
 So now we begin again with the seven-line prayer one time.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.080
 And then leading the prayers.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:23.080
 And then we go to the new version of the Buddha Sattva.
