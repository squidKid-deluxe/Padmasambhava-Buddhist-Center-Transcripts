00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080
 Hello and welcome. Good morning everyone. Again, we'll strengthen our video more in Dzogchen

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.280
 and appreciation and a little bit of vastness, motivation of the bodhicitta and then perfect,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.120
 high-perfect motivation for realization and meditation. That means we're activating those

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:35.400
 qualities. We call it as the Dzogchen, vastness, motivation, vastness, motivation of the bodhicitta

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.920
 and then high-perfect status as we went the other day and many of you know already that.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.240
 So, five parts of stabilization. And then now, this Heart Sutra. Generally, what the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:57.320
 difference between Heart Sutra and Dzogchen teachings. Oh, Mahamudra teachings. Meditation

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 or the meditation level, there's no difference. All meaning of the Heart Sutra and the Pandyakwaram

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.120
ata,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.480
 Dzogchen teaching, Mahamudra, Madhyamukha and then in Tibetan Buddhism, also known as Jyusi,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:24.760
 purification practices and our two practices, all are synonyms. All these practices are discussing

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 and explaining about the nature of the mind, nature of everything. Everything. Nature of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.520
 everything. Nature has no difference. Whatever it is, there's no really difference at all.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.760
 What makes difference is a display. That display is different. That is because it's changing,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 moving, reflecting, upcoming different things. So, it's changing. Nature remains the same. There's

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 no difference. So therefore, Pandyakwaramata and Dzogchen teachings are the same. What is all the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:18.120
 difference between to explore the nature, nature of everything. The techniques are different. That

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.160
's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 what the Buddha teaching says. Vedayana has more skillful means. More skillful means. Because of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.840
 that, more advanced. And also, Vedayana practitioners are more courageous to embrace that. That

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.160
 means,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 Vedayana practitioners are not distracted by the ego clinging. And then, maybe even more,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 more kind of clay, not distracted by the traditions and that leaning, that substance. I want this,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.520
 not wanting that. That attitude, that mental area is not restricted. Fully courageous,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:14.400
 embrace, to discover and embracing and be that nature. Therefore, what is that? That also means,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.920
 for example, patient, patient paramatas. When you practice, one of the patient paramatas, when we

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.480
 divide the person, I mean, not one week. Buddha also highlight those patient paramatas into three.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:41.120
 And one of that is known as not scared with the profound meaning of the dharma. Not scared with

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.600
 the profound meaning of dharma. That means, not scared, not afraid with the meaning of the great

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:02.080
 happiness. When you scare that, then we are going to hesitate. Then we are going to hesitate. We

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.120
 are

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:11.200
 not going to cultivate it. They belong. They belong. And so, Vedayana practitioners are more

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:20.160
 courageous, more fearless to everything. We are not going to become the obedient of the ego

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.760
 clinging.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:32.240
 They are not become the asset, like service to the ego controls. They are often, often. Therefore,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.720
 sometimes people also think, "Oh, everything is mine." For example, in the Zokki teaching and as

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.880
 well as Muhammad, everything is mine. It is very scary. Everything is mine. That means nothing is

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.080
 there. They are scared. That is true. Many times happen. And then we were talking about everything

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.280
 is a dream. Everything is a magic. Again, some people say, "Oh, again, I kind of don't feel

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:09.120
 comfortable with thinking of everything as a dream. Everything is magic." And then similarly,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:18.880
 if everything is the emptiness, or I can't stand it. That means they are scared. That means in the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:30.800
 deep dawn, it is controlled by the ego. Ego, I don't want. I want. That is hope and affairs. That

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.080
 is

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:40.560
 ego. Ego serves us. Realidly, when we are embracing the nature of as it is, we are not losing. And

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.160
 that's why in the Heart of Sutra, we join. And then we go through, some of these will come. No

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.460
 gaining, no losing. Realidly level, there's nothing really changing. Only we discover where things

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.840
 are.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.640
 Where things are. So that is what the techniques are different. We are approaching. For example,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.360
 in the here, in Heart of Sutra teaching, is Mahayana teaching. It is the Pandya Parabhata teaching.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.920
 Where we explore the nature of the great, of everything, coming from the outskirts, for example,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:25.680
 Buddha said, "home is emptiness." Coming from outskirts, from the gross. That means from gross,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:34.320
 gross to the satara. Going. In the Dokki teachings, or in the Thandras, such as Mahamudra and Dokki

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:45.680
 going with the right to the target. Target. What is? Mind. Mind is emptiness. Going to. So in this

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.310
 case, for example, in Heart of Sutra, then what? We say the consciousness is emptiness. Conscious

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.400
ness is

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:04.880
 emptiness. And emptiness. And then, the consumption is emptiness. Perception is emptiness. And

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.200
 after

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:16.320
 getting everything. From the source coming out, that's what the Dokki techniques are so targeted,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:24.960
 instantly activating that. But to embrace in this Dokki teaching, then again, again,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.040
 the other Dokki practice in the Buddha teaching, Mahayana, and always in the Buddha and as well as

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.040
 all the great monks and Gurbi Muslims, they are highly capabilities, highly intelligent, highly

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:48.800
 varied. Felicitous. Felicitous. To embrace, to observe that realization. So when you have that,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.440
 then it's full. And then, target with the devotions, heart rate and commitment. Men,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:06.320
 to embrace that. Then we discover from the deepest levels, or we use it as dynamic, dynamic,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:16.240
 dynamic, to uprooting the whole grasping, cleanness, from the very source, not from gross levels.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.520
 Otherwise, we need to come, whether you use from the outskirts or from gross to the subtle,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.960
 or from subtle to the gross, the nature is the same. There's no difference at all. It's all the

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:40.240
 same. Same thing. For that reason, every teaching says Pandya Paramata, Mademaka, Mahamadara,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:48.800
 and Dokki teaching, all the same. In practice, when you practice and meditate, it is the same.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.720
 There's no different compartment for the Pandya Paramata. In mind, there's no different compartment

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:04.160
 for the practitioners of the Pandya Paramata, or Mademaka, or Mahamadara, or Dokki, it's the same

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:13.280
 nature of the mind. Or same mind, same nature of the mind, discover that nature. So therefore,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.480
 this Heart Sutra is Dokki teaching. That is Dokki teaching. It's teaching on the nature of

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.200
 everything.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:31.360
 It's also this Heart Sutra is only our teaching, exactly only our way things are, exactly where

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:41.440
 things are. It's not overstated, it's not understated, it's way as is, simple, gradual, as it is.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:50.880
 In that respect, we also think of these five perfect, five perfects. Five perfects, perfect time,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.920
 perfect teacher, perfect retinas, perfect places, perfect teaching, as in this teaching,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.720
 Heart Sutra explains. In Dokki teaching, we already mentioned perfect time is what?

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:15.850
 Time that which is beyond the conceptions. That time is known as fourth time, beyond the conception

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.000
.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.160
 So that means, it is the great period from the beginning state of the time,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:31.120
 is beyond the fourth, three times, in the fourth time status. That's the status.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:42.400
 And then, perfect teacher, perfect teacher is, again, is in Dokki teaching, what's called,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.080
 Buddha summit the butter. Buddha Kshakyamuni and the Buddha summit the butter has no difference.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.360
 This is the perfect Buddha, Buddha summit the butter, Dharmakaya Buddha, Buddha summit the butter,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.320
 to expo of these, these grades of teachings. Teachings in that four times, from the fourth time,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.720
 expo.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:16.480
 So Dharmakaya Buddha of Dokki. Far from the retinas is, then, it's self-discipline,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.040
 always in the teachings, self-discipline emanated all the retinas. That means,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.320
 no difference from the natural level, the religious level, everything. It's all the same.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:36.240
 And that means, what? Also, in the Buddha's own perceptions, Buddha's own conceptions,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:45.440
 that everyone is, is in purity status. On Buddha's, Buddha or the Buddha, him or her,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:55.440
 when they perceive things, they not perceive as, as, for them, we talk for, for their self, I think

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.440
,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.520
 that they're not really perceiving. It's any kind of, I mean, in purity status.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.440
 Everything is purity status. Everything is a display of the primordial essence,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.710
 self-discipline, primordial essence. Everything is a display of the primordial essence. In the

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.360
 Buddha's,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:23.440
 his own perception, his own realizations, his own display of the primordial essence.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:33.520
 This self-discipline also can be understanding, too. One is, Buddha, his own display of his own

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.120
 realizations or that everything is enlightened status. There's nothing is not enlightened.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.680
 What in the teaching said, in the Gaurangara teaching said, everything is enlightened. Even the

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.240
 Buddha

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:54.160
 is looking to find one is not pure or impure. There's nothing to find. Everything is pure.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:01.200
 That's how the Buddha's there. And each, each individual, for example, each individual,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.160
 all those self emanated from the primordial essence, their primordial essence, all that displays,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:18.240
 arises from self-discipline of the primordial essence. Therefore, all is purity. Whatever the

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.920
 illusion hold, the grasping, you want it, they cling and hold. And that, for the reality level,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:33.280
 is all purity status, primordial substance. Therefore, there's nothing is in it. All is purity

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:33.520
 status.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:42.720
 And for those reasons, what in the teaching said, said, see, the way we are understanding things,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.240
 everything is pure, as I said many times. Of course, the sentient beings don't see that

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:56.720
 in that. Don't see. See, because cataracts of the dualities, cataracts of the dualities,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.320
 that's, they won't see that. Otherwise, it is all pure. Who made that cataract of duality?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:15.120
 Nobody else did that and put all our, on our existence. It's one's own creation of the

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:24.320
 grasping. We create. Otherwise, all is pure. Pure. So therefore, I mean, therefore,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.400
 all the raccoons are the western beings, enlightened beings, on reality levels.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.720
 Now we're looking, the guilty level, we're looking from the repressed point of view.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:46.560
 All one's own pure, evenness point of view. We're looking. So the time is beyond the three time

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:56.720
 and the fourth time. And the retinues are all display of the primordial wisdom. Each of everyone

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:04.960
 is a display of their own sub-display of the wisdom as it is. But see, also everything is

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:14.240
 in that pureed status, pureed status. And the perfect places. Then is all enlightened status.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:20.320
 And in what, in the way the energy is said, everything is enlightened. Nothing is not

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:28.800
 enlightened. Five elements are enlightened. All five primordial bruddhas. Five aggregators are

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:34.880
 enlightened. And that in the teaching we went through in the Dokhi teaching too. All is

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:42.400
 Sambukaya bruddhas. So in the reality, the Dokhi level, what is it? Everything is display of the

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:50.320
 three caayas. Dharmakaya, Sambukaya, and Nirmakaya realizables. Everything is that display status.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:16:00.480
 So therefore, area is Akanistha. Area or place, perfect place, is Akanistha. It's beyond the

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:14.220
 dualities. Beyond the duality, it is display of the primordial wisdom. Akanistha, beyond the dual

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.640
ity.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:23.040
 On that, not under, not within the dualities. It is pureed status. So that is what, that.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.200
 Again from the request point of view or from the Buddha's own point of view, presuming that

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.680
 everything

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:37.680
 is purely display. Then the teaching itself, the great absolute truth teachings. Pandyabhara

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.480
 nadai is an absolute truth teachings. It's not related to the teachings. It's also direct pointing

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:52.640
 out teaching. Buddha each time pointing up one up another. Another pointing out to wake up us from

00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:00.270
 the ego cleanliness. Wake up that book. It's how we have it in patterns, habit patterns. Release

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:00.720
 that

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.320
 notion of the habit pattern. Habit pattern, ego clinging itself is immediate. It's not something

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 solid, existing things. But even though yet it's not solid existing, it is the trouble matters.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:21.440
 From the beginning of time until now, to our own self as well as others. All living beings.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:30.140
 So what is teaching? Teaching is a great teaching of the absolute truth. Same as the zoki teachings

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.560
.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.680
 So that is what kind of generally understand. Again, in the sense that we also, again it's

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.600
 accorded teaching, following the accorded teaching of the great master and the great master letter

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:57.360
 and the great post zoki teacher of the Tibetan. So this is heart sutra, that is as zoki teaching

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.640
 or the very other teaching and as is the teaching from the hiri sense. So that is
