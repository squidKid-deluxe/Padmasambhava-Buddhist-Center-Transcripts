00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 I like the simple essence of that, but of course there is more about these teachings in all those

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.000
 beautiful books that lay out of such great masses.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 These, they are what they taught, what Buddha taught, is exactly truth as truth.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Therefore, Buddha is a teacher of the truth. Buddha is a teacher of the nature of where things are.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Buddha didn't really deprecated anything from the reality or exaggerated anything to what is there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 It's exactly simple pointed out of the way things are.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 This four-renowned session, then commonly known as four-renowned session, is so important.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 All those practicing lineage masters said, "You must reflect that."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Every session makes us more precious, how important and how beautiful.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.150
 We become more, as I said, humane, not just hovering on the space, not just hovering on the ground,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.000
 ignoring things and jumping.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 But we become more practical, more knowledgeable and more humane, more knowledgeable,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.160
 so that we will appreciate ourselves and appreciate our family, friends, neighbors and all the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.000
 situations.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Situations. Deep down what he does is softening our heart, softening our heart.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 In the teaching he said, "What is the sign of the knowledge or sign of the study?"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Really the best sign of the study. Have you started Buddha teaching?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.370
 Have you started? Have you know that the best sign of the study is that the individual's conduct

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.000
 becomes so gentle.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.370
 The conduct becomes so gentle. Therefore, often individuals, even villages, in our area villages

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.000
 said that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It's a very huge thing to do. That person has become so peaceful and very soft.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 It makes soft and gentle. That is the sign of the knowledge of the Buddha teaching.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Very down to the ground and humble and simple, yet very relaxed, inwardly beautiful.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And what is our ability, you see? The sign of the meditation, the individual, is less emotions.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Less emotions are the signs of now meditation or practicing work.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.440
 In that individual, our ability, you see, in our area, they say, "Now that individual has warmth in

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.000
 their heart."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Warmth in their heart. Their heart becomes warm. Otherwise, what that opposite also indicates.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Heart is cold. Heart is strong as solid stone. Cold and ice and stone.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 That is not the sign of the practitioners in the meditation.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 So open to heart. Warm up. What can you see?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.850
 This person has now warmth in heart. I'm so happy his or her practice is going so well in the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.000
 direction.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 They really use it in our areas.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.040
 This is. So therefore, this reflection of this form is always in the teachings said in the great

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.000
 Masters.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Every session you should reflect that. So that's what I'm talking here today.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.500
 When we practice this, when you sit up with this breathing, purification exercise, we should

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.000
 reflect.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Read these prayers. Prayers are the reminding of this teaching, this meaning.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And then reflect, observe that and stay there for a few seconds.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.680
 In the teaching, often said, "When you do this, then your heart is soft and warm continually during

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.000
 practices."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 It really warm up your heart. And deep, don't grow.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And if you don't do that, even in the many times in the teachings.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.200
 And that is great Master, for example, Kempo Makchon, said, or his great teacher, "Nyukhilunto,"

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.000
 said to Kempo Makchon.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 If you don't reflect that at the beginning of this session,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 even your beginning of the session, of the session, that maybe three hour or three hour session,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 you practice over that time, or maybe one hour.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 At the beginning of the time, you maybe could be very soft-hearted practitioner.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.560
 But if you didn't reflect at the end of the session, ending, your heart becomes even more kind of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.000
 hard sometimes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 You carry it with intellectuals, all that. So therefore, this is really important.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 With this understanding, then, so reflect. And I want to reflect that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Then again, as I said, after this post-breathing purification exercise,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and then just reflect with these four different points.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And after that, then do bring about joy and appreciation.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful it is.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And yet also, it is, it allows my time to use this opportunity to benefit myself to other things.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 I can really sincerely wish and think and reflect and bring about joy and appreciation in heart.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 As I said before, many times.
