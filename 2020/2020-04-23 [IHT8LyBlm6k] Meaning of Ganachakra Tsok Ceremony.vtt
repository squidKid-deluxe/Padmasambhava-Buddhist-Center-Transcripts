00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 In the end, what are the teachings? To get the realization of the absolute nature of our mind or to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.960
 discover the Buddha nature.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:17.040
 Buddha nature, we need two merits. Merit is also known as accumulation merit versus meritus.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.070
 So this making Ganachakra offering is really one of the very powerful skillful means of the

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.960
 practices of the Vajrayana teachings.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:37.610
 The teachings are accumulated immediately. So many merits, not just accumulated merits, but also a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.920
 Muslim merit in the teaching center.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.800
 It's very special. Then also during the Nanachakra offering, for example, we couldn't do too much

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 of this 10th day

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 of the Purya of Gurbel Masambhava and the 25th day of the ceremony of the Dakanishin so that we

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.940
 couldn't do too much.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 But if you're able to do those, it's really accumulated so strongly merit immediately.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 But at the same time, it is the purification. It's the healings. And what in the teaching state?

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:23.300
 Yes, we do. Since we're practitioners, we can also, even though we're practitioners, I shouldn't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.940
 say since,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 practitioners, we can make moral mistakes too. And we make mistakes in the past lifetimes too.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 And we also sometimes miss our commitment, what we promised, what we should do.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 And particularly related with vows, such as Vinaya vows, Bodhisattva vows, and Vajrayana vows,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 known as Samayas.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 We break that. Whenever you do this Nanachakra offering, do that. It is also really restoring your

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.940
 vows.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 Cleansing what we broke in Samayas or mixed up our vows and all that, we're cleansing that error

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 and mistake.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.190
 Same time, we're restoring that and accumulating merit. So therefore, this Ganachakra offering is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 very, very special.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.300
 And Ganachakra is a Sanskrit word, and we translate it in English, maybe the will of the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.940
 accumulation, will.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:39.940
 W-H-E-E-L-L, will of accumulations. Or it can be translated will of assembly, assemblies.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:51.160
 What are those wills? In the teaching, there are four wills. Four wills or four accumulations of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.940
 hope.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:02.940
 And what I see translated, assembly. And also it can be translated gathering too. Gathering,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.940
 accumulation, assemblies.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.940
 And what is forced gathering?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.940
 Forced gathering is a Portland, male and female, Vidyadhara, are gathered together.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:31.760
 So that means, Sangha members come together, do the Nanachakra. It's a gathering of Portland, Vidy

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.940
adhara, male and female.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:42.300
 Or yogi and yoginis, gathered together. That is known as forced gathering or forced accumulation,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.940
 forced assembly.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.940
 Second gathering is delightful gathering of the deities or the Buddhas.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.610
 When we made the Banachakra offering, even they are just making that just kind of as a party, but

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.940
 we are really inviting so many invisible, enlightened beings that maybe we don't see all that.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.400
 What are those are known as Vidyadhara teaching. Guru, Deva, Dakinis and Dharmapalas. All

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.940
 assemblies are invited.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.940
 So then now, all the ordinary gathered students are gathered or practitioners are gathered.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.140
 That is one, not just the only. Now all the deities, male and female, delightful gathered to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.940
 participate in that ceremony and that celebration.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:50.660
 That is too stable. So that is the second. Third gathering is all the sumptuous offerings are

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.940
 gathered.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:02.600
 Sumptuous offerings of them, whatever you can offer. Not just one apple or two bananas. That is

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.940
 still okay.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.160
 You don't have the capabilities in the remote countries, in the Himalaya region, up in the Arirang,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.940
 the mountain, you are alone staying there.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:21.300
 Maybe you can do that. But some, this offering is also is not something that is going, somebody is

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.940
 going to check that with you. You can eat you in that.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:33.600
 So, some nice revealed offerings. But in a teaching setting, all the offerings are dedicated for

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.940
 that purpose.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.440
 Not just a laptop of food. Or something that, "Oh, I couldn't use this for longer. It would be in

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.940
 my room." Now I am going to.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:54.290
 There is no, no, something, whatever it is you can do. Something is possible. Nice, clean, but

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.940
 dedicated for that.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.940
 Have you kept that in the refrigerator for my ceremony or Nanakaka ceremony? That is okay.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.960
 It is all your intention that you dedicated, you kept in refrigerator or in the box, food, free,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.940
 freezers.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.320
 You kept long. Now you defrost and you break that. That is fine. But not just a kind of laptop of

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.940
 food, we kept it in the long time.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.360
 How can I do it too? But I can put it on toast. So, on the fridge and then kind of that. That is

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.940
 not it.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.940
 You can use your salad, but not for offering. So, that is really you.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:41.470
 So, that is all the sumptuous foods. Sumptuous, whatever, good food. Whatever you can pour. Nice

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.940
 ones.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.690
 When you put those displays, what in the teaching set, put those all the foods on the right side of

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.940
 the table.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:58.350
 Every year the choice. And that side of the table put all the drinks. And particularly during this

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.940
 time, swap drinks.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:08.300
 It is good. Swap drinks. All those such as any swap drinks. Those like apple cider, apple cranberry

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.940
 juice.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:18.510
 All those really swap drinks. Not hot drinks, dark too much. Because then, if you do that, then it

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.940
 really could lose our mindfulness of the yogini.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:32.940
 So, therefore many great masters in modern time mentioned don't use, just use the swap drinks.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.940
 Which is good. Good for your health. Good for the health. All the time. So, swap drinks.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:45.940
 Try and put that. All the sumptuous foods. So, that is like sumptuous offering.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:53.930
 Oh well, when you put that offerings on the table, then upper order before the ceremony complete,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.940
 we should not check that from there.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.940
 And use from the first purpose. Completely dedicated, therefore, until we finish the ceremony.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.940
 Completely keep that.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.950
 And the court assembly and the gathering and the accumulation is, then, the Vasudha Mary and the

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.940
 accumulation Mary.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:24.390
 Then it really gathers. What that gathers? Because all the Sangha members, the harmonious Sangha

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.940
 members who were practicing together,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:35.300
 dedicated, they came to that medal and all the joyful delight for the assembly of the deities, g

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.940
urus, devas, dakinis, dharmaparas came there,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:46.180
 and now all the Sanghibas offering is the making offering. Now, that yogi and yoginis are very high

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.940
 elective stage of the meditative stage.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:57.940
 With the visualization of the creation stage, the complete stage of the disorganized stage.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.940
 That stage is combined together, then you are doing the ceremony.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:11.300
 In the teachings, it really will bring the beautiful kind of, it's ignited, a splinter call of the

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:11.940
 realization.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:23.090
 And then purify the obstacles, restore, then all the lapse of Samayas and vows, and purify the neg

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.940
ativities and obscurations to Mary.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:36.270
 So therefore, it's also named Jhana, Jhaka. Jhana means accumulation, and Jhaka means will, the

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:45.940
 continuum, unending wills of this.
