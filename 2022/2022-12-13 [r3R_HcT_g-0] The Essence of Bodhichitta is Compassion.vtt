00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680
 In the doubt that, that is the doubt, that bodhi chitta, and of course we all know that bodhi ch

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.000
itta,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 but again bodhi chitta, essence of bodhi chitta is compassion.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.490
 And compassion, we have to feel compassion, we all think why we have to feel it, why we have to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 feel it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.210
 For a Buddha then, everyone is being so kind and so important for us, once upon a time, so many

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.000
 times.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 And why say that everyone becomes so kind to us, once upon a time, so many times?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Because we, so, we are now, we take this birth. This is not the first time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 We take so many births in the samsara, so many days, you know, every number.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 Most of the time, we come birth to the parents. Therefore, those parents have been very kind to us,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 very similar parents now,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 who help us to grow and be as we are now, because our parents, same way they did in the past.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.230
 Therefore, we really like to return their kindness and support them, that I like to return to all

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.000
 of them.
