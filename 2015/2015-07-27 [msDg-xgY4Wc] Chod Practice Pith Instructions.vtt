00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 The Chod practice, but at the same time those who know us or don't know, I think it's good to do

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.000
 practice together.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 The Chod practice is one of the very powerful practices in the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'm going to show those things at this time more than this, but it's really considered one of the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.000
 very powerful practices to removing obstacles, diseases, and sicknesses.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Chod practice is very important.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Chod practice is very powerful if people can't believe in curses, black mages, negativities,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 extended, disturbing that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Chod practice is very powerful to dispel, remove all these.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Chod practice is very famous to boost our realization, possessions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 For that reason, the great Master Maathilabra herself said that many times practitioners expect

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
 result by the future.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 "My practice," she said, "my practice, not letting result in the future, immediately discovering

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 right now," she said.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 So it's true, immediately you can't let right, immediately the direct, you're passing in a way each

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 other. Right there, you're crushing that.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Anything that is grasping, anything is disturbance, and ultimately it is all mine.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 But immediately you're really transcended that and bring up that realization.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.980
 So for that reason, realization of the true nature, or the Dzoggy realization, for those reasons in

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.000
 Chod practice, it's known as that boost of realization.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.070
 It's like booster up. You're really drinking, like what's called power drink, power drink to shake

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.000
 up that, or power bomb.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 You're really boost of realization.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.680
 Or in modern mode, you're really adding that miracle growth. A miracle is now planted a long time

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.000
 ago, and nothing really is growing, nothing is seeing any progress.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 It's kind of retiring a little bit. And now really the true practice is called bringing up that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.000
 realization.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.440
 And that was, for example, in here, here, like great Master Jingwilambra said to me here, here,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.000
 what?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 But it's a boost of realization. Boost of realization. Therefore, in the way it's called bono.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Bono means bring up the realization. Cooking. So therefore, it's very special.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Of course, you learn the tunes and have the time to play that. But once you're dead, then you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 should be Māti-galabra.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.210
 You should be Pa-kandarsāni. You should be in the Gaurabhiyam-ma-sambhava, or Yishim-sogya, and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 that's it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.260
 That's it. Being in that state, in the display, in the dance, dancing in samsara, and then you're

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.000
 really doing what?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Laughing. Blow laughing. Blow laughing. Loudly laughing.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.390
 So therefore, also when you practice, again, those who are learning, trying to follow that, look to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.000
 the others who are doing good,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 who's doing that, kind of like, so cooperating. And then tunes are always, as you know that, you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.000
 should always mungal.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Very harmonized tunes. And harmonized bell, harmonized dhammaru.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.250
 And then it's just kind of like beautiful soothing. It's like big, beautiful ties and waves, just

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.000
 moving big and deep and strong.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And it's so nice. So please, those are just a few thoughts there. Thank you.
