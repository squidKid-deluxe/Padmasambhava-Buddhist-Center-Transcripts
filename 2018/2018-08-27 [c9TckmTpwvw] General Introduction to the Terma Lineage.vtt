00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.170
 "The terma" and then we go specifically to the termas. As I said, "terma" is the Tibetan word which

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.950
 means "hidden treasure" and then also indirectly it is saying "reworld" and "therma" so that means

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:25.000
 "hidden treasure" but "reworld" or "to be reworld" so those are the meaning of the termas.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 So now, one way to say this terma teaching, of course, generally the entire Buddha teaching is the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 terma teachings. All teachings and many great masters say that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.030
 For example, when Buddha gave the teachings, generally the terma teaching is the teaching of the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:55.000
 Buddha Kaptamunyas who came 2600 years ago. Buddha gave varieties of the teachings, all the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 teachings. These teachings, where Buddha brought them? Where Buddha came them?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.740
 According to the terma level, he revealed the primordial wisdom. It is the revelation of the prim

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.260
ordial wisdom. So it is in a way mind the terma. According to the terma tradition, mind the terma is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 from all primordial wisdom arising from all that teachings.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.870
 First, 20 will of dharma, second, 20 will of dharma and third, 20 will of dharma. All that teaching

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.850
 is the terma teaching. Buddha not reading or being someone that. It is all that. How he revealed

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 that teaching according to Buddha?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 Because through his realizations, understanding of the realization of the true natures, Buddha

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.000
 accumulated two merits for three countless eons in the context of the six paramatas.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 Six paramatas, generosity practices, morality practices and bacon practices, joyful effort

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 practices, concentration practices and onya paramata practices.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.390
 These all known as medituri activities. That Buddha practices and that Buddha hears to us to do

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 practices.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.670
 And medituri also can be divided or not can be divided into two seconds, known as the wisdom merit

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.000
 and accumulation merit.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 These six paramata practices are these two merits. First three paramatas are the accumulation merit

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:49.640
 practices, which is generosity, morality, bacon. Those all are known as within the accumulation

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 merit practices.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.880
 The last two of the bhandia paramata, which is concentration and six paramatas, concentration and b

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:13.000
handia paramata. These two are the wisdom merits.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 And so now, three parts, three are accumulation merits. The last two are the wisdom merits. And

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.000
 then whatever the fourth one, the fourth one is joyful effort paramata.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.370
 That is assistant to both part accumulated merits. Joyful effort needed to accommodate the merit

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:45.770
 accommodations. Joyful effort we needed for the wisdom paramatas. So it is like joyful paramata is

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.000
 like fuel of the both paramatas.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.960
 To accommodate that two merits, what Buddha did? According to teaching, Buddha removed all the obsc

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.000
urations.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.400
 Obscurations also there is variety kind of explaining, but obscurations to obscurations. All

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 summarize. The emotion obscurations and knowledge obscurations. Buddha removed them.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.210
 How he removed them. According to the Gendelung Mahayana teaching, Buddha removed gradually one

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:28.000
 after another. And how long he took? Three countless years he took that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.250
 Gradually with joyful effort, never give up that goal and beauty that our projections. And

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.000
 something good for us, good for us. Buddha never give up.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.510
 Buddha never tired, never bored, never thought that is enough, is continually driving forward with

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.000
 beautiful goal. Goal to benefit all sentient beings with the best upon completion.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 This sex paramata, foundation of sex paramata is completion. It is bodhicata that you all know.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.890
 Sex paramata is the tool to accumulate, to aggravate the bodhicata. Bodhicata, if you can also

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.000
 summarize more, can be drawn to that simple way, is compassion.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.100
 So sex paramata is absolutely based on the pure compassion. It has no discriminations. It is pure,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.000
 unconditioned compassion.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.880
 Or even more, no grasping, no clinging, compassion. That way Buddha accumulates. And when during

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.000
 the accumulation, we develop what?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.180
 Then five parts, ten movements, those kinds, those are the way to purify that obscurations and reve

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.000
rent the beauty and the natures of our world, these natures.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 So purify the emotional obscurations, purify the knowledge obscurations.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.550
 When it is completely purified, then Buddha is fully enlightened, fully enlightened, fully

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.000
 enlightened, then you become the ruler of your primordial wisdom.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.450
 We are not deluded of our primordial wisdom. Our primordial wisdom is not deluded. You become the

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.000
 ruler of the primordial wisdom.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Once the primordial wisdom is reworked, then all those teachings came from that primordial state.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Best upon compassion, best upon loving kindness, best of the exaggerated things are nothing higher,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 nothing lower, nothing overstated, understated.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.360
 It is exactly the way things are. And that is what in the teachings said, truth, truths. Exactly

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.180
 the way things are related to truth, exactly the way things are an absolute truth, exactly how they

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.000
 both are related to the absolute truth.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.020
 Even though they divide as absolute truth, truth, but the relative truth, the reality level, they

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.740
 are the same. It is the same status. Absolute truth is the relative truth, relative truth is the

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.000
 absolute truth. It is the same status.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.720
 That is how it works. So Buddha's teaching is the teaching of the exact weightiness of nature,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.000
 exactly as it is.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.370
 And for that reason, British teacher, Buddha himself said, he is simply just a teacher. He is a

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.000
 teaching showing the way things are.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.010
 It is nothing Buddha's teaching is a mystery or nothing can be anything, anything more than that.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.000
 It is exactly the way nature is.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.770
 So therefore, in the larger scope level, the entire Buddha teaching can be as, not can be, is like

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.000
 mind, wisdom mind. They are my teachers.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.200
 Then as we go specifically, all those teachings, how they appear in historians, one after the

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.000
 others.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.310
 In this particular, for example, we look to the Pandya Paramata teachings. 100,000 students

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.180
 teaching of the Pandya Paramata teaching is revealed by the Nagar Juna. Nagar Juna both these

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.000
 teachings.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.420
 Nagar Juna. And in the teachings, Buddha Gindas teachings in the world just speak more things, but

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.000
 teaching just appeared in the human world.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.250
 Who kept this? Who kept by Nagas? It is only in the Pandya Paramata teaching as a whole variety of

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.000
 different sections.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.960
 There is a larger section of the Pandya Paramata teaching and middle sections of the Pandya Param

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.000
ata teaching and small sections of Pandya Paramata teachings.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Largest sections of Pandya Paramata teachings are kept by the Gods.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And middle sections of Pandya Paramata teachings are kept by the Gandharvas in the teachings.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And the small section of Pandya Paramata teaching is kept by the Nagas.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.010
 Because all these Gods and Gandharvas and Asuras and Nagas are the disciples of the Buddha Shatyama

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.000
. When Buddha gave the teachings, they all attended.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 They attended and did the teaching. So they kept this.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 But this Nagar Juna became the teacher of the Nagas according to historians.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:41.310
 And they gave the offer to Nagar Juna. Whole 100,000 students from Pandya Paramata teaching as

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.000
 offerings.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And Nagar Juna is also known as one of the great medicine men's doctors.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And Nagas has according to the teaching, Nagas has often a lot of health troubles.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.010
 And one time they got a lot of health troubles, couldn't really cool easily and invited Nagar Juna

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.000
 and cool those diseases.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.390
 And because, as well as because of that reason, then Nagar Juna received the whole Pandya Paramata

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.000
 teaching of the 1,000 staff teachers.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 That's the renouement. Again, this is the reality of our dharma.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Even though it's written in the name as dharma. Dharma teaching is dharma.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Dharma is all the pantherists, if you think. Think. All is related.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Even though it's officially not named. In historical dharma they are not named as dharma.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 But reality level is dharma. It's not existing in the human world, those are.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 They are revered by the many great masters. One after another, one after another.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 All you look at the history of the pantherists. His dharma teaches.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 So we have to think of the largest global levels, what the dharma is.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 That is how all are revered. And of course, on the kalaitakra teachings also.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Of course, nobody says as dharma again. But reality level is dharma.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 It's not existing in India that time. But again, these teachings.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And many history said, just before his Mahabharic Nirvana or after his enlightenment.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Many scholars have different stories. But anyway, when he gives these teachings,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 he gives teaching, teaching again to the many celestial beings.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Not the common worlds and including the king of Shambhala.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Shambhala said, many, many celestial beings of the Shambhala kings came to receive this teaching.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 And they kept, they took their teachings and received their teachings.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Around 11th century or the 10th century.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Then Kalatakra again appeared in India, a famous master known as Tuyappa.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So in a way, even though he don't say that exactly in his story,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 but he revered it. Tuyappa revereled that teachings.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So therefore, we looked at all these ways.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 This mostly is like teachings of, many have dharma teachings.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 So dharma teaching is the mainstream of the way how the teaching is preserved,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 how the teaching is continued and how teaching is maintained.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 That is the kind of general way to understand.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Now we go also specifically to the Myanmar schools.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 The Myanmar school has preserved the lineage teaching by two lineages that we all know.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Kama lineage and dharma lineage.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Kama and dharma lineage.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Now kama lineage everything, what are those kama teachings are generally?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 The kama means oral transmission lineage.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Oral transmission lineages are again mainly in the teachings on the inner dharmas.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And such as Mahayoga, Anoyoga, and Akiyobas.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Again, everything of how this teaching came to this world

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 is all taught by the Buddha Shakta Muni in different forms, different duties,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 emanated different duty forms.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Buddha gives teachings in the celestial realms.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Why Buddha have to give this in the celestial realm?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 In the teaching office said that human world at that time they are not ready to receive teachings.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Because Buddha's teaching is accorded the readiness of the individualist

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 and their capabilities, Buddha gave the teachings.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Buddha never caused any teachings.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And also in the teaching said Buddha gave the teaching as a doctor gave the medicines.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 As properly needed to the teaching, that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Or also another example in the teaching said Buddha gave the teaching exactly where?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 With human growth, for example how our parents, with baby tongue,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 one baby will eat, eat, eat.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Or infant tongue, and then baby tongue, and child tongue, and then grown tongue.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Fooders are provided a core in their capabilities,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 a core in their readiness, and never force.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Force will make obstacles.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Therefore, Buddha is known as full of skillful means, full of balance,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 full of understanding, evaluating stuff, should be done.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 So Buddha gave the teaching accorded.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So that time, teachings are not ready to give such as in a tantra teaching or a tantra teaching.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Or even Mahayana teaching many are.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Not Buddha gave all the level of that.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 But Buddha gave this teaching in a Selahiram.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 They are ready, they are very recipient, and they are ready to receive these teachings.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 So Buddha gave teaching, and they kept all the teachings.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 And then when the available is ready, those teachings are then rewarded by one upon another,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 one upon another that came in the teachings.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Such as, and all that, teachings.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 And those are teachings, how the teachings are continually preserved.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 They are known as daskama teachings,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 preserved by the three lineage that you all heard.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 The mind-to-mind transmission lineage, and other symbolic transmission lineage,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 and other transmission lineage that continually preserve all those teachings.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And each of those teachings has all that three lineage.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.010
 Mind-to-mind transmission lineage, and symbolic transmission lineage, and other transmission

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.000
 lineage.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Each of those are different.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 And the mind-to-mind transmission lineage is the dharmakaya Buddha gave the teaching

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 at mind-to-mind transmission lineage to the dharmakaya levels.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Without as a subject and object, without as an activity beyond any activities, give the teachings.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 How they give the teaching?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Maintaining perfectly in that realization status, and be in that status,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 and all the audience also experience or realize the same thing.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 As water merges to the water, or life merges to life,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 there is nothing related to anything.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 It is beyond action, beyond activity, beyond the audience, audience.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 So what is the teaching?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 The wisdom body of the dharmakaya transmitted as mind-to-mind transmission lineage

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 to the wisdom of all human-like wisdom retinas.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Retinas, without as actions or activities.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 So that is available.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 And who are those retinas, who are the five dharmakaya Buddhas?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 And man and female, all those are the retinas of the dharmakaya Buddhas.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 That is really how the mind-to-mind transmission lineage does feel.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 The second is Sambola transmission lineage.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Sambola transmission lineage also contains mind-to-mind transmission lineage.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 But now, Sambola transmission lineage becomes, let them all, action with activities,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 with subject and object.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 That has failed, I think many of you know, in history.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 In history, that is two truths.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Sambola transmission lineage has non-human beings and with human beings.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Two groups started.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And non-human beings are suggested that it started from such as three Buddhas,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 the Jucheri, and as well as Avalokiteshara.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Avalokiteshara and the Vedya Panis.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 As they are the principal disciples of also the Vadashaktamani,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 they are also in the order to benefit for the beings, they appeared as like bodhisattvas.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 But reality really, they are Buddhas, absolutely, totally in life of Buddhas.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 So, when they appeared as disciple of the Buddhas, and then there is the teaching of this.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So, all this nth another teaches.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Then, they are transmitted, these teachings, Sambola.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Many of them, the Sambola teachings are connected with Mahayoga and Anayoga teachings.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 And then they are transferred, and the medhikari are transferred to all the Sambola,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 by the Sambola lineage systems, with the mind transmission lineage, to the God's levels.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Avalokiteshara transmitted that teaching, same way to the Nagas.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 And then, as well as Vedya Panis transmitted that teaching to all the Yakchas.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And so, that's how they transmitted these teachings.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 So, that is really how the human, or non-human lineage, Sambola classmateship lineage.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 And then, second is human transparency, Sambola transmission lineage, with the human beings.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 That started with the Agora and the teaching.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 The Buddha, probably seven years after the Buddha Chaktamanism, Mahaparin and the Rana.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.200
 And then, the three excellent great Vedyadara gathered in the Shri Path of the Middle-Right

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.000
 Mountain,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 which many of his great masters identified that in Shri Lanka.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Lanka is known as Shri Path of the Mountains.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 And the top of that mountain, these five excellent Vedyadara gathered together,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 and they met special yearning.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Yearning because they see, whether Chaktamanism is inside Mahaparin and the Rana.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Now, who will dispel darkness or war?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Who will assure everyone to the enlightenment? All that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Those different kind of statement.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Both from the seven different yearning statement, they met.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 And that moment, Vaidyapani appeared in the sky, and he gave the teachings.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 He gave the teachings.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Even the Buddha is, in physical Buddha, is entered Mahaparin and the Rana.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 But the teachings know this is existing, and this is what is very real.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 They are all entered under the teachings, particularly Mahayoga and Anayoga teachings.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 And that moment, then, they also hid in those teachings.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 As they received their teachings, they hid in their back.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Back in the sky in the teachings.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 And later on, then, soon after that, all the teachings started coming.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 In the Mahayoga teachings, Anayoga teachings came to this human world

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 and started with Kinsa, Zai, and as well as Bhumalakriti,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Bhumalakriti, the famous Vidyadhara, or the Bodhisattva Bhumalakriti.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 In the Tibet, it is known as Lathamba Tamami Tapas.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 So that's how that teaching came.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 So that means, also this Mahayoga, Anayoga teachings,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 all are connected to as a Thelma teaching.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 How that came in this world, even the Buddha kept teaching.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 So this is how it is.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 And then Mahayoga teachings, generally, it has two main teachings.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 The third section of the teaching, Mahayoga,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 and the practice aspect of the Mahayoga teachings.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And both are as the Thelmas.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 And now, the practice aspect of the Mahayoga teaching,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 I will go over here how this...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And the teaching said again that this great...

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 the earth with the Thelmas.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 The earth with the Thelmas revealed this teaching,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 or they revealed this teaching from very famous sacred western dakini,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 known as Lathamba.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And she handed these teachings.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 This is the practice aspect of the Mahayoga teachings.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Those are commonly also known as earth-heavy teachings.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Which is, again, how that is happened here.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Again, everything.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 See that this great vidadara gathered,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 this earth-grade vidadara gathered in the servacha,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 or the whole group, whole group places,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 which is not so far from the good guy that identified

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 this very famous cemetery called Kolguen Cemetery.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And with all this earth-grade vidadara come together,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 and meditating,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 and that moment, then, the great sacred western dakini,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Lathamba appeared in the direct perceptions,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 appeared right in front of them,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 and then she handed earth-grade vidadara teaching

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 to earth-grade these masters, one after another.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 So, first is,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 uttar-heruka, that teaching is in the lock-ed,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 the golden lock-ed,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 and she handed it there to the great vidadara master,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 bumal matars, bumal matars. And the yangta-heruka teaching

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 is in the serval lock-ed,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 and she handed that to the vidadara master, honkaras.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 And the yamitaka teachings is iron lock-ed,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 and she handed that to the vidadara master, yapar,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 siji, or magishiri matars.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 In the high-angle of the pima-heruka teachings,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 all that is in a copper lock-ed.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Lock-ed, and she handed that to the vidadara master, nagarjuna.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 And vaidyakalaya teaching,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 vaidyakalaya-heruka teaching is in a turquoise lock-ed.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 She handed that to the vidadara sambharas.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And then all the rakini teachings,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 are in the red stone lock-ed,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 red gun-ed or red stone lock-ed,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 and then she handed it to the master, vidadara master, dana santakas.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 And all the mighty forces of the worldly beings,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 like they can't relate how to capture and how to activate their power

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 to the poor benefit of this,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 that that teaching is contained in the gun-ed lock-ed.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Lock-ed, the brown gun-ed lock-ed, lock-ed,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 she handed that to the vidadara master, rambam-ed.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And then all the heruka teaching, known as 'tanga',

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 so all the mantra and the mantra aspect of the teaching,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 the mantra aspect of the teaching,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 the teachings are again in a zhiyantra.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And that is intubated.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 The gun-ed has many different lines of the gun-ed, that lock-ed.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 The strong gun-ed has many lines intubated, known as zhiyantra.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 It's like lock-ed, it has, and she...

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Akhet, thank you.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And Akhet's lock-ed is zhiy, zhiy lock-ed,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and he handed that to the shinting garbage, garbage.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 So that's how really she handed that teaching in the lock-ed,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 and she handed it to this great master.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 And they are the reveller of this great at-heruka teachings,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 of the prakras aspect of teaching, which is known as at-heruka teachings.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Then all that, particularly that combination of the embodiment

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 of all at-heruka teachings is known as dirtig nipa, embodiment of sugaka.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 That teaching is, again, a lock-ed known as the all-jewel combination,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 lock-ed that we made out of different jewels in that lock-ed,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 and she handed that to Gurben Masambhava, Gurben Masambhava.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 So that makes nine-herukas, nine-herukas.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And then later on, Gurben Masambhava also gives that final teaching

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 to the at-heruka, with which they don't have that.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And also that with the daras, teaching of each of those masters

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 gives that teaching to Gurben Masambhava.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Sambhava, Sambhava, Sambhava become the holder of the entire at-heruka teachings.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 So that is briefly about how these teachings are written,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 also in Mahayoga, Anu-Yoga, and Adi-Yoga.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 And particularly, maybe I should talk, Adi-Yoga.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Again, Adi-Yoga is the same.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.480
 It's a doki teaching. Well, again that teaching, but this teaching is not happening in a human

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.000
 world.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 And who will revere that teaching? Who will revere that teaching in this human world?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 By Gharab Dorty.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 So, even though it's not really mentioned as dharma, but it is dharma.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Gharab Dorty revere that teaching, what Bola already did, the teaching.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 In a select world, he revere that teaching in this human world

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 and share that continuity.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 So that is really about, generally all these teachings are very much connected to the dharma.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Even they don't have the name of the dharma teachings.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 So that is really what we will talk about.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Now, I'll go to the...
