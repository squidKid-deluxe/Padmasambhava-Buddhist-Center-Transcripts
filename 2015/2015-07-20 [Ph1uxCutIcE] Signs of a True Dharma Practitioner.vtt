00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 Talk with that and then try to be calm, peaceful, and relaxed, and not holding too much. Even those

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.310
 turbulences of the conceptions are like moving through our space of the mind and then that happens

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.280
 many times but trying to not hold too long time and let it go.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.180
 Let it go, let it calm, and let it go. Those are all known as signs of practitioners. That means we

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.430
 are practicing, that we are not holding the emotions. We are not becoming practitioners of the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.560
 emotions. We are becoming practitioners of the bodhijala.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.230
 Some sort of being sentient beings are the practicing of the dualities, the practicing of the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 emotions that always keep that activating, maintaining and holding and then that really that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.240
 keeping that. But being practicing is trying to not hold too long time.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.820
 Even the emotions arise that with the bodhijala, keep the meditation, keep the practices, keep some

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.670
 good heart. That is the breath really, meaning of the Samayas and then talk with them for practice

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.740
 and the Samahihi, or practice, you practices, all the dara, the hymsojaya practices, all the three

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.160
 root practices, you practice, all those really, and so keep those practices with those thoughts and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.120
 then repeat these following lines as Samayas,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.430
 that I am going to keep exiling everything, that is the meaning of this. So, it will be these, I

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.800
 think.
