00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 When this prayer is one way, it's very outer. Outer means it's not mystery, or it's esoteric, you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.040
 know? It's a prayer.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.040
 Because prayer is absolutely best upon the way of devotion. Devotion is not esoteric. In one way,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.920
 it is very upward.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:35.840
 Devotion is an unpalatable sense of joy and appreciation, trusting and soothing and calming.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.680
 And you can feel totally trusted and totally like to be part of that whole blessings and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.040
 environment.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.760
 That certainty, that beauty, all that is known as devotion. And devotion is the fundamental of the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.240
 growth of the spiritual realization,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:07.190
 or the root of the practice in meditation. And without that devotion, there is no way that we can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.720
 reach any further.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:18.830
 That even we are connected and practiced the most esoteric or the most sophisticated spiritual

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.680
 practice or the duking practices.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:33.760
 Without the devotion ingredient, we really won't become or reach any result from that.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.330
 And therefore, the devotion is so important. And that's why throughout Buddha's teaching, the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.320
 devotion is mentioned all the time.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.190
 Once you kind of settle down with the intellectual emancipation, then the system of that knowledge,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.210
 that understanding you came to be materialized and bring thought is through the power of the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.760
 devotion.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.360
 And that's what it is, practices. For that reason, a numerous schools of Dribid Buddhism are very

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760
 big in the ceremony.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.300
 They started targeting the seven-line prayers, not by the rafudin bodhijata, that of course rafudin

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.800
 bodhijata is the most important.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.320
 But the devotion, and when you have the devotion, unfailing kind of trusting devotion, that is raf

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.800
udin. That is bodhijata.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:32.960
 So it is kind of a very special way that bodhijata and rafudis are connected. For that reason, in N

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.800
yingma, they joined the seven-line prayer immediately.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 And as well as in Gadi's schools of Dribid Buddhism, too, the calling of dhamma.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 This is, in every of those great masters, reaching the highest realization through the spiritual

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.800
 practices, everyone said devotion is the most powerful and powerful.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.170
 Again, once we settle down on the leg, intellectually, kind of like some solution, or this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.800
 contemplation system comes, starting in contemplation.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 But when you come to the practice of meditation, then the devotion is the most important.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 And that's why this seven chapters, or this dhamma practice is one way, very, very special way to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.800
 connect and activating, sizzling of our devotion system.
