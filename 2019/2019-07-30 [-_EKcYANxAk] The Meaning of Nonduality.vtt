00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.700
 We know the word non-duality. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so when people talk about it, sometimes it feels

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 like it's kind of, it's a kind of unity, right? What else? Unity. Unity. Unity, yeah, unity. Where?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.220
 Where? Unity, yeah, unity. Right, so you would have an object, you have a subject, a non-duality,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.000
 you would feel like the experience of an object without the subject or something like that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.130
 Okay, so my question is, in the 8th analogy, like in Monchilla, it's fighting the rest of the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.970
 illusion, okay? When he talks about the 8th analogy, you know, like a dream, like a magical

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.000
 illusion, like a cycle, like the same, like a dream, right?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.480
 So what he seems to be trying to point out is that reality is like a dream, so there is an object,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.720
 and there is a subject, and they're both like a dream, but they appear, like it's not like there's

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.000
 no subject.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.450
 Yeah, and I'm just trying to understand which is the correct view, because if you don't have the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 right view, no matter how much you meditate, or how much you meditate, or how much you meditate.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.760
 That's true, that's exactly true, that's exactly the truth. Okay, now to explain that, it's good to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.610
 understand any part of that, how the teaching is mentioned. There is a relative truth, there is an

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.000
 absolute truth.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 You know, a relative truth, an absolute truth, I'm sure you all know that. A relative truth, what

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 this dream like, miradi like, reflection moon in the water like, all is a relative truth.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.720
 In that relative truth, there is an object, but that subject, the object is a dream like, miradi

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.000
 like, reflection moon in the water like, that is relative truth.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 Relative truth, nature of that relative truth is absolute truth, that's the truth. Absolute truth

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:21.350
 is a beyond dualities. Absolute has no subject, no object, it's not something, no subject, no

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.000
 object, but there is nothing we can see.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 It's that what the symbols explain, what they say, beyond the conceptions.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.190
 Conservation is dualities. Duality, we need to come to the absolute level, duality is stuff, stuff,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.000
 a stove of blood, there is nothing further to go, nothing can exist.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So, this non-duality, that is absolute truth. That is really absolute truth.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 So, when zoki meditation, when meditating or maintaining that zoki meditation, that is absolute

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.000
 truth.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.030
 That's what, again, may make it, where things are in the reality, or ultimately, we are going to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.000
 maintain.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.970
 How are we going to maintain? We are going to maintain beyond subject, object. It's not that we

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.000
 have created that beyond subject, object, reality level.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.280
 There is no subject, there is no object that we can see. It's beyond. So, that is what zoki is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 absolute truth. Absolute truth.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And all this samsara, what we are talking, nirvana displays all these relative truths.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Even though relative truth has two truths, the pure relative truth, impure relative truth.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.840
 Impure relative truth is the emanation or the creation of the bad dualities, and the purely display

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:10.000
 is then the display of the beyond duality, or the wisdom display, as it is truly displayed.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.300
 So, that is the work that we need to teach and say, and that is what we should meditate that way on

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.000
 zoki meditation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That is what zoki meditation is beyond the dualities.
