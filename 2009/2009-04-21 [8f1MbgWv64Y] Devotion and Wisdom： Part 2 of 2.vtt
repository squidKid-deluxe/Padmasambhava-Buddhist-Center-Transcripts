00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.790
 There are two types, or two different kinds of devotion. One devotion is known as a belief devotion

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.400
 and the other is known as the understanding of the reason, then you really develop the devotion.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 There are two devotions, and generally, mostly in the Buddhist teaching, particularly when you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.400
 started, that devotion is something that you started, through the content, knowing the reason,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.520
 knowing the cause and condition and circumstance, you pretty much understand, and then you really

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.840
 develop the devotions.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.560
 So this is known as the devotion by knowing the reasoning or by knowing the qualities and the dev

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.560
otions. For example, in this case, for example, what is three jewels?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:08.050
 Three jewels is one who maintains that, keeping up that, is the lineage of the monsters, and these

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.330
 lineage of the monsters who uphold that with courage and commitment, that blessing, that home, that

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.180
 is also the duty of the others, and who activate that continually, that is the dakinis, or the d

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.360
harmakanas.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.830
 And that, again, those who come in the language of the world, that is the dharmas, who follow that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.560
 language or that word or the teaching, that is the sangha members.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 So to knowing that, or connect to that, and then connect to your heart and mind, that is known as

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.360
 the devotion, which is developed through the reason, through the understanding.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.070
 So generally, there is like two different ways, types of devotions, but in that case, generally,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.620
 when you come to the devotional self, the nature of the devotion is jewel, appreciation,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.360
 appreciation and confidence.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.250
 But, although it's interesting, or it's cherishing, cherishing, it's just beautiful, I mean, it's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.320
 beautiful. And that, when you feel the preciousness of that quality, preciousness of the richness

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.020
 of everything, and therefore, you're going to preserve that with great honor and respect,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.360
 appreciate every moment, every inch, or every time.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.870
 And that is very beautiful qualities of the nature of the mind, that were kind of activated of the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.760
 growth of the spiritual realization of this bodhicitta, or this absolute bodhicitta, or the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.360
 absolute spirit guru, the dakini, as Roosevelt very master was talking.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.360
 So therefore, this devotion is important.
