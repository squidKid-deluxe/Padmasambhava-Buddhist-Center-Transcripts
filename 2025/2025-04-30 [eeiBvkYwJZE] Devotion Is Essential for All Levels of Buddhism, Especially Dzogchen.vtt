Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 7\nApril 28, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
 It's extra only the Monday practices. Again, this is, of course, according to him in the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.020
 Bama Nyingti, or the Chetsun Nyingti, it is a Monday, but it's not exactly a regular Monday

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:29.020
 as we go through. So this is an extended Monday, and this is taking raffles, and three raffles,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.560
 and visualize the object with refuge and pray according to the pit instructions. So that

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.460
 is, now we go to the, now to the, among these, there is five different things, one after another,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 and the refuge in the bodhisattva, and the practice, register of practices, and the purification

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.200
 or accumulate the merit practices, and then guru yoga practices, those are five different

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.680
 points, one after another is explaining that all is totally connected to the Dzogchen practices.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.640
 But again, to understand all this, and then we go to the, to begin the raffles. Raffles

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 generally, again, this is the absolute raffles, absolute raffles. There is the raffles according

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.940
 to Dzogchen teaching or the Nyungma teaching, as many of you know, those are called outer

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.480
 raffles, inner raffles, signified raffles, and the absolute raffles, or object with raffles.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.080
 So outer object with raffles, inner object with raffles, signified object with raffles,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.320
 and then absolute object with raffles. So we go those kind of, like, poor ways to kind

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:52.480
 of understand all different levels. First, what we, the raffles, the cause of raffles

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.880
 and is the devotion and the path. That is really the cause. That is the condition of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 the taking of raffles. That is, have to be, to also Dzogchen meditation, or this absolute

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.520
 raffles. So every level of the raffles is like devotions and fads, that is. And again,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.480
 we discuss daily, and of course, we all know that. Devotions are so important. With all

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.060
 the devotion and fads, there is no practice welcome at all, at all come. And for those

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:38.560
 reasons, Great Master, I talk the quotation from Great Master Nagarjuna said that devotion

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 is the path, is number one, when we begin with practices. That have to be. And then

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.120
 second is more important is the wisdom that Nagarjuna said. Among these two, devotion and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.320
 wisdom, which is more important. Wisdom is more important, he said. But even though wisdom

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.320
 is more important, before the wisdom, devotion have to come. With all the devotion, then

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.840
 even you have the wisdom, it won't walk. It won't, will not make that happen. So devotion

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.000
 is so important. For that reason, a great teacher, Brother Kekemen, also mentioned so many in

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.480
 the teaching said, devotion is like, like, as like will. Devotion is like, well, turn,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 turn the moving things. It's like will. Devotion is like feet, or put, feet to walk, walk.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 And devotion is like hand, together and things. Without the feet, you won't go anywhere. Without

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.680
 the hand, we won't pick up any things. So this devotion is so really so important. Among

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.360
 the seven spiritual treasures, Dharma treasure, devotion is the post. There's seven treasures

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:10.320
 of the Dharma. Dharma in the devotion or the ped is post treasures. When you have the devotions,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.880
 when you have the ped, that is the treasure. You open a door of the treasure, all the good

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.280
 spiritual call that will follow after that. And we combine that with the wisdom. Then

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.600
 really it makes perfect. So therefore, devotion is also in this case, devotion is very cause

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 of the taking rafujis. And then also in the teaching, the taking rafuji is seeing the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.560
 good call or call letters of the Buddha Dharma Sangha, then devotion. Who will see that? That

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.560
 is the wisdom. The wisdom will see the good call of the Buddha Dharma Sangha because when

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.160
 you have the devotee and then you see and then it makes sense, sense to take the rafujis.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.320
 So then we take the rafujis. And when we take rafujis, according to Buddhism and whenever

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.760
 you know, there are three different levels of the rafujis and those generally explain

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:34.080
 them. Those are the, maybe I'll translate it. And it's very easy to say three individuals,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:45.360
 or three groups of the individuals. First in groups of individuals, second in groups

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:54.360
 of the individuals, third in groups of the individuals. Those are also named small, middle,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:04.120
 and big. So small is kind of every individual. And every individual is in people what they

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.480
 want. They like to have happy, peaceful, joy, kind of good performance in this lifetime.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.360
 Kind of like to see that. And to do that, that fulfill. And then many people also have kind

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.280
 of like more connected with the Buddha Dharma Sangha. Oh, I like to take rafujis. I like

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.720
 to practice dharma. I like to kind of like take rafujis Buddha Dharma Sangha because

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.760
 it will fulfill my wishes. I will become quite successful. I will become rich, rich and quite

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.400
 well known. And they don't think of any other kind of enlightenment or anything. But the

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.740
 fulfillment in these lives, this of course Buddhism, all the following the Buddhism.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.440
 So those first group of the individuals, they just have kind of in a way, average attitude,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.440
 and then kind of protect rafujis. When you practice, when you go to temples, and then

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.000
 I make little offerings, and incense, about a limb offerings, offerings, do pulsations,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.200
 that will make kind of, remove the obstacles, the hindrance and troubles, and fulfill my

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.360
 wishes and I'll become quite successful. And it will make my family or myself all happy

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.920
 and all that things, put kind of that much goal, then take rafujis and Buddha Dharma

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:30.000
 Sangha. That is called average, general, regal guru and also in teaching method, small kind

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.920
 of way of thinking of the groups. The second individual guru is then group that they like

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:44.600
 to be more bigger kind of regions, or I don't like to in generally samsara. Samsara, well

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:53.080
 samsara, joy, happiness, don't really have any meaning. To me it makes more trouble difficulties.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.500
 And I like to kind of get out of the samsara and therefore I like to take contrary to the

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.680
 take rafujis and practice dharma, and with Buddha Dharma Sangha. I can't have that attitude

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.960
 toward, it's called medayoka or medium interviews. And who are those? Those are in the Buddha

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.400
 teachings. I mean of course all teaching Buddha teaching mentioned is like sharaka yana, sharaka

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.680
 in the pati buddhas. Their attitude toward, they don't think any other thing, but I don't

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.060
 like the samsara. I don't like all these troubles, the difficulties, so many disappointments,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:38.160
 so many kind of ups and going, all that. It's just all that is caused by the negative emotions,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.240
 the troubles, ego-clinging, and for that reason I'm going to practice meditate, the ego-less

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.280
 in the state, meditate and like to get out of the samsara, get ara-thahud, and do practice

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:57.160
 meditate and all that. And then practice and they reach the ara-thahud or pati buddhayana,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.240
 but the buddhayana which themselves reach in, become the pre from the samsara, pre from

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:11.080
 the difficulties. Those are the second medayogal practitioners and the teaching is it. And

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:19.160
 the third one is a big audience. That is then, it's called the mahayana practitioners. Mahayana

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.320
 practitioners every day are thinking that in the samsara has the troubles. Samsara has

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.080
 the difficulty challenging. They also say that they need to prefer the peaceful life, joy,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.280
 peace, happiness, that, but not just the only thing about them. They're thinking for all living

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.520
 because everyone they need to have a happy life, long life, good health, joy, peace, and all that.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.920
 And also everyone needs to pray for the suffering, difficult troubles. But to prefer everyone there

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:55.960
 desire and a wish I like to get to the buddhahud in life so I can benefit for every month to

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.840
 propose their goal and wish and with that attitude and then have the courage to come in best upon

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.160
 the

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:10.680
 compassion and wisdom and then take the rafuj in the buddha dharma sangha. So those are like three

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.640
 different ways of taking rafuj. And we all as lemahayana, so we're thinking take rafuj,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.720
 to take rafuj in the buddha dharma sangha and the same purpose to prove all the suffer,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.600
 people's obeings from the suffering and the difficult troubles and get the enlightenment

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.680
 to benefit it and for that reason I'm going to take rafuj and I'm going to practice meditate

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.520
 and pray everyone enlightenment, bring enlightenment. How long I'm going to take rafuj?

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.960
 And that is I'm going to take rafuj until I reach the buddhahud. I will take rafuj.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:55.160
 It's not measured by this life or some some kind of different statement but until I reach the

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:03.480
 buddhahud, enlightenment, I take rafuj. So that is general take rafuj. And then buddha we all know,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.480
 buddha is the buddha kyakya munis but there is all so many other buddhas. So many other buddhas

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.400
 and then buddha is also known as total enlightenment. From all the all the obscurations,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.520
 negativities, buddha is a wisdom, compassion, loving kindness and that is really the buddha.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:29.160
 But then there is of course many more details and all different three guys, four guys, five guys

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.240
 and

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:36.200
 so forth and all that. But anyway it's buddha. It's total enlightenment. That means no more

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.000
 obscurations, no more negativities and love and compassion for all living beings. From now until

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.680
 everyone is reaching enlightenment. And the teaching is then all Mahayana teaching, Dokhi

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.520
 teaching, Elvide teaching, according to Mahayana particularly Vaidyayana practice and all the

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.160
 teachings, those are the teachings that. And the teaching is also generally there is two teachings,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.280
 scripture teaching and a realization practice of meaning of that teachings.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:14.360
 Sakurvedji teachings are appeared in the book poems that we all know. Most of the time we refer

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.280
 those as the teachings but really teaching according to in the teachings, really teaching

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:29.320
 is the meaning of those practice. That is really the really teaching dharma dharma. And who hold

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:37.640
 that? Hold by the individual practitioners keeping that that and pose them what that teaching for

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:46.760
 example, a word and negativities. When you read that book, that is the external teachings,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:53.720
 dharmas, but really teaching is when you understand that a word and negativity,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:01.960
 the meaning that you apply, the individual applying that a word and negativity by body speak mind.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:09.000
 That is the really real teaching. That is in what I teach you called Dokhi teaching,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.520
 realization teaching, meaning teaching, scripture teaching is the outside these books and all that.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:25.160
 Paridhi teaching is the one you hold up that. That is the real teachings and real teachings of the

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.480
 Vinaya is what? Not just a book, really teaching is the discipline.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:41.480
 Vinaya teaching explain the discipline teachings or morality teaching. That is the real teaching.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:49.160
 Tokkuchu in Advaidya, Tokkuchu or maybe realization dharma, the practice of dharma

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.280
 and the Abhidharma, sorry, suttara teaching, the books, of course, those are teachings,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:04.200
 but really teaching is the concentration meditation. When you hold that is the individual

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.760
 one who keep that they're keeping that and then wisdom. Abhidharma is called the meaning of the

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:20.200
 Abhidharma is the wisdom. The real teaching is the wisdom. When you keep up that, as you learned,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:27.960
 learned from the book and keeping up that, activating that, then they become known as holder

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.760
 of the dharmas, holder of the dharmas and then Vayayana teaching and so forth, all that, that,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:41.240
 so that and then Sangha members, of course, you all know, are practitioners, all the Sangha members

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:48.120
 who was practitioners and who are also Sangha members who is keeping up those meaning of the

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:54.680
 teaching to the heart and the mind, not just the name, but keeping up that with courage,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.600
 commitment, joy, determination, loyalty, and the devotion of head,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:09.080
 pad, keeping up that teaching to the heart until we become the enlightenment. Keeping up,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:18.040
 that's called the Sangha members. So those all are object of Sangha members, object of, sorry,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:26.890
 object of rafuja for us, outer object of rafuja. Then inner object of rafuja is then object of rafu

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.000
ja.
