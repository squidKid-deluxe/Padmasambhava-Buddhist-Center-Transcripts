00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 In the lineage teaching, the foundational practice is with perfect motivation.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 That is the foundation with motivation, as I said, your appreciation, the body, all that, is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.160
 perfect motivation.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
 And then, the philosophy of those others.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.160
 And the second novel one is often in the teaching said non-consumption meditation.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 Second is non-consumption or no grasping, no clinging meditation.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 That is the middle novel, second novel.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 The third novel is simply to dedicate a merit with aspirations.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.680
 So first, we finish it. First, we complete it, which is the first novel of the motivation of the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.160
 aspirations.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 We complete it. Now, with that aspiration, we begin to do the middle novel practices.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 Middle novel practices are the principle of our practices.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.160
 This is generally what in meditation teaching is known as creative stage practices,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 or creative stage meditations, complete stage meditations.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:39.660
 On the other hand, also in this, it is commonly known as visualization meditations and dissolving

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.160
 meditations.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 So these two are the principle of our practices.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 This is, also there is nothing is excluded by these two practices.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.160
 It is entirely this, everything, this is within that, according to very young.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 Generally, you know, the Buddha teaching, everything, what do you see?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.160
 Everything is summarized or concluded within the two categories of true truth.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 Relative truth and absolute truth.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 And beside these two truths, there is nothing, according to the teaching, there is nothing.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 And now, this visualization or the creative stage is related to the practices.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.160
 The complete stage practices are absolute truth practices.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 So that is, in a way, a simple way to understand.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 These two are, even though Buddha highlighted that relative truth, absolute truth,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
 there is no difference. There are no different places.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 They are not in east or west or right or left.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.160
 All are, both are in both sentences.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.160
 Similar, the creative stage and the completion stage is not two different things.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
 It's same things.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.160
 Then why Buddha said these two, two truths or two stages practices?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.160
 Because our duality conception or duality mind cannot digest this teaching immediately.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:45.160
 Therefore, skillfully Buddha is ushering in it all in the core, the all in the nature.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 And that's why Buddha taught also, for example, heart-setter.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.160
 Home is emptiness. Home is emptiness.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.160
 And emptiness is home.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 Buddha said one after another, gradually Buddha said everything is equanimated state.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
 He did not see.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.160
 Because our mind cannot, duality mind cannot digest it or cannot understand immediately.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
 It's graduation rates.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.160
 Graduating, pointing out to the nature, natural states.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.880
 So therefore, in the, you know, generally the Buddha teaching work, when we meditate, when we

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.160
 practice it,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160
 we are imposed on higher circles. What do we meditate?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
 We meditate on absolute truth.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.160
 And to go to the absolute truth meditation, what we do, what we call in a story.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.160
 Shammata meditation, Vibhachana. Vibhachana. It's not something that requires the necessity that

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
 because our duality conception, we need that.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 Otherwise, we cannot digest immediately to the Vibhachanas.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
 We cannot go to Vibhachana immediately.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 Therefore, Buddha gave me exactly the beginning, how to stabilize, to make stable mind.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
 And what a great teacher said in the teaching,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.890
 Buddha gave us like a cold food, food, a cold, or like parent gave the food, a cold, and the baby

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.160
 said capabilities.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 At the beginning time, the baby peed by the breeze, breeze, like breeze, breeze.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:52.160
 Then those bottles, then maybe oatmeal, or apple pudding, apple pudding.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.160
 Then gradually, not immediately to give the big yummy sticks and all those foods.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.160
 Give me a cold and a readiness of the day. And that's what Buddha said.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.160
 Vibhachana. Because we cannot immediately understand that, even the perfect nature to you.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.430
 So Buddha gave for example, even to realize that to bring quite a good understanding of the

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.160
 absolute truth,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
 Buddha gave such a teaching on this.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
 Shammatas. Shammat immediately.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
 Or mind from the teachings. Giving mind from the teachings.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
 And then moving to the Vibhachanas.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.160
 So in Mahayana, Sotr Mahayana, as well as also Shabakayana and Parthi Vadayana,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
 what a very great teacher it is.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.160
 It is focused on absolute truths.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.160
 A reality level, in a Jhukchin or in another level, absolute truth is enlightened.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
 Reality truth is enlightened.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.160
 But whether they didn't say at the beginning time,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
 or the Mahayana teaching, or the basic Buddhist school teaching,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
 or the terrible teaching,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
 they did not say everything is enlightened.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 The right you leave, gave the teachings, to usher that teaching.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
 And then absolute truth, meditate on purpose, on absolute truth.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
 And to do those, all those Buddha skillful layout,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 there are six part of the practices.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
 One after another, everything is leading toward the nature,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
 and it's repeating, and it removes the duality, and grasping, and clinging,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
 and brings the openness, openness, openness.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
 And building up the energy, realization, one after another,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
 and removing the obscurations of the duality, the conceptions,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 that what we deluded ourselves, that is we put a fire in it.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
 And the guidance is enlightened.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
 According to that, according to Sutra Rana teaching,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
 you get the Dharmakaya realization,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
 then Sambukaya, and then the Dharmakayas.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 They are all that kid.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
 So that's what Buddha gave all the teaching.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
 But then vediyana is so powerful,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
 that's what we call the vediyana is so powerful,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
 so direct, so uproarious.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.160
 It's not going outskirt of the Buddha who outskirt or coming outskirt,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
 right to the ball's eye of the enlightenment.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
 Vediyana is good.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 And that's what vediyana teaches.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
 Our relative truth is enlightenment.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
 Absolute truth is enlightenment.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
 There's no difference.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
 Both are enlightened.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
 A truly relative truth is the display of the absolute truth.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.160
 And the absolute truth appears as the point of the relative truth,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
 as it can depend upon your existence.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
 There's no difference.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
 For that reason, what I said in the teaching was,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
 poem is emptiness.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 Emptiness is the form.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
 Poem is no other than emptiness.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
 Emptiness is no other than the form.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
 That enhance the real challenge.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
 Pointing out the absolute truth,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.160
 exactly its nature as it's both relative truth and absolute truth.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
 Poem is relative truth.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
 Emptiness is the absolute truth.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
 They say, they both are enlightened status.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
 And so do ourself.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
 Everything is enlightened.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
 It's not something that we, ourself,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
 our physics is excluded and not enlightened.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 Ourself is enlightened.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
 The subject is enlightened.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
 The object is enlightened.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
 We're all enlightened.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
 The reality level.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
 The ultimate level was the true level.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
 But then, we don't have that realization.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
 We didn't rely on that.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
 That is what gracious teacher Buddha Shaktaman said.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
 We dilute it.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160
 Dilute it.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 Or dilute it.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
 Then, from the big list of times,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
 we narrowed our openness, realization, awareness,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:15.160
 with grasping, clinging, and self-imported or ego-clinging.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.160
 We then honored ourselves in the darkness to the light.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
 Then everything become regimented and become darker and darker.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
 Then we failed long on the ignorance.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
 Or, you know, of the ignorance.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 We don't know anything in the past.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
 We don't know anything in the future.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
 Everything is a presumption,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
 or everything is just a kind of hopeful state.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
 That's how this ego-clinging,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
 block everything, or grasp everything.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
 You already block everything.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
 That's the reality level.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
 This nature is totally enlightened state.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 It's all this phenomenon.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
 So we invariate on the teaching,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 what we do in it, immediately you're activating that qualities,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
 that nature.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
 For example, the relative truth and the nature,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
 as the Buddha said, is enlightened.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 Relative truth is enlightened.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
 And that's why to bring up that quickly,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
 or speed up that realization,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
 will vocalize.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 Buddha gives skill for me in the teaching,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
 vocalize yourself with Buddha.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
 Yoga's are yourself with Buddha.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
 And not just you, Buddha,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 and not everything is not Buddha.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
 All is Buddha, or enlightened states.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.160
 And that's what Mahayoga teacher said,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
 three various states,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.160
 regular form, regular song, regular mind.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
 Regular means enlightened,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
 indestructible by the dualities.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
 No matter how much trouble we go through,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
 how much darkness we went through,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
 all this dilemma, confusion, anxiety, whatever we go through,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 nature is never changed.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
 Cannot change.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 For that reason, it's used metaphor as regiment.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
 It cannot be changed.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
 Cannot change, nobody can change.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
 Even Buddha said himself in the Pandya Parama,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
 that which is always operated by our teacher,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
 great kettipati Sri Ramoj.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.160
 Buddha came to this world that never improved

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
 of nature, anything.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160
 And gave the teaching that didn't improve in group nature.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
 And Buddha did not show up in this world

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 and did not give any teachings.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
 That did not decrease the nature.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
 Nature remains as it is.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.160
 Sky remains as it is.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
 Past, present, future, same.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.160
 Same way, nature is same.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
 And similarly for that reason,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 Grand Master Nkimba said in his teaching,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
 the Trail of Darmadatta,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
 that all beings of six realms,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
 no matter how they go,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
 wondering through the bird,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 the getting old, the sicknesses, the dead,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 and they go through that.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 But nature, within the nature,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
 then no one is moved out of nature.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.160
 All that magic shows happen within that nature

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
 and built it back that nature.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.160
 They never moved one sentiment or one item from the nature.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:46.160
 That is only our mind, what you are in mind, is created.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.160
 And we are experiencing by what we create.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 That is all.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
 So therefore, this visualization

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160
 is directly with discovery of this old phenomenon existing,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 all this relative as enlightened.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.160
 How that is. And that is insane in Grand Master Nkimba.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 No, really.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
 All five aggregate is the Buddha.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 Five aggregate is the Buddha.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
 One is there beside the five aggregates in the world,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
 according to Buddhism,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.160
 except the sky or uncompounded things there.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
 Otherwise everything is five aggregates.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
 What are five aggregates?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
 Poem aggregates, feeling aggregates,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
 and perception aggregates,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
 consumption aggregates, and conscious aggregates.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.160
 These five aggregates are five dhyana bullets.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
 Five aggregates. Poem.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
 That poem is not just our body poem.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:10.160
 The whole poem is a whole poem of mass or the matter.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 That is Buddha aware of it to us.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
 It is all.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
 And then feeling, consumption, perception, and consciousness,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
 all that goes on and on.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
 And then what in Uyghur, what are the other six?

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.160
 Five elements are five pavement bullets.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.160
 Elements, according to five elements in the Buddha's teaching,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:43.160
 is sky, earth, water, high, wind, and what is sky?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
 Sky is considered uncompounded.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
 Therefore it is always uncompounded.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:56.160
 The sky is very dark shoulders, very dark, dirty, and so on.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 So all that displays whatever it is,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
 is through these five elements in five aggregates.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
 Every variety is just whatever you see.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
 So that means already in line.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:16.160
 As it is, now we are the pit instructions of the Buddha's teaching

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.160
 or the teaching of a European Muslim, we are activating that nature.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
 We are not waiting to get enlightened or become Buddha

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.160
 under three countless eons, or seven countless eons,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
 or thirty-two countless eons, according to the teaching.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
 We are not waiting, and we are going to get that within this light.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.160
 Ever again, we have the courage, commitment, youth effort, devotions.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
 We really can reach enlightenment, according to the teaching.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 Even if we didn't get complete total enlightenment,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160
 we will become pretty, what they call, well-off.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 Well-off, really well-off.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.160
 You will stay with well-off and lead that, this goal, with well-off.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
 That's what we got.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.160
 For that reason, Guru Mahāprabhu said this.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 If you reach enlightenment, that's wonderful, you see.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
 Even if you didn't reach enlightenment, your life will be allāh lāhs.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
 Allāh lāhs, your life will be allāh.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 Allāh lāh means wonderful.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
 Sounds good, what a great word.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160
 Your life will be wonderful.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160
 If you reach enlightenment, that's so great, that's great.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
 But even if you didn't reach enlightenment,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.160
 your life will be allāh and lead this world with allāh.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.160
 And that we see many of those great practices.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 Really, practices, they leave this world.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
 When they leave the world, they are not regretful,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
 upset, they feel guilty, this and that.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.160
 And with such a joyful attitude, so calm and so peaceful,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 and they let fluid in the sky, or wherever.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
 I mean, that's really how it is.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
 So therefore, this is what this practice is.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
 And this is such a great thing, great thing.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.160
 So now, with this understanding, with this understanding,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 today is the principal practices.
