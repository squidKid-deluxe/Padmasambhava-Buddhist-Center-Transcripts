00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 The following part, relative level and absolute levels, two levels. On the relative levels, what

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 the teaching said, for example, for us, trying to maintain all good quality of the conduct, conduct

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.000
, those are in very other teachings in Samayas. Those are the Samayas are, Samaya is what?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.670
 Evoting all the negative activities or trying, avoiding the negative activities, negative

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.590
 activities for ourself. And with that, and the modious out of the conversation, the modious out of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 the conduct is performing the beneficial activities to benefit ourself, to benefit others as much

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.000
 as you can.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.410
 Kind of always leaning up that. And then, with that, with that, and then keeping the very honest,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.650
 all those, like what we call meditation practice should do, meditation should do as much as you can

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.000
.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.150
 With that, three worlds, those are really known as three worlds, but with that, even though you're

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.000
 keeping, always our heart is filled with both each other.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.570
 Whether you are avoiding the negative activities, our heart is both each other. And with that, we

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.810
 keep the both each other. Even we are performing the beneficial activities, also have the both each

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.000
 other in the heart.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.130
 And then, with also keeping the Samayas and whatever those practice, always both each other in the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.940
 Samayas. And therefore, in every teaching said, and every master's I heard too, and I'm sure you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.000
 all heard too.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.890
 Two, both each other is essential. When you have the both each other, you keep it generally, also

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.000
 naturally keeping all the, all the vows of beautiful, really, it comes blended in both each other.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And then, when we keep the both each other, our practice does not become basic ego practices.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Practices become really so beneficial, so soothing and perfectly beautiful.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.130
 So, with that practice, that is then the beautiful part. You follow with that beautiful part. If

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.000
 you follow with that beautiful part, resolvable, we have no doubt, it's beautiful.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.100
 We don't have to concentrate on the result. The result is our Buddhahold. Whatever you're doing,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.440
 this part is actually the cause and the condition. You're creating the perfect beautiful cause and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 condition, resolvable, but quite awesome.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.690
 So, that's really the what is. The errors of that is then not both each other. And both each other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.000
 is diluted. And anger and emotions, self-importance, those all are coming so strong.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.110
 It's the limit we can't help celebrate, self-importance. As long as we're the ego-cling, we all

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.000
 have this, nothing on the ego, but not the kind of, the power of honor.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.590
 Power of honor will be our both each other. And the ego may be behind, but slowly, really, kind of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 compromising that, deduce that, really practical way, kind of, but gently that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Then, according to the teaching, really all comes. So beautiful. So beautiful and so perfect.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Perfect.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Okay, so that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Then one more, maybe no? Okay.
