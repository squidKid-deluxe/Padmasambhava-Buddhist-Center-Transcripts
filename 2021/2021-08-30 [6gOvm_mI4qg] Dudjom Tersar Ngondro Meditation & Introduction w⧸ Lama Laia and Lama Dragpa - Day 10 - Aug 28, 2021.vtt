00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.880
 So, good afternoon. We've all had such a great privilege and good karma to have met the Dharma

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:31.760
 in our life, received some degree of teachings, and had the great opportunity to think about them

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 and practice them. So how wonderful. So just like always, we're always reminded before any study,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 any contemplation, any practice, just reflecting on our motivation and really reconnecting with

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:00.640
 our heart of hearts, our joy and appreciation for this precious moment so fleeting and yet so pure

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.680
 and beautiful, and really would connect with that joy, that devotion and appreciation for

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:19.440
 this precious moment and the arena that it's in. And then with that, just really truly expanding

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.080
 our bodhicitta, really spreading it out to all limitless beings and really, really connecting

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.720
 with that wish, you know, that this time together, this moment can truly be a vast benefit for

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.200
 infinite

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 beings, infinite and every single one. And then too, and just again, spreading that devotion,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.480
 that joy, that all beings realize the pure land and the true nature of their own mind,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.640
 be free of all obscurations. And we'll just kind of just sit with that for a moment.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 [silence]

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 [silence]

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 [silence]

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.480
 And so it's always helpful to rely upon the beautiful frames that our

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:18.160
 lineage has for us in which to kind of put together all the thoughts and ideas and inquiries

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.440
 the Buddha has given us, and also again then for our practice as well.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.120
 And so we've been, we're here doing the nundra together, and we've been talking a little bit

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:45.360
 more the last few times about refuge and taking refuge. And I guess an important thing, you know,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.920
 reminding myself, reminding all of us, we're here together. I have the awkward place of

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:03.440
 being the spokesperson for all of us right now, but we've been really talking about refuge,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.800
 and what is refuge? And basically, you know, some of the things we've kind of went over,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.960
 both Lama Japa, myself, and of course we've all heard and thought and contemplated refuge. It's

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.960
 nothing new. But again, from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment, we're taking refuge.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:33.600
 That means it only gets deeper until we're fully purified of all of our obscurations,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:43.840
 and totally let go of all negativity, and just allow ourselves to abide undistractedly

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.840
 and brilliantly in the true nature of total Buddhahood and absolute bodhicitta.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:01.680
 And that's the journey for all of us. And so always in the teachings there's the framework

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.520
 of really, like they say, refuge is the gateway to all Buddhist practice.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.800
 That means to say that, stating the obvious, which is so beautiful with all the Buddhist teachings

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.960
 in

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:28.000
 a way, we need some interest and some trust in the Buddha and the teachings of the Buddha

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:41.360
 and in the Sangha, which means in ourselves, of course. So our faith or our devotion, our trust,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:52.640
 is what all the great masters are saying, that our faith, our trust, our devotion

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:03.510
 is the gateway to refuge. And again, like I was just saying, from now until the heart of

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.160
 enlightenment,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.280
 we take refuge. That means it's not just a gateway we pass through and leave behind us.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:23.760
 It's awakening into the vast land of our devotion and our pure perception that only increases

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:32.000
 through something we always hear Rinpoche state, through our joy, through our devotion,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:42.880
 through our courage and our commitment. And so just remembering that both in our formal practice

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.960
 and in our post-meditation, in the sanctity of our shrine room or out in the world,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.520
 letting that all blend, letting that atmosphere pervade, working with our own mind.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.520
 And so again, maybe it's helpful to to rely on some of these little landmarks or frames of like,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.720
 well, what are the different degrees of faith or devotion?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:22.880
 You know, they say what's first, like the most basic in regard, again, here we're talking

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.400
 in regard to the Buddha Dharma Sangha. You know, the first degree is just our what's called the

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.760
 vivid faith or interest, interested faith, interested devotion, which is, you know,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.000
 we all have these degrees of us, right? So that's the most basic thing if we see a beautiful image

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.440
 of Guru Rinpoche, or the Buddhist Shakyamuni Tara Yeshe Soja, or we have the great opportunity to

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:06.400
 see a great master or a really well seasoned Sangha member, you know, or beautiful temple,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 anything that brings out that inspiration and just that interest. And you know, that, what is it,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.520
 strikes a chord when something some image or manifestation of the Buddha Dharma Sangha

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.240
 strikes a chord in our heart that feels familiar.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.360
 And keeping fresh with that, so that's important.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:47.920
 And then the second degree is what's called like, eager faith, eager devotion, longing devotion,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:56.880
 which is when we actually want to, want to know more.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.480
 We actually want our drawn to start to learn and start to seek out and to begin to practice.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:17.120
 And that means we're also beginning to learn more about what is the Dharma about?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:25.440
 What are the four seals? What are the four noble truths? What is the Buddha? What is the Dharma?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.520
 What is the Sangha? Who is Guru Rinpoche? What was the life of the Buddha? You know,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.760
 all these things, we actually feel the interest to learn more about. What is karma? Oh,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:45.600
 what, what, what do we hear about in negative karma? What do you hear about the virtues of

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.760
 engaging in positive karma and taming our mind, just increases our interest in our joyful effort

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:59.440
 and commitment. And that means we've actually begun to not just hold things up on a shelf or

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.840
 at a distance, we're beginning to mingle the Dharma with our mind.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:13.600
 And by practice and having more experience, we're having a little, maybe a little more direct

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:22.400
 understanding of the Dharma and then more insight into the nature. And then that begins to become

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.960
 what's called like irreversible devotion or unshakable devotion, like really confident.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:46.160
 And that's, that's that confident devotion is maybe where our trust is just deep. And that's

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.280
 what we really want to be evoking and connecting with. Because again, with the Dharma means,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:06.160
 we're really seeing what's true. And both absolutely and relatively,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:14.240
 and all the Buddhist teachings begin, right, even with just the emptiness of self. That's a big,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:22.560
 big subject and a deep habit to uproot. But it's beautiful. The Buddha is smiling.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:30.560
 So anyway, I guess what I'm getting at is the these kind of motivations or this kind of

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:37.840
 different degrees of our, our trust and our devotion, they may wax and wane. But keeping them

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.640
 with us is so important. And that's why, again, we're always connecting with our motivation

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:52.320
 and keeping aware of our habitual patterns, you know, are we shutting down? Are we leaning away

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.680
 from something that's a little uncomfortable? Are we forgetting the Dharma? Are we forgetting the

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:06.560
 Buddha? Are we forgetting the Sangha? Are we doubting ourselves and keeping that mindfulness

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:16.480
 and that alertness and conscientious of keeping really the lamp of our heart alive and awake

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.800
 and radiating into our day and our perceptions?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 And then of course, as we move towards the Dharma, again, towards the Buddha, towards the Sangha,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.040
 like we've said, that means we're becoming more and more aware of what's unreliable,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:57.680
 what's troublesome, and more and more about the causes of what's troublesome.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:06.720
 And moving, engaging more with what's helpful, what's reliable.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.080
 And then even with that, we can, we have different kinds of motivations.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:29.920
 You know, the most basic motivations are just ordinary, just our basic fear and hope,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:41.120
 you know, where maybe the Dharma can be like a lucky charm, or, you know, or we see, you know,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:49.680
 we really see that we're fearing the lower realms, you know, existing in the the hell realms or the

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:58.320
 animals or the the praetas. We're seeing, you know, we're looking towards, you know, the higher

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:07.040
 realms, humans, asuras, gods, but still maybe that's just basic, real, kind of more common,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.520
 but ordinary, who everyone wants happiness, no one wants to suffer, right? So feeling that

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:20.000
 motivation towards the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, just out of simple kind of fear of

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.960
 samsara and hoping for, you know, better, better rebirth.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.520
 And then the more we look at the Dharma, the more we kind of have a recognition of

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:51.840
 the law of cause and effect of causes and conditions, the cause of samsara, the cause of nirvana of

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:59.440
 cessation, then the more we can actually, then it's not so much that we're looking for an outer

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:07.040
 experience, but we're realizing we really have an inner responsibility for our experience.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.880
 So we're looking at karma, we have a glimmer at its effects, and

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.360
 we're going to work with that, and we have some trust in that,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.280
 but yet, you know, we still maybe are fearful of results, but we want to have some,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:37.520
 and should have, and through our practice have a deeper trust in basic goodness.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:49.280
 So I guess that's as far as fears involved there is recognize our own basic ignorance,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.760
 the fear of our misperception and not knowing. So therefore we want to know more,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.840
 we want to study more, we want to contemplate more, we want to practice more.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.440
 So even in regards to the Dharma, you know,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:17.680
 even if we just read a line of Dharma, really thinking of it and taking it to heart

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.160
 is Dharma, right? I'm kind of rambling a little bit here, but I hope it's helpful,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:31.680
 because what I'm talking about is really motivation and what actually makes our study,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.600
 our practice, helpful and going to move according to what we've heard our teachers say.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:46.800
 So really thinking about contemplating, putting the Dharma to practice, like there's two kinds

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:54.240
 of Dharma we're heard, right? There's scripture, there's all the words, all the sutras, all the

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:01.280
 tantras, all the words of the the Buddhas and the great masters, things for us to actually look at,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:09.680
 and then, but we need to contemplate it, we need to put it to practice. So the other kind of Dharma

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:17.360
 is our realization. So even if that one sentence, you know, we could know a whole book by heart,

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.200
 which is great, but if we haven't thought about it or put it, absorbed it into our heart,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:31.840
 that's the difference. And like Rinpoche says so much, like real, that realization Dharma

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:42.000
 is meaning we're gonna see, look at how much more peace do we have? How much more just natural joy

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:54.800
 do we have? Contentment? How much are we able to let go of our neurotic clings and grasping to

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:04.560
 negative emotions and our limited world, you know, we shouldn't be threatened by learning new

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.040
 things

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:27.280
 and opening our vistas. And that's why we practice, practice peace.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:53.280
 And of course, the other aspect of this is being aware of, is our motivation just for ourselves?

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:02.320
 Like we said earlier, everyone wants happiness. That's natural. But again, in regards to our

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:11.040
 motivation, looking at, we're really trying to gauge in the motivation of, of course, benefiting

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:17.680
 ourselves, but benefiting others really with bodhicitta compassion, thinking of all beings.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.280
 That's why like as we're doing our refuge, we're including all the beings are there with us

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:31.520
 and our mother and father of this life, without exception. That's like the highest way of taking

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:39.120
 refuge and motivation for the benefit of all beings. By actualizing all of our paramitas,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.040
 may we truly be of benefit for all beings.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:54.160
 And from, from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment, I take refuge in the Lama,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:13.680
 the three jewels. Sorry. The only difference that we know between a Buddha, an ordinary being like

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:23.520
 myself, is the degree to which we recognize our nature and we're free of obscurations.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:31.840
 Like we all know, the Buddhas are completely free of all obscurations and in the fully awakened

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.240
 state.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:42.000
 And sentient beings to different degrees have that same, the same beautiful nature,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.000
 wisdom, love, compassion, but haven't recognized it in different degrees.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.440
 When we've entered the path of all the noble Sangha from ordinary beings to the Pratyaka Buddhas,

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:06.560
 to the Shravakas, all the bodhisattvas, moving through all the ripenings of the Bhumis

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.840
 to the fully enlightened Buddhas, every single one of them at some point had a teacher.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:25.600
 And here our teacher is Guru Padmasambhava, embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:33.680
 And again in Guru Padmasambhava said so beautifully and also Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:42.880
 devotion is so critical. Devotion, faith, it's what opens us to

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:52.480
 the whole beautiful realm of recognizing and realizing what the Dharma is all about.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 So

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:32.800
 I think I'm going to maybe stop there.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.200
 When I saw just again, just a beautiful thing to keep in mind, like as we're

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 doing the refuge practice, of course we all have things, but

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:55.120
 just as in the way Guru Rinpoche is the embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.880
 knows all the teachings of all the Buddhas, his embodiment of all the Sanghas,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.960
 is inseparable from our own precious teacher in this life.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:16.880
 The mind of the Buddha is the ultimate refuge, the mind of the Lama, the realization of the Lama

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:27.120
 is the ultimate refuge. And our devotion to the blessings, our devotion opening to those

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:34.240
 blessings of realization and recognition to ripen our own heart is beautiful precious relationship.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:49.440
 You know the Lama's recognized completely and unshakably the open vastness quality

00:23:51.120 --> 00:24:03.600
 of mind and it's the inseparability of the vivid, brilliant clarity of the energy of of mind

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.840
 and it's all-pervading compassion, you know, that's the three kayas.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.960
 There's nothing outside and again and the Lama is there with us.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:27.440
 Our devotion opening to that recognition applying the teachings to recognize the vastness

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.200
 of our own mind and emptiness of our own mind, clarity of our own mind, compassionate,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:53.860
 pervading compassion of our experience is beautiful and that's again the ultimate way of taking

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.160
 refuge.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:05.120
 So Patra Rinpoche says that in the beautiful just praise to the to the Lama crowned with the three

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:14.880
 jewels of the outer refuge you've realized the three roots, the inner refuge, you've actualized

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:25.440
 the three kayas, the ultimate refuge, peerless teacher to you I bow down, we let go, we trust,

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:38.080
 we open, we stand with great bodhicitta, great joy, great devotion and keep going.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.880
 So let's keep going.
