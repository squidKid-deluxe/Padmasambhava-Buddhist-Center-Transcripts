00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 You ask, some degree, maybe it was repressed about knowledge, understanding, some degree.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 So that's really my wish, and that's what I'm again going to talk about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Again, the entire teachings are always, as the lineage said, kind of put them in three categories,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 beginning, middle, and concluding. And that's how we do the practice.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And really, it's not something newly making, something new systems.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Whatever we do, there's always beginning, and then always we do that,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 with that beginning, and then we completed that whatever.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 So this is, that means the whole body or that session is completed beautifully, perfectly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 This time is dharma, dharma or practice that's beautiful.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 That means dharma is not outside, as we discussed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Dharma is totally connected with our mind, mind.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And mind has so many different things that we mentioned, and you all know.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 What are so many different things?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Those among those old things summarize into, again, great master,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.310
 Buddha may summarize into three categories, those old, the good thought, bad thought, neutral

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.000
 thoughts.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So those are the really thoughts. And dharma practices me, practices of the good thoughts.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Activating our good thoughts, that means my good thoughts, your good thoughts, your activity.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 We are activating. That is really dharma, good.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And for that reason, what in the teaching said, what made dharma in the debate?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Dharma translated, you know, those great, translated as true in the teaching.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 What made true in the teaching? Always true means correcting.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Correcting from what?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Because due to our happiness, we always go with some degree of the emotional thoughts.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Maybe I won't use the word negative thoughts, but we always go with emotional thoughts.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And then maybe we go occasionally neutral thoughts.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.210
 There is really every count, the percentage of the positive thoughts, how much we are using in the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.000
 one day,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 time we wake up until we go to fall asleep, how much with every thought.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.190
 Most of the time is some degree of the emotions, related with past, present, or future plans, or

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.000
 whatever.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 It's all that is. There is neutral. What means neutral? Neither is positive nor negative.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 There is just a small amount, maybe. Mostly that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So this time we try to change at that, called positives, positive thoughts.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 That's what we need to practice.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And then as I said so many times, we all know correct the motivation.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.630
 So I say that, I'm saying that to myself too. We all say this correct the motivation to the good

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.000
 positive thoughts.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Those are our joy, appreciation, being grateful.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And then combined we do both each other, loving kindness, compassion, thoughts, we do devotions.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Those are all positive thoughts.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 It is good for us. When we have those thoughts, it's really healing.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 If we have the stress for thought, it will reduce all the stress.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 It will heal, heal those things.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And all the emotions that we have, kind of like that, can happen, it really will heal.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So therefore have those good thoughts.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So that is what the beginning, the beginning, middle of practice is.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 That's it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 What is the teaching of princess?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 We have those, such as thought of polynomial second thoughts.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And then we did devotions of faith, F-A-I-T, I believe, faith or devotions.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 And then both each other.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Really think, from deep down heart, for all living beings, those are good thoughts.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 With that attitude and intention, then do some prayers.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Such as we do prayers, seven-line prayers, lineage prayers.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And then also maybe you have some others, too.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Those really kind of reflecting mind with those, and the giant thing, those slowly.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 What your giant thing is your same or your giant thing of your intention, our intentions.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 One way, we activate in that way. Activate with pure presence, the blessings of the Buddhas,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 some of all enlightenment, lineage masters, we join them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So that is really of the first section of that.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Now the middle section of the practices.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 In this case, for example, zoki meditations.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Zoki meditation.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Again, for this zoki meditation, now you said on the nice question,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.550
 that is, we discuss in all that cushion, or sitting on a chair, we comfortably, perfectly, and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.000
 build tools.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And then, again, visualize, lineage masters, right in front of the sky.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 All your root teaching appears in the form of the Gharapam Masambhava, right in front of the sky.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Your root teacher, who appears in the form of Gharapam Masambhava,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 this Gharapam Masambhava also embodiment all enlightenment.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 That what you recognize is embodiment all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the Sangha members,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 and the Dharmas, everything really appear in the form of the Gharapam Masambhava stone.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 That Gharapam Masambhava is also embodiment of all the lineage masters, lineage masters.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.130
 A regular zoki lineage masters, who are, who brought zoki teaching to Tibet, that what we are

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.000
 discussing,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 is brought by great master, Gharapam Masambhava and the Vamal Mataras, and the Vero Chana.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 So see, Gharapam Masambhava, when you visualize that, see,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Gharapam Masambhava is embodiment of the Vamal Matara and the Vero Chana, and all the masters.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Really strong devotions, immense devotions, joy and appreciations.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 And if you like to do again, seven-line prayers, do that.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And otherwise, also you can do, as we chant.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 The precious teacher, Sun Sanghing, or Lama Ram,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 the precious teacher, please consider me, consider me.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.400
 That you, that you need towards your love. May my, please bless me, that my mind is mature and

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.000
 liberated.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 That means what? Mature instead of joy and devotions, loving kindness, and bodhicittas.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Really so warm, so calm, because of that, then I liberated.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 What do you, we liberated. Liberating of all the attachments, grasping, clinging.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 I have used the word, all that poisons, naked videos, we are releasing them.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That also indicated that we are completely bonded with the emotions.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 We are completely kind of tied up with the emotions.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And now we are asked to release. Please help me to, liberated that.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.580
 May my mind, mind is mature and liberated from all the negativity, attention, thoughts, and

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.000
 happiness.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Then next one, why? We have that praise in the Open Prayer Populators.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 I'm just roughly translating that, you know, as that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And may I have the profound realization, or bless me,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 that may have the profound realization is born in my heart.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 That means not, it's not something born. It's already here, but discovered.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 It's profound realization of the naked awareness, primordial wisdom.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 May, really, that is. And then you're making, again, strongly more.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And within this light, please bless me, within this light,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 may I reach a clear light in the ministry status.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 That means, discover fully, our primordial wisdom,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 or Raghma, ramsan, muhishi, sadhgum, evanus.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 We see that strongly, and I think that using the word,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 with the presence of the Gurbam Masambha,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 which is representing all the masses in the Buddha, Dharma, Sanghams,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 strongly, the value of Jaini, what we are Jaini, from Gurbam Masambha,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 I'm adding so many wisdom lights to you, and to all the beings.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Finally, Gurbam Masambha is overly joy, and excited,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 with the granting of that bless, what we will of course receive,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 and it is all into the light.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And the light has multiple lights, of the like sphere of multiple lights.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Small sight as P, P-E-A, peace.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And then merge to one's own heart.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Merge to one's own heart to our primordial wisdom,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 to our Raghma, ramsan, muhishi.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 It merge to our own primordial wisdom of Raghma, ramsan, muhishi, or Raghma.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Raghma, raghma.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Now, we are going to meditate.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Now, the meditation is nothing, effort meditation, it's relaxing.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 As we discussed in the Dokki teaching,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 these days, and you know,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 we have the, now what we are going to do?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 We are going to maintain our will, with the confidence.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Will, will of the rupa, will of the rupa,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 with beholding the will of one's own and in the rupa.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 We are going to now maintain.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 How are we going to maintain that?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Really, those three immovable, I mentioned,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 in the Dokki teaching, or the Dokki teaching,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 and all men got the teaching.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 It's really in the teaching strongly suggested

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 by Ganesha, Ganesha's teacher, Munchipas.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 These three immovable, three immovable,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 immovable of the body, immovable of the senses,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 immovable of the mind.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 We went through those.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Now, with that immovable techniques,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 we're going to relax our own,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 promote you, stage or rupa stage, rupa stage.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Rupa stage without any trying to do something.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Relax.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Whatever arising, whatever thought came,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 and not investigating n.i.a thoughts.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Also, same time, not wishing, or wishing something,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 or not wishing.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 That's what in the teaching often said.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Carefree.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Carefree without distracted.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 What means distracted?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Distracted by the conceptions.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Conservancy arising due to the external objects,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 as conditions, and then arising.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 All conservancy arising due to our memories, whatever.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 We're not going to chasing, pause.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Talk.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Let it come, let it go, in the teaching said.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And as well as oral instructions.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Why is letting come?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Generally in the teaching, Dokki teaching said,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 thought is display of the Dharmakaya.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And we didn't grasp me, clingy.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Clingy, it is already Dharmakaya states.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 As we used example yesterday or the day.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 When thought comes, it's for example,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 ocean waves and tides is nothing changed

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 from the ocean.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 It is all ocean, part of the ocean.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Thought is in likeness status.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Therefore, in the meditation,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 often I'm sure you heard,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 nay, du, reksan, neva, duva, rupa,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 abiding, movement, and seeing.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 These three are already in the Dharmakaya status.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 We're not trying to sort out this or I like only abiding.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 I don't like the movement.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 This is all playing.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Dharmakaya, sampokaya, namakaya status already.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 So therefore, we at the beginning of the Hiamada meditation,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 we need more abiding.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 But when you reach to the cruise level of the Dzogchen or rupa status,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 all is same place, one taste, one nature, relaxing.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Occasionally during that time in the teachings,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 bring up Okegal for a few seconds,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 more each other.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Low mankind is competing with all the sentient beings.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 To activate those you can chide,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 may all living beings have a cause of happiness.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Really sincerely saying that.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 When you say that word, where it comes from?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Again from rupa.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Pure awareness of rupa, ramsang, yishin.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And where that happening?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Play it.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 In the rupa status.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Where is the word going?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Rupa status.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 So does that word,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 reflective those meaning for a few seconds

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 and let it again be in the natural state.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Again not taking too much.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And Okegal anything of more devotions?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Thankful.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 To the lineage.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Thankful all the great masters.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Thankful to Buddha, Maripim Masambok.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Great Master Ramal Matara and Vero Khyana.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 They brought this teaching board

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 to debate and lineage Master Khyana.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Actually how grateful today I can connect.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Today I can connect through that teaching

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 as condition to my own true beings or the rupa.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 How wonderful.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 How grateful.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Again take those two seconds.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And again let that merge.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Back or liberate it to the rupa status.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Rupa status.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 So whatever called arising,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 whatever happening,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 play the liberating techniques.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Liberate it as is arising.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And also in the Dokji teachings

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 the practitioners can have emotions too.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Such as even those arising not holding.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Arising but see the emotions.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Arise the emotions.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Catch that with awareness and that release.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Release or liberate.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 Free.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Then in the teachings they said when you have that

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 even these emotions arise

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 but it won't create the karma.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Because this karma has no action.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 It's nothing really happened.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 It will.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 No karma.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Emotional.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Karma obscuration as we discussed yesterday.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 That won't happen in the teachings.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 So let it go.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Let it come.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 It's expiration of the rupas.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 A continually relaxing death status.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 So that is like the Dooda Dokji meditations.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Three immobile way techniques.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Once that is completed

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 then the kankaluri practices

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 as everyone, all the practitioners.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Then kankaluri that with great aspirations

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 and a dedication.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 That means once again we evoke the mood each other.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Thinking of all sentient beings.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Whatever merit we gain through this practice

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 made that benefit for all living beings.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 To every living being.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Made not just benefit that become the

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 igniting cause.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Cause to ignite their primordial verse

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 so that everyone reach enlightenment.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Enlighten, get enlightened.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And through that all the samsara cues

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 that will be completely transformed

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 into three gayas.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Already then wake up three gayas.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Really wishing that.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Concluding that break with aspiration

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and all the other dedication.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Dedicated merit practices that you know.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Dedicated merit.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And then that.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 That's the really Dokji meditations.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And now when you meditate that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 And carry this also.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 That meditation move into the world.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 To the post meditation.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Those are known as liberating.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Liberating.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And not holding.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Same thing during the meditation.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 We didn't hold.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And we need to connect to the world.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 And all the different.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Now there is so many conditions and circumstances.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Really arising our habit patterns of the emotions.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 These and that things.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 But even those are arising.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Trying to catch that by our mindfulness.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And release.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And change that attitude.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 With both each other.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Love and kindness.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Completion.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Or reminder of our both each other.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Love and compassion.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 So that we can activate our.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Our six paramata practices.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 And accumulate the merits.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Really gain that.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So with the mindfulness.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Move to the samsara.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And be then.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 One of the very beautiful.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Three wheelies.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Or.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Or the palace.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Practitioners.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 That who carry in the samsara.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And doing all good things.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 And the same time is not affected us.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Also other teaching said.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 So that is my brief talk for today.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And also I'm summarizing.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 That we have come at.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 That we summarize.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And thank you very much again.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 For participating.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Everyone.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Thank you very much.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 As I said.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Good time to discuss in the teaching.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And the practices.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Thank you everyone.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And of course we do now.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 The.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 What's called.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Concluding.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Practices.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 And all that.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So therefore.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 We're going to do.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 A little bit.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 A little bit.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 A little bit.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 A little bit.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 A little bit.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 A little bit.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 A little bit.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 A little bit.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 A little bit.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 A little bit.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And every again in the teaching.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 And you can do.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 You can do.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 You can do.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 This kind of.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Offering.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Is really.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Very good.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 To.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 A very good.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Very true.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 To.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Concluding.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 The.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Good.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Good.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Good merit.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Is.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Then dedicated.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So we do.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Let it.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Concluding practices.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 We have problems.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 People stay.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 With us.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 With.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Concluding that.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 I just like to say.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Thank you very much.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Everyone.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And also thank you very much.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.800
 that we can do this Zoom or this broadcast things.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.160
 Again, all the help and support of the Sangha members,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.440
 we really met this valuable so that we can connect it

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.520
 through this Zoom levels.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.560
 I'm so thankful, so grateful.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.240
 And also our local Sangha member, resident Sangha member,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.840
 will be helping support with this place where we stay.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.960
 And it's called Pemasamyal and so we are thankful, so grateful.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.000
 This becomes one of the really beautiful retreat lands

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.200
 of the Buddha Dharma.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.160
 And I'm very thankful to all the people who are helping,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.560
 supporting directly, indirectly, and closely, and finally.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.040
 And so I'm so thankful.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.680
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.280
 And I wish you all the best and good help.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280
 Good help, every goodness.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.000
 And also, please, since we all connected and therefore,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.200
 I would like to encourage everyone really keep the practice

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.280
 and meditate as much as you can.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.400
 Yes, for one week sessions or that, but try to keep that.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.000
 And as well as you receive the teaching from all the great Masters

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.840
 of your teachers, put that together and keep the practice there.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.480
 And then it is so good, really good for you

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.680
 and good for everyone.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.000
 Thank you again.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.320
 Thank you.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.640
 Thank you.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.920
 Thank you.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.720
 Thank you.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.000
 Thank you.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.840
 Now we do, as I say, the short song of praise

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.100
 In order to do that, what do we do?

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.740
 We're going to try again in several--
