00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 Dzogchen is restricted at a time, and many times even said Dzogchen teachings should be not more

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:17.000
 than five people, five disciples, seven disciples, and all the time is a single lineage teaching.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.960
 From Garabdoji to Hirisenha, Hirisenha to Medji, sorry, Garabdoji to Medji, Hirisenha, to Hirisenha

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.820
, and Hirisenha, according to the teaching, then there are group teaching but spread out a little

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000
 bit, but how many groups?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.240
 Those are the students of Hirisenha, students of Garabdoji, Masambhava, and Nomalamitra, and Yanas

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.310
utra, so these three are kind of, say, this teaching start, spreading out, so those are the way it

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.000
 started, and then many times, seven or the single way, those are the teachings.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 But now, modern time, or not just now, but many great masters have started giving the teachings, D

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.000
zogchen teachings, with the big audience, big groups.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.210
 I think time is ready, and what did Masambhava's teaching say? When the degeneration comes, that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 time, teaching of the Dzogchen should be stronger.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.190
 So I think it's that, because before the Dzogchen teaching, also maybe Prabhupada did not

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:39.000
 immediately understand what Kannur really did to receive that teaching.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.150
 But now, modern times, many people are excited with Dzogchen teaching and Mahamudra teaching, so

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.190
 when they're excited and more that Kannur, they are willing that, that means that teaching is, I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 think, a whole thing.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 So that's what I think is already happening, I think so.
