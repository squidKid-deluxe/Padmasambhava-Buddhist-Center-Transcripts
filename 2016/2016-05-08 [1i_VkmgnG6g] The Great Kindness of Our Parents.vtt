00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.190
 When we meditate, there is always a teaching said. As I said before, we meditate. When we meditate,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.900
 we start with the, as I said, the devotions, and the poor renounce of the thought of portraying

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:27.260
 them with the mind, and then, if we have time, do those who want to pray or call on our Father, and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.000
 then both each other.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.940
 The body jata is very important. The body jata has generally two, two body jatas. The relative to

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.000
 the body jata and the absolute to the body jata. Both are not really separated. Both are the same.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.300
 What is the absolute body jata? Absolute body jata is Dzogchen practices. Dzogchen meditation is

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.000
 the absolute body jata.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.120
 That's why, many times, the great vast KJ number said, many times, that's why Dzogchen teachings

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.000
 are also named as body jata teachings. Body jata teachings. It is a body jata.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And what is relative to body jata? From that absolute truth arising, the relative to the body jata.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Relative to body jata is then kindness compared to all sentient beings, for all living beings,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.110
 everyone, everyone, to all, without any discrimination, and let to be benefited, let to be helped,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.000
 let to be kind, kind to everyone's.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.610
 And also we like to have some reasons why we like to, why we like to be kind and compare to all

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.000
 sentient beings. According to Buddhism, every single living being is being our parents.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.980
 And we talk the birth in this universe, or in the six realms, countless times. We have no numbers.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.000
 For that reason, the great Master Dzogchen has said in a letter to his friends.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.450
 Even this whole earth, we file as clay, clay, and this earth, clay, of the whole earth, we make the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.340
 fill size of the juniper fruit. Juniper fruit, we make that size and say, this is my parent, this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.000
 is my parent.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.150
 Everyone really started making the size of that clay, a size of the juniper fruit, and the size of

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.000
 that is right counting our parents, how many child's parents?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.430
 Great Master Dzogchen has said, "Earth is not enough. We don't have enough earth to make the fill,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.000
 to count all our parents' names, numbers."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 That minute, we talk the birth in this universe.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.820
 You read that when we talk the birth, there are four different ways to talk the birth, as in a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:20.950
 teaching set. Egg birth, Monster birth, and One birth, and America's birth. Those are the four

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.000
 different ways.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.060
 Except the American birth, or the Monster birth, or the Master is also sometimes said it could be a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.000
 hub and a hub, but most of the time, we talk the parents.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.280
 Parents, we need parents, parents. So therefore, parents are, for that reason, all sentences have

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.000
 been, once upon a time, our parents have described our parents.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.920
 Why parents are kindnesses? That we should ask to ourselves, those who have the children, those who

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.000
 are parents, and currently they hold the title of parents.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.320
 If they have the children, how much are you concerned to them? How much do they think you think

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.000
 that?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Time they consider it, and time they grow bored of it, then how much are you concerned?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Those who don't have the children, of course, definitely. But those who don't have the children,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 that same concern, same thought, paid to us when our parents are bringing up ourselves.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.060
 Same thing, they did. And that's what, they're all kind. Why is the kind in the Buddha teaching,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.000
 there is two-way kindnesses, two kindnesses, if we highlight that.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Kindness in the samsara level, kindness if we are practicing in dharma levels, two kindnesses.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.140
 In samsara level, they have, if we highlight, they did four kindness activities, four principal

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.000
 kindness activities.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 First, they provide us this body. That's the first kindness.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:27.030
 Second, the kindnesses, they give us life. Life. And third, kindness, they provide necessary things

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.000
 to us.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And fourth, they showed us world. World. Or they told us world. So four kindnesses.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.420
 They provide, as both of you highlight that, provide first kindness. They give the birth, this life

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.000
.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.840
 They conceive it. Kept that. Where they concept it, ourself, in their wombs or concept, how much

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.000
 parents are happy.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Oh, now some of this concept, something is going to come out.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.060
 They feel, they call the triggers. And talking of that, taking care of that. And particularly

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.000
 mother, taking care of that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 In the teachings, mother's nourishing her own nutrition going, feeding to us to bring growth.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And she provided her night's sleep during the daytime rest, thinking of her concept of babies,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 babies.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.730
 And carried ourselves for ten months or nine months. That long, with joy, with happiness, something

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.000
 is coming.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 That, that. And then we are born. We are born brilliant.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:03.340
 So he provided, parents provided us this, this body, body, body. Where we are born, how we are, how

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.000
 we are.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.490
 We are completely in cover with anything. We are, we can say, well, if it's life, it's not really

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.000
 active life.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 If it's dead, crying, not dead, crying, crying.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 What we can tell, what we can tell, what we can do, except crying, crying.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 That time, a parent throw out. We are gone. We are completely helpless.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 But they held up their two palms with great love, great joy, great appreciation.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Holding their hand and give us life. They didn't let us to die there.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Give us this breath continually and great. That is known as kindness of giving the lives.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.320
 And now, we have this, of course, this is just a highlight of kindness. There are so many other

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.000
 things.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Now, they are growing. And they provide all necessary things, whatever we need.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.810
 They help and support. They went, went to the, what's called, kids are us, boys are us, kids are us

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.000
, boys are us.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 With joy, with happy. Oh, what is good for my kids? What is that? Really?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And spending money, even the shortage of budget, all this, they are kind of buying things.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 It's true. All the necessary things. And action figures, ninja turtles, ninja turtles.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 All the, these are the treasure for them, for us.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 They are three, not just ninja turtle, they are truly so important.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.600
 And all the people selecting, what is the surface of things, what is good things, selecting those

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.000
 things.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.480
 They provided us all those necessary things. That's called kindness of providing kindness,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.000
 providing all things.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.890
 And for this, they show us all, gradually teaching, how to act, how to do, how to tell, even how to

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.000
 go to the bathroom too.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 What's called, port, porta? Party train. What? Party train. Yeah, party trains.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And even they show you party trains, and when the party train success, but they clap in hand.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 You did so wonderful, you did so sweet. I'm not kidding, dear.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 This is all known as kindness. This is all kindness.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 This is not just done by only our parents, these times.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 We are parents, we are doing that to our children. And our parents did that too.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.590
 All the sentient beings, parents are doing every best to their capabilities, of the best

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.000
 capabilities.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.500
 That's why, in the Buddha teaching, he said, all sentient beings, all parent sentient beings, they

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.000
 are so, so kindness.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Therefore, we need body to shine, love and kindness, compassion.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.780
 A cord of best cover, wishing them two good things. Really good things. Pray, doing whatever we can

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.000
 do. That is.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So that is really about the samsara levels, how kindness.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 And the dharmak level, without the parent, we won't have the 18 endowments.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 18 endowments is the vehicle to reach enlightenment.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.520
 Without the 18 endowments, you can read those. In the words of my perfect teacher, have those. Many

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.000
 of you know.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Without that, how we can have first place to start spiritual journey, spiritual practices.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.120
 Then, beside that, in the dharma level, in the dharma level, without the parent sentient beings,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.000
 how we can start six paramata practices.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Without the parent beings, we cannot practice first three paramata at all.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.530
 Though, it is incomplete paramata. Therefore, there are so many levels, parents are so kind, so

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.000
 spiritual.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 For that reason, in the Buddha teaching, always said, parents are important.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Our one story in the teaching said, there is one in the Buddha's time, Buddha's student.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:23.890
 And one young boy entered into the monastery, and the Buddha is a sangha member, and he was a very

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.000
 good student.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.400
 He started, and he has really good knowledge and understanding of all three pitakasas, such as Vin

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.000
aya, Abhidhana, and all that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 And also, he maintained very beautiful moralities, too.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 So, the parents are very happy, and the father is very happy.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.870
 And then, when parents become older, mother died, and the father thought, "Oh, maybe I should

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.000
 become the monk, too.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 My son is really well. Well, I like to become monk."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And so, he joined as a monastery, he became monks.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 And now, father was a little old, old, old.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.490
 And then, in the opening of the Buddha teaching, he said, "Of course, helping to the parent is very

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.000
 important."

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.140
 So, then, here's a little bit sometimes, a couple of Philharmonic ladies to go to have the lunch

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.000
 outside,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.630
 and also, begging, begging, and so, one time, he told his father, "Son, I think you should really

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.000
 bring food to me."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 He said, "You should bring food to me."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 And son said, "How can lime can serve to the fox?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 How can lime can serve the fox?"

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So, and then father said, "Who is lime? Who is fox?"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 So, his son said, "I am lime."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.730
 And because Buddha said, "Whoever has the knowledge, and keep the vows and knowledge, they are like

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.000
 lions.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 So, I'm the lions, and who don't have that knowledge?"

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Buddha said, "They are just regular animals."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So, how can lime can serve to the fox?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 So, then father said, "Wow, that is really interesting."

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And a lady said, "Such a folk like father me produces such a lime like you."

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 That is interesting. That's interesting.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.650
 So, that debate went back and forth, kind of that, and it spread, and then, eventually, it came to

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.000
 the Buddha.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 The Buddha heard, and the Buddha called both of them, "Is this a true story or not?"

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 They said, "Yes, that's a true story. We started that. How did that happen?"

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And Buddha said, "Even the son has all those qualities and all these things.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Draphenity, parents, a parent helping you is very important.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Service to parent, particularly when they need it, need it, help it.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 It's marriage, always. Marriage is good. Good children."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 So, that's what the story started.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And then, a lot related with that, and then, one monk, monk is a really true story.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 I mean, the teachings said, "One monk, monk, in her metering, in meditating."

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And while he started meditating in that places,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and suddenly, monks bring so many food in the room.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So, now, he thought, "Why should I go to the city?"

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 "I should eat this food. This mouse brings so many food."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 So, he started using that, and not going to the city.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So, many sangha frontiers thought, "Why are you not going to eat food?"

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 "And food? Why don't you eat food?"

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 He said, "Because the mouse is bringing so many food."

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 But they all kind of made it. That's really interesting.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 They bring, and he has enough food to eat, and all these things.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.800
 So, then, they kind of made it and asked the Buddha, "Why is this happening? Why is this happening

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.000
?"

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 So, Buddha said, "In ancient times, this monk was the father of that mouse."

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 So, mouse is repaying the kindness of the parent.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:49.610
 So, mouse is the child or son of daughter, whatever, is bringing, paying the repair of the parent's

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.000
 kindness.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 So, that's the real story.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And then, another story, even Buddha is totally enlightened.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 But he went to hit heaven to repair his gratitude to his mother.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 According to the teaching, the Buddha passed away.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 The mother passed away seven days after Buddha's birth.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And she told the birth in the Tushit heavens.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And the Buddha went to pay that gratitude.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And that Buddha gave the teaching on a sutra of gratitude in the mother.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 That sutra of the Buddha gave that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 So, this is very important.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Both each other is so important, so special.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Without the both each other, there is no enlightenment.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 What is thinking of kindness, all sentences, we activate both each others.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And both each other is what?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Start with it, with it.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Wishing both each other and actualizing both each other.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Wishing both each other is for boneless, simply for boneless.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Love, boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy, and boneless economies.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Those are called boneless.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Okay, so I stop here today and hope we won't have a question today.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And next time we do questions and also thank you.
