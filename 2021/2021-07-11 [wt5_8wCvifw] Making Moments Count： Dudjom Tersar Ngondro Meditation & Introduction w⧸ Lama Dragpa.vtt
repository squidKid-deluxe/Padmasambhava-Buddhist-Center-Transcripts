00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 So again, thank you friends, thanks for coming, thanks for joining. It's always a great privilege

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.360
 to be able to gather together in person and then virtually to reflect on and discuss and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.320
 practice the Dharma. So this session is mainly going to be a meditation practice on the Dudjom

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.640
 Tersar Ngondro, with just right now a short little window of kind of some essential reminders.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.080
 And these are very honestly and realistically reminders to myself. I'm just a student and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.880
 Venerable Kempo Semandon Nurembiche has asked Lama Lai and myself to just help lead this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.720
 session when it's available, and so kind of feel like I'm just doing my best to try to

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.480
 fulfill that request of Venerable Kempo Rimbiche. So these really very actively are just for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 my own mind, reflecting on some of the important points that I've had the great opportunity

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:13.040
 to receive of Dharma. And so I think in one way, this is just kind of it's good to be

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.120
 upfront that we're just repeating these same words that we've heard, many of us have heard

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.320
 from these great noble living lineage masters, words taught by the Buddha, words preserved

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.000
 by this chain of lineage masters who took these same words, the same instructions, the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 same advice and looked into their mind and checked the truth of these words for themselves.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 And they really put the time in to mingle their mind with this inquiry, with this investigation,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.480
 which is what the Dharma asks all of us to do, is to really see for ourselves. In Pali

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 it's E I Pasiko, the Buddha said come see for yourself. This is what the Buddha discovered

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.600
 to be the truth of things. But we have to actually, in order to get much benefit from

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 that, we actually have to test those teachings, that advice for ourselves. So there's three

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.960
 general phases that are often referred to in Buddhism. There's the first phase when

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.000
 we come across the teachings of just intellectually investigating them. We develop, we kind of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 look at and inquire and analyze the teachings. We have the great fortune to receive teachings,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.920
 to listen to them, to read them, to connect with these noble living lineage masters. So

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.800
 this first step is just in getting a basic intellectual understanding of what the teaching

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.880
 is. And then as we continue, then we actually want to test this teaching to see the validity

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.400
 in our own experience, with our own mind. Is it helpful? Does it make me happier? Does

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 it make me kinder? And we test that. So as we test the teaching, we put it into practice

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.120
 little by little, drop by drop, day by day, and kind of accumulate, kind of refine this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.400
 kind of intellectual understanding. And we eventually have some kind of a glimpse of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:21.080
 an experiential insight. We get a little taste. Oh, this is true. So that's this experiential

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.360
 taste. It's a direct seeing, a direct perception or experience that, oh, for ourselves, this

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.960
 teaching actually is true. This is helpful. And then as we continue applying those instructions

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.060
 and those teachings, that what initially is a brief little window of experience becomes

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.180
 longer and longer. We become more and more familiar with the teaching. We line up how

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.800
 our habits are more with the actual nature of how things are as well. And that becomes

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.880
 more of a sustained realization. And so we go initially from just analytic understanding,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.560
 and then we apply it into a more of a taste and experiential direct experience of the validity,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.320
 the truth of the teaching. And then we actually start to sustain that. We start to mingle

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.760
 or absorb the teachings into our hearts through practice, through meditation, through this

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.880
 reflection, contemplation, meditation, until we become the Dharma. And so like the noble,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.120
 great kindness master, Buddha Shakyamuni, was completely mingled his entire being, body,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.840
 speech, and mind with the Dharma. And so he had sustained realization. And this context

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.500
 is called enlightenment. So little by little, drop by drop, we have to refine our concepts.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.000
 We remove the negative habits that are kind of keep us stumbling, make us feel down, make

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.800
 us feel fuzzier, lost, more confused, more stuck. We'd remove those, little by little,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.280
 and then we increase the good positive qualities we all have, these natural qualities of mind

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.960
 that we all have, this kindness, patience, ability to forgive, a sense of self worth,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.600
 that others are valuable, that the opportunity is precious and fleeting. Kind of these Dharma

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.320
 insights, these very powerful, profound insights, we start to bring out these good qualities

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.200
 that are naturally there. So we eliminate what was blocking those good qualities from

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.560
 being there, and then they just start shining out more and more brightly, these good habits.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.680
 And eventually, there's no more covering. There's no more veil. There's no more confusion.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.080
 There's no more habit. And we just become natural. And that's, we just kind of sustain

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.280
 more and more a state of being natural, of being what we really are. And so this is a

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.800
 Mahayana teaching that this inherent nature of all beings is as empty of being stuck or

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.960
 fixed in any way. And it's full of all these wonderful, infinite qualities of love, compassion,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.800
 sympathetic joy, equanimity, all these goodness qualities. So bodhicitta bursts out and just

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 becomes our natural, everyday, uninterrupted experience. So that's essentially the path.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.280
 We remove the negative habits, perform the positive habits, and then tame our mind, which

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.680
 in another way can be said to reveal the innate goodness of our mind, our fundamental nature,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.160
 which is beyond habits, even good habits. So that's the path. And I think it's good to

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.280
 remember, because I'm a sentient being, and maybe many people are sentient beings, that

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:50.440
 what we do is we wonder. One of the key definitions of the human realm is doubt. In one way that's

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.640
 interpreted by Ven. Kemper Rinpoche's in their book, Door to Inconceivable Wisdom and Compassion,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:03.840
 is we just doubt the truth of our experience. We get a taste that, oh, virtue leads to virtue.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.160
 If I'm kind to someone, kindness comes. If I don't get as angry, I'll feel better. Like

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.800
 these small little insights that are actually very significant. We doubt them. Oh, that

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.840
 just happened before. Maybe that's not true. So we basically kind of keep sabotaging our

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:32.400
 path towards virtue and our path towards naturalness. We just don't actually get certain about it.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.040
 We don't get clear about it, because we keep interrupting it with this doubt, this hesitation.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.120
 And so there's different degrees of teaching, and the teachings are vast and profound.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:57.360
 They're so deep. But in the end, we need to gain a certainty wisdom, unfailing doubt in

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.200
 the teaching, by testing the teachings for ourselves, by putting them into practice,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.160
 by really seeing for ourselves, by tasting the teaching again, by seeing the benefit

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.740
 of removing some bad habits, seeing the benefit of increasing positive habits. We really have

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:30.500
 to develop an unwavering conviction that this is true. And so this conviction has nothing

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.720
 to do with a typical fundamentalism that closes one's eye, where we don't test for ourselves.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.620
 We just close our eyes and have blind faith and hold on real hard. And everything has

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:52.240
 to fit in our box, or else we push it out. So this is the opposite of that. We're developing

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.900
 a certainty wisdom that just wants to include, to curiously investigate, to see what else

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.280
 is happening, to keep looking at the nature, at our experience, at our own mind, to try

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:11.980
 to keep looking, keep looking. And until we really see for ourselves again and again and

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:21.840
 again and again, this is true. And on the relative level, that just comes down to interdependence.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:30.840
 Everything comes together and eventually comes apart on the relative level. And on the absolute

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:39.560
 level of Buddha's two true teachings, there is an unchanging thread of awareness that

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:48.000
 can't be grasped. It has no fixed characteristics in any kind of a relative way, because it's

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.040
 not an object of experience. It doesn't stay put. It's the awareness that's always happening,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:02.600
 that sense of awareness that's unchanging. So these two parts, that everything is impermanent

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.620
 because everything comes together and is interwoven with cause and effect. And then secondly,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.900
 the absolute side of the awareness within which all of this arising and abiding and

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:22.880
 dissolving happens within these two parts, the relative and absolute, the changing, uninterrupted,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:31.000
 changing nature of all relative experience. And then the unfabricated, unchanging absolute

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.640
 nature of awareness. So these are these two components of the path that we have to really

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:44.960
 get a firm conviction about, an unwavering conviction. This is the truth. This is how

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:52.880
 this is. And just honestly speaking, in my little experience with Dharma, this takes

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:01.140
 a lot of time. We have to keep testing, keep looking, keep practicing. And a story, a metaphor

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.020
 that's really helped me again and again and again, it just keeps popping in my head over

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:11.500
 the years is this story is like kind of a, of just a person walking on a beach and all

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.940
 you see on this beach, there's all these starfish on the shore and they're just all getting

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.620
 baked in the sun and dying. And so it's like kind of heart wrenching for this person walking

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.500
 and they keep walking on the beach, all these hundreds of thousands of starfish, they're

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.400
 all dying and they come upon a person down the beach and this person is going one by

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.700
 one picking up starfish and throwing it back into the ocean. And then the person walking

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:45.620
 on the beach, what are you doing? There's no way you can help all these starfish. They're

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:54.820
 going to die. And then the person standing on the beach bends down, picks up a starfish,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:06.140
 throws it into the ocean. I helped that one. That every moment we put into our practice

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:18.940
 is a valuable, meaningful, vastly significant moment. But we just doubt it. We don't immediately

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.340
 see the benefit. We don't, we don't immediately see some big karmic consequence. Maybe we

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.140
 see a little benefit. Oh, we're a little more relaxed, a little more caring, a little more

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.980
 kind to ourselves, a little more kind to others. Then we keep trying to sustain this moment

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:42.020
 by moment, just these short little windows of practice. Doesn't have to be some big thing,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.660
 but just short little interruptions of how we think everything is just so stuck this

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.540
 way. I am this way. Life is this way. These little interruptions of like, Oh, maybe it's

00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:02.340
 not all this way. Maybe there's a little window of kind of some humor in the situation, a

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:09.900
 little fresh air, a little kind of sense of what if, Oh, maybe, maybe I don't know. Maybe

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:16.940
 something different could happen. A little curiosity and just moment by moment, these

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.020
 little windows. And that's the whole point of kind of engaging the teachings, whether

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.400
 we're reading the scriptures, memorizing the scriptures, transcribing the scriptures, or

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.800
 sitting down, doing formal meditation, a silent sitting meditation or a chanting meditation.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.580
 Then we're just constantly interrupting this tendency to doubt. We're like, we pull ourselves

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:47.260
 out of the situation and we look at ourselves experiencing and say, Oh, we keep bursting

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:54.180
 our own bubble. Instead of just letting ourselves be with the practice, be with the teaching,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.500
 we keep stepping outside and watching it. Oh, it's not really good enough. I'm not good

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.140
 enough. This isn't strong enough. I should do some other thing. Maybe there's another

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:10.780
 better practice. We kind of keep interrupting the moment. We keep popping ourselves outside

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:17.020
 of the moment. Let's say it's like taking two sticks to rub together to make a fire.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:23.940
 If we keep stopping the motion, then we'll never get enough friction to cause heat and

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.780
 never have a fire. Like it really does have to be an ongoing effort of moments and these

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:36.860
 moments build up and then we really do see this change for ourselves and our own experience.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:42.460
 Little by little and on a very, very practical way, this really comes down to just common

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:50.060
 sense. Like we've gone over some basic view and last time of the impact that our motivation

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:59.340
 has on our practice and the common sense teaching, the most outer everyday practical teaching

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:07.300
 the Buddha taught us is his four thoughts that turned the mind to the Dharma. We are

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:17.860
 essentially worthwhile, valuable, this precious human embodiment, each of us. It's unquestionable.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:26.140
 If we look at it closely, we'll come to see that is true. The second, impermanence. Everything

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:38.340
 is impermanent. The third, cause and effect. Good leads to good, bad leads to bad. It's

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.140
 cause and effect. It doesn't really need a big explanation. There's so many teachings

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:50.020
 but cause and effect. And then samsara. When we grab onto part of a moving system and we

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:56.060
 hold onto it wishing it stays in place, it starts to drag us around and it's suffering.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:04.100
 We feel the burn of getting pulled around by our own grasping. The samsara is dissatisfying.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.900
 It's uncertain. We want to hold it and make it certain so there's not that sense of dis-ease

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.220
 or insecurity. So we try to lock it in place and it refuses to lock in place because it's

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:20.260
 impermanent and then we get pulled by it, by experience, by our emotions, by our thoughts,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:27.500
 by what's happening outside. These four thoughts are the most practical level, common sense.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:34.180
 They don't require really much logical investigation. It's just their basic default views of almost

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:41.140
 every being, like every human being. We just keep not trusting them. So that's why the

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:46.340
 Buddha really strongly encouraged us to test for ourselves. Look at the preciousness of

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:52.700
 our situation. And remember that. Have that be a lived experience every moment or impermanence.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.900
 This is impermanent. As it happens, it's going. So we shouldn't waste our time on things that

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.720
 really aren't so meaningful. Cause and effect. If we do these good things, if we have a more

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.360
 relaxed state of mind, that habit becomes stronger if we keep doing it over time. Similarly,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.660
 if we're avoiding a bad habit, we stop ourselves from doing something that's not as destructive.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.700
 It doesn't help us. It doesn't make us happy. It doesn't make others feel good and relaxed

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.720
 around us. We stop doing that and gradually that habit weakens until we're just not interested

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:37.380
 in it so much anymore. This cause and effect. And then samsara is suffering. It's unfixable.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.940
 We should do whatever we can to make other beings happy, to like care for them, to care

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.540
 for ourselves. We should do anything and everything we can that's within our power, our means,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.980
 our understanding with what's available with others, their readiness. But we'll never fix

00:17:52.980 --> 00:18:02.660
 it. Samsara will always be suffering. Grasping mind will always be tinged by suffering, the

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:10.380
 truth of pervasive suffering. It's just how grasping mind works. And so we do whatever

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.960
 we can to ease our own minds and to ease the minds of others. We put so much energy into

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.780
 that as bodh, like taking a bodhisattva bow, that becomes our path. All we're trying to

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:28.700
 do is relieve others, help a little bit, little bit and bit by bit starfish by starfish, drop

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.080
 by drop. These moments build up and they become more prolonged experiences. And then it becomes

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:44.440
 more of a stable way that we're constantly engaging our life over time. I find just for

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:52.540
 myself again and again, it's really important to recognize two sides of this. One, every

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:59.580
 moment counts. Every little bit makes a big difference because it's karma, cause and effect.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:06.300
 Every moment has impact because it's infinitely intermingled with all the other things happening,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.940
 all the other moments of mind, all the other moments of physical interaction. It's all

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:20.900
 interrelated. So everything counts. And at the same time, to really see a significant

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:28.900
 impact in changing our habits over time, we really have to keep putting the moments in.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.700
 We really do. That's just, it's just a very practical thing. Otherwise it's like Lama

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:42.180
 Chi Mei, Rinpoche's father. He said, he joked, "Oh, if we just have a rainbow mouth, not

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:49.620
 rainbow heart, we just talk nice. We can say, oh, everything's impermanent and it's all

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.620
 of divine mandala and everything's free and easy and it's all already fine." It's so easy

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:03.020
 to say those things. It's so easy to say those things. But to actually have that really absorb

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:09.820
 in our hearts and mingle that with our minds all the time, it really takes sustained effort

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:15.420
 over time. And everything we put into it will actually bring about that result because cause

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:24.700
 and effect. That cause will never be lost. But to really have our mind be tamed to change,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.500
 to have those habits be smoothened out so that then there's a little window of opening where

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:35.060
 we don't doubt our nature anymore. We just let ourselves be natural. And then our Buddha

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:42.100
 nature just shines. Because the negative habits are so strong, it really takes time to smooth

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:48.300
 out, to have the positive habits come fresh, and then just to finally relax and just let

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.980
 our minds and our bodies and our speech just naturally do what they do. Their enlightened

00:20:53.980 --> 00:21:01.620
 nature just shines out. So that's just a brief thing I thought to mention. I didn't really

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:08.540
 have any time to prepare this today. So that's my kind of random rambling. But the basic

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:16.540
 point is really every moment does count. And the moments build up to really big effects.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.860
 And so if we want to see a big result in our practice, we have to be very practical. Put

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.660
 the moments in. Short little moments. And then we change our mind. We just pause and

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:36.820
 refresh. Pause, refresh. Open, grounded, sensitive to others, caring, kind. These great noble

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.140
 beings like you can see that as these great masters get older, so many of them just become

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.460
 so sweet and kind. You can, I've seen this a little bit in my experience. Maybe when

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:52.300
 they're a little younger, a little more vigorous, they're a little more sharp cutting. Depends

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:58.460
 on the master. Clear this away. Eliminate this obstacle. Eliminate this. Just get everything

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:04.660
 lined up. And then these masters become so sweet. Oh, you do. Do one Moni, one Moni,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:12.100
 just one. They don't say a million. Because every little thing counts, every little bit.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:19.700
 And so we have to play both sides. One, every Moni mantra really counts. The provisional

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:26.380
 teachings say that really can give such vast benefit. One moment of reflecting on the permanence

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:32.720
 has such an almost nearly infinite positive impact. But at the same time, we need to keep

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.020
 putting, having those moments happen. We need to keep reflecting on impermanence, on preciousness,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.980
 on cause and effect, on samsara. And with this ground, then we'll stay on the path, the path

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:49.620
 of not doubting our own goodness. The goodness of others will actually eliminate that unhealthy

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:56.040
 doubt which closes us down and leads us away from the nature. And instead, we'll really

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.060
 brightly, clearly shine this certainty wisdom that's free of doubt. The nature is what it

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:09.060
 is. You and me are fundamentally good. And there's a path in actually having this goodness

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:14.540
 come out more and more reliably all the time that enlightenment is possible and beings

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:20.100
 have done it. And now is my opportunity to walk this same path and see for myself the

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.200
 benefits that come from that. And offer that kindness and generosity to others. Make their

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.740
 lives just a little better. Give them a little more support so they can relax into their own

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:36.460
 goodness too. So drop by drop, we do that together. And these are kind of the point

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.220
 of these practice sessions, just to kind of reconnect, have a little window where we're

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.720
 kind of supporting each other. And doing that kind of based on our own limitations, but

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.560
 putting in the time little by little and the result will be, according to all the sutras

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.620
 and tantras, just amazingly powerful, impactful, and wonderful. We'll see that at some point

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.200
 along the path. We'll have the clarity of mind, the certainty wisdom will be strong

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.720
 enough where we'll see the karmic result in our own experience and look back on these

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:15.920
 times now and so genuinely rejoice that we took these moments to do this dharma activity.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.040
 We'll be just overwhelmingly happy that we put this time and now for ourselves and for

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.880
 others. So thank you all so much. We'll do a short silent meditation. And then we'll

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.760
 continue here with the dudram terra sartanandra sadhana practice. This again the session will

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:41.840
 go till 5.15. And then so in about a little hour, hour and 10 minutes. So we'll begin

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:55.200
 at the beginning. And this dudram terra sartanandra begins on page 12 with the seven line prayer.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:20.880
 And then due to time constraint, let's see. Yeah. We'll go through everything. Great. Thank

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:34.960
 you.
