 noble ones. And it is called the tambasam, beginning noble, middle noble, and

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.160
 concluding nobles. So beginning noble is, again with those beautiful intentions, good

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 motivation, good thought, bodhicitta, and devotion, strongly in our heart and mind,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.960
 feels the connection. Devotion is so important to achieve the realization of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 the dharma. Really in the teachings, but because devotion makes what? Makes close

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.080
 to us, to the teachings. Makes close. When we have the devotion, there's no

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.640
 skeptical. There's no doubt in hesitations. Skeptical, no doubt in

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.560
 the hesitation is that sometimes we need when we are starting intellectually

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.840
 levels. But when we practicing, that means we settle now. We're going to engage

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.080
 deeply, and like to become that, like to become as a Gaurapayama sambhava, like to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.720
 achieve like the Gaurapayama sambhava, achieve. And we have some doubt and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:13.200
 skeptical and practice. That practice is not so pure. If I use the word, it's maybe

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.480
 a 10% or maybe good, but 80% we spoiled. 90% spoiled because the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.000
 skeptical, because the doubt and hesitation. But when we are at one point in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.760
 devotions, that means we have courage and confidence, commitment, and embracing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.960
 that teaching with feeling of preciousness. Teaching is precious. Teaching is not

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.760
 just okay. Oh, it's just okay, maybe. And we have that okay thought. Maybe it's good

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.520
 sometimes. But dharma, when we practice, we really spoil our practice and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:06.120
 meditation. It's not okay. It's okay, it's not okay. Okay, have to be 100%. This is,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.400
 this is what it is. Really feel confidence, courage,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.760
 fearlessness, and then embracing the teaching. Then true wisdom comes.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.320
 Blessings will come. Great Master Gaurapayama sambhava said to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.960
 kings of the dead. We have the one point in the mind, those people who have the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:40.320
 one point in mind and practice, that individually will propel all the wishes.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.640
 One point in mind and practices, propels all the wishes. Read the life story of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.960
 the Malarepa. His determination and courage and commitment practices

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.760
 Malareka become the one of the great enlightened beings. Read the life story of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 Loonjimba. Loonjimba did not practice with lingering thought and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.080
 sculpturally, intellectually, and doubt and hesitations. After he received the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.760
 teaching, he practiced the one point. He even made commitment to his teacher,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.320
 Komaranza, that I will make the practice as your offering to you. And

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.360
 Loonjimba becomes as like the second Gaurapadhoji because of that. It's not by the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.920
 because lingering in a skeptical thought and doubt and hesitation. Loonjimba

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.520
 becomes Loonjimba. No. Loonjimba becomes as Loonjimba because of his courage, his

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.400
 commitment, his loyalty. Practice that. And not just Loonjimba and Malarepa. All

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.920
 those great masters, we read life story and we say, we pulled in hand and said

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.100
 good and all the things because of their determination, their devotions, their

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.120
 joyful effort. When you have the respect, devotions, and courage and commitment, joy,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.240
 then joyful effort comes naturally. The laziness cannot defeat, even the laziness

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:28.680
 cannot come close to those persons. Persons, they're truly winners. Winner. And that is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 really with those beautiful devotions, thoughts, and then have these strong

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.480
 presence of that and then develop that closeness feeling to the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.040
 Buddha Dharma Sangha and Gaurabha Masambhava and generate in the bodhisattva

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 with these devotions and then joined in the prayers. Prayers, those of the
