00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 The teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni, meaning that behind you, we all, or you all, have this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.920
 beautiful human body with it, freedom, and a laughter spot.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.880
 So how do you get your governance in the most hard work?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:25.210
 And then you are engaging in the part of the Buddha's teaching and not just only that, the most

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.080
 precious teaching that which is very helpful.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 And those of you who are interested or have the desire to reach enlightenment or gain the knowledge

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.320
 of the wisdom within this lifetime.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.470
 And therefore that, those of us, is very important to protect the Samayas, group Samayas, and brand

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.600
 Samayas are necessary to protect them.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.720
 Here you can see that the Samayas, which you can see here, were the same as the Samayas.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.800
 So you can see that the Samayas were also the same as the Samayas.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:15.290
 So if you didn't observe or protect the Samayas, then it's also similar as that we were searching

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.040
 for the medicine, but then you ended up with the poison.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:37.530
 In order to maintain the Samaya, what we need for the Samayas and for the world, to protect the Sam

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.720
ayas, then we need devotion.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.640
 We need a joyful effort, help, and intelligence of the Western.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:59.670
 So we are trying to ignite the devotion, ignite the joyful effort, ignite the intelligence of the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280
 Western.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:17.530
 And first, again, the very teachers taught more. Why we need devotion? Because if we don't have the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.960
 devotion, then you are not at all the results of the very inner teaching, or that will come.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:35.110
 There is no, that's it, that very inner teaching, not going to sink or search. Search to that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.160
 individuals.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.250
 If we don't have that, then why we need joyful effort? If we don't have joyful effort, then we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.960
 become the laziness and carry with it the old habit practice.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 All habit practice completely, our power, as always. So therefore, joyful effort is so necessary.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:16.120
 And then, why we need the wisdom? If we don't have the wisdom, we won't understand the profound and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.760
 the mystical meanings of the very honest world and their characteristics.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 And we don't can't distract them.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 [Hindi]

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.310
 And for that reason, one way where the inner teaching is the teaching for those who have the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.360
 devotion, joyful effort, and the intelligence of the Western.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 [Hindi]

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.280
 When you have those three things, whoever have that three things, then where the inner teaching is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.330
 the teaching for them, that it will activate it and bring the full growth and the development of

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.960
 the practices.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:18.560
 [Hindi]

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:28.960
 And therefore, then particularly, when you give the teachings of the very inner teaching, that

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.760
 teacher should see as Buddha, and then do three in these ways.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:05:05.360
 [Hindi]

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:14.560
 And therefore, then opening the teachings, throughout the teachings, on all the teachers, there is

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.460
 the teacher of the very inner teaching.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:33.550
 And then, some teaching also said, "Bhagavam sambhava" is the teacher for all the devotees, devote

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.460
es they use.
