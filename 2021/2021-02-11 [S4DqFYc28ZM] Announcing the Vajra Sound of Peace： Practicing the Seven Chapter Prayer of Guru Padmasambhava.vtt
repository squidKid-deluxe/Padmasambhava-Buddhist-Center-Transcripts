Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPadma Samye Ling\nFebruary 10, 2021\n\nVajra Sound of Peace:\nPracticing the Seven Chapter Prayer of Guru Padmasambhava\n\nby  Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\nand  Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\u2022\nThe Seven Chapter Prayer is one of the most renowned practices in Tibetan Buddhism. It condenses and embodies all the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni into a single practice. Since its discovery by the great terton Rigdzin Godemchen in the 14th century, it has been regarded as one of the most essential and powerful ways to practice on Guru Padmasambhava. This Seven Chapter Prayer practice is popular in the Nyingma school, as well as in the Kagyu and Sakya schools. Because of its immense popularity, many Seven Chapter Prayer lineages have developed. In particular, there is the Northern Treasures lineage in which the teaching itself originated. Later, the great scholar and siddha Karma Chagme condensed the teachings and practices of all the Seven Chapter Prayer lineages, and it is his commentary that we are following.\n\u2022\nAll the great masters of Tibetan Buddhism have said that Guru Padmasambhava is the Buddha of the Degenerate Age. During this present time, he is the sole protector and refuge for all sentient beings. When we connect to Guru Padmasambhava, we\u2019re connecting to all enlightened beings throughout space and time.\n\u2022\nThe Seven Chapter Prayer unites devotion, bodhichitta, and Dzogchen meditation in the form of a Guru Yoga practice on Guru Rinpoche. As the great master Karma Chagme said, absolute Guru Padmasambhava is the innate nature of mind, and the innate nature of the mind is the innate nature of everything. In order to fully realize this, we need to increase our devotion, joy, and bodhichitta. Then we visualize and supplicate Guru Padmasambhava with practices like the Seven Chapter Prayer, and we complete everything by resting in Dzogchen meditation and then dedicating the merit for our families, friends, and all living beings. This is the way to achieve enlightenment. It is how we can increase our inner beauty and let it shine to the world.\n\u2022\nIn honor of the ten year Anniversary of the Mahaparinirvana of Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche (1938-2010), we are delighted to publish the line-by-line commentary on the Seven Chapter Prayer given by the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches at Padma Samye Ling in 2010, which includes detailed practice instructions for each of the seven chapters according to the vajra speech of Khedrub Karma Chagme.\n\u2022\nThis book includes the entire Tibetan and English of the root text, as well as Khedrub Karma Chagme\u2019s commentary in Tibetan.\n\u2022\nNote: According to the Inner Tantras, as well as the great master Khedrub Karma Chagme, it is necessary and important that you first receive a Guru Padmasambhava empowerment from a qualified lama before you practice the Seven Chapter Prayer.\n\u2022\nCasebound Hard Cover | Full Color\nDharma Samudra | 1/1/21\nPages: 510 | Size: 6 x 9\nISBN: 978-1-7335411-6-9\n\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org/chiso/books-by-khenpo-rinpoches/seven-chapter-prayer-commentary-vajra-sound-of-peace",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
 The Seven Chapter Prayer of Guru Padmasambhava is written in numerous schools. Every one of them is

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.000
 written.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 I think I can't believe it, and also I am going to be with him, as always.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I have been teaching many years ago, before he entered Mahaparinirvana.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Five years ago, or three, four years before, that he gave the teaching,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and particularly also followed, with very famous master of many of you know, Karma Chagme.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 His explanation and commentary is on the seven chapters that he taught.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 He saw extensively something that extra only.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 He is teaching that maybe not many new masters did before,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 and he, though on cost, really did taught on how to meditate and practice these seven chapters.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 So can you use that?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And so this is now a long time, so many years,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 walking hard by so many people, particularly Lama Chapa,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 and then all others, and Amandar, and Alaya, and really everyone put so much effort,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 and God is beautiful, but really, I am so happy. Thank you.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Thank you so much.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Thank you very much.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 (Singing)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Everyone would ask her to support it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And then I did Lama Chapa, thank you so much.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And then of course, Anna did this layout in Russia,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 and now since last year, though, quite a few books now.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 She really did books. She really did.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 She's fast, and she dialed out everything, so thank you.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 She did all. Thank you.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Thank you, everyone, and Lama Loring, and all the women, really.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 All the support and help to come this far.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Thank you. Lama Chapa, you've got so much effort.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Yes. Really.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And this...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 All the energy.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 What?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 All the energy.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Energy. And proofreading, because I don't know too much about before,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 but this year, or last year, I understood my two books when I was walking.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Really, I see how much things you need to put effort.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 I put so many efforts, and they don't help me so much, really.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 We're putting kind of hours on this proofreading,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 and all this going on and on and on.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 So thank you.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Oh, I love this. It's really good, huh?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Yes.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Also, it's really...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 I mean, I said, it's quite heavy, but it's substantial, it's heavy, too.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 It's heavy, every aspect.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 This is like what they call in the Tibet, the Lama.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Lama, maybe it's dangerous, it's heavy.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Heavy, so it's heavy.
