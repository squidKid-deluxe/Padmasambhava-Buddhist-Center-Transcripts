00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 This is what Anakriti said, that when you are now meditating, when we say we meditate,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 when we say that, who is meditating?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 So when you look to your mind or ask your mind to question, who is meditating?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 There is no answer. And that's called speak less. Speak less.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 When you look to that, you ask when you look to searching that inquiry, when you are trying to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 search,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 search what you point. There is nothing to point.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 That is the teaching of the nature of the mind. That is really the nature of the mind.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And then he said, we mingle our mind with the nature of the Guru's mind.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Guru's mind. That is in the teaching said, as for example,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Viribhav Masambha, now who is important and all teachers, dissolved and become in the space

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 and it merged to your heart center. That means actually with your own nature of the mind.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 According to Buddhism, the mind, the principal location of the mind or the residence of the place

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.000
 to stay

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 of the mind is really hard. The space in mind is the principal, that is his mind's principal

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.000
 residence.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 But then in the brain, of course, secondly, his offices, his or her offices.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It is like working offices. The brain is working offices and the heart is the last sequence.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 So we need that merge that the Guru Masambha, the sphere of life, what we visualize,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 it merged to now your heart with your own nature of the mind or to your mind.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 It merged to your mind. That merging is known as merging the mind of the Guru

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 and the practitioners. That is what you visualize, what you meditate.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And then now, when you say the same thing, again, when you think, what is merging,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 what is the mind, there is no, nothing that we can say anything.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 That is really the nature. What it relates to the teacher of the Buddha said,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 inexpressible, inconceivable. That is inconceivable status.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 This is not inconceivable status by the wisdom, but then what in the teaching said,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 harsutta, pristine cognition, one's own awareness, can see.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 But not by the conception of the brain, that we see.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 No, it is beyond. You understand a little bit? Okay.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 But this realization, generally, this is really in the teaching said,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 realization of the true nature of the mind is not just going to come by the intellectuals

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 or by anything. But of course, intellectual will help.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 That's why it was made as a wisdom of the studying,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 a wisdom of the contemplations, a wisdom of the meditation,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 and all that kind of goes one after another. It will help.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 But actually, it really, realization comes by the true.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And that is known as devotion and merit.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 That true will really come. And then along with that merit,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 that means it's a compensation activities.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 That combined two, for that reason, and for that reason, here also said,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 here, again, in the aspect, you say it many times here.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Okay. This is not just going to come easily, kind of like that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 But once you got that glimpse of that understanding,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 glimpse of that understanding of what we're talking now,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 intellectually talking, that is good understanding.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 If you continually abide that state with the devotion,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 with the bodhicata, with the merit practices,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 merituri practices, and then it's all combined.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Merituri practices also know something completely different.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 It's also really part of the nature. So all that is supported, then all comes.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 For that reason, what the great Master Sarai said, I think,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 we heard many times from him, which he, I suppose, said a few times.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I'll show you from other great Masters too.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 The realization is welcomed only by the devotion and merituri activities.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 That is really the principle condition to boost or to bring realization.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Otherwise, there is no any other alternatives to gather realization

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 in the teaching center, no any other alternatives.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 I mean, that's what Sarai said.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 [Hindi]

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 It is really to have to do, to accumulate merit

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 that will purify the obscurations and by the blessings of the lineage

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 that will shine the realization.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 If you're thinking something else, you're diluting yourself.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 That's what Sarai said.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.840
 - Okay.
