00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.300
 I am very honored and happy to announce the arrival of His Eminence Namkha Drimed Rinpoche.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.500
 He is one of the great masters of the Nyongma schools of Advaita Buddhism in this time,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 and he was also recognized by the KIT party here in Rinpoche.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.250
 He will discover that. I and all the members of the Padma Samye Buddhism are very happy and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.000
 delighted with all that event.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 So this time, we will cause them to, if they can make the time, to come to Padma Samye Ling

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 and give the teachings and the involvement of the Guru Padma Sambha,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 according to the lineage of the great Tertons Taksha Nudin Dorji.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Taksha Nudin Dorji was one of the great Tertons in the Nyongma Buddhist history,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 and it is also to make a special connection to this great Terton,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and as well as to receive the teachings directly from the principal lineage holder of Taksha Nudin,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 His Eminence Namkha Drimed Rinpoche.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 That all is happening in August 26th, 6th on Friday, Friday.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So if anybody can make the time to come and make this connection,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 and it will be really wonderful, any of these beautiful, rich land,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 upstate of the New York and Padma Samye.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So I am very grateful and thankful to accept our accursed by His Eminence,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 and then coming to these places and bless to all of us.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 So I am very thankful, and I hope you can make some time for this special event

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 and join together to receive the teachings and blessings from this great Master.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Thank you very much.
