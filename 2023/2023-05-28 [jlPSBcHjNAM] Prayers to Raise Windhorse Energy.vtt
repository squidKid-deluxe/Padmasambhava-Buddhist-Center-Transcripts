00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 In Ongurvan Masambhava, all Gurus, Deva, and Dakit, and Kuesa, all these rise in front of our sky,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.000
 all with this monastery of temples, and then we do this prayer, to pray and guide all these prayers

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.000
,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.440
 and we sing very good things to everyone, really, of course, our salt, and all our friends,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.000
 the family, fellow country person, as well as whole world, which really there's more peace,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 more harmonics, more respect to each other, and everybody should enjoy what they have.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And really, we think that, I mean, this is not a quote, what we get, that we try to kind of like,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 with the competition, with the negative emotions, and trying to grab things, this and that,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.200
 and then kind of, I'm right, you're wrong, all those lead so much troubles, so many difficulties in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
 this life,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.380
 all that we see, but then according to Buddha teaching, it brings more difficulty challenges in the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.000
 future,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 next life, and the next after, that's the karma, negative karma, creating whole world,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.820
 and completely polluted, completely environment, and then also our mental state, so it's really bad

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.000
.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 But what we can do, do some prayers, and good heart, and we sing every good thing,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 every whatever we do, it really means peace, and happiness, and joy, and appreciation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Now, in the future, they all get enlightenment, remove all the obscurations,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and negative habits, and it's really reaching, I think this is what we can do,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 for the world peace, and for ourselves, and it is really a quote of Buddha teaching,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 and teaching of _____ is so powerful, and very, very targeted, and that really is the best.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 So, with all those we were told, and now we feel the presence of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Guru, Deva, and Raghini, all the linear masters, Buddha, Modi, Sato, Dharma, Para, Kesa,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 and everyone is here to compartmental, to bless, to support us, to propel our wishes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.350
 So, we'll have those thoughts, and then we do this prayer, and then we do a little of what's called

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.000
 consecrated.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Again, one more time, we just throw some rice offerings.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 So that means, when we throw in this rice, it's not just, of course, we're throwing,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 but in reality, we can think that all the Buddhas, Modi, Sato, and Guru, Deva, Raghini,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Dharma, Para, they are covering ground to compartmental our wishes,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 and bless these places, areas, and temple, and entirely in a world and country.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 That's really the means of this prayer.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So, having those all, we're taught and extended our heart and mind more broadly, not restricted.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 So, we've seen good things to everyone, okay?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000

 (Singing in foreign language)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 So what do you have right in your hand? Don't throw all in one time. And try to be very economic.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 (Laughter)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Very economic.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 So first I'm going to do it this way. And we do it in one giant.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And then second we press into the east and we're going to giant and throw this right.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And then to the rest.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 And then to do it on our way with the arkley is with the rest of the soul.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 So I think we can say the whole word is rest.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Rest. And that means Monastry is like what? Ourself is kind of like a principle.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 So both us and all bodies are right in front of us, right above us.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 So they're just turning every direction.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So direction is our direction of the heart, not yoga or Africa.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And then we go to the west and then north now and then we throw that.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And once that is completed, we come back here and stand there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Again, really you have some rights. And then we throw the ark because again.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.250
 And then you can, slowly you can go through. And this flower or destroying the life is not just a

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.000
 real turn through.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 But all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, enlightenment beings and lineage masters, dharma-palas,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 and all the gods and the Dakas and Dakinis, shower and dong.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 All the flowers of the auspiciousness and harmony, peace and joy,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.760
 spread our pleasure and then spread out whole as a ripple or the chain of light went throughout the

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.000
 world and the universe.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So extend it again. Again, extend our heart and meditation as much as you can without any boundary

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 is good in the Kiki set.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Okay.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Thank you.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Thank you.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Thank you.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Thank you.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Thank you.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Thank you.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Thank you.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Thank you.
