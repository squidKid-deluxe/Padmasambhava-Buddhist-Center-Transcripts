00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
 With the object, there are also two meditations. Object, object meditation, or I am using that

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.560
 terminology, maybe yesterday I used it as the character states.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 Shamatha meditation with the character states of "out" and "in" and Shamatha meditation with no

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 character states or no object. So these two.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.950
 And yesterday we discussed about Shamatha meditation of the character states or object. Yes, that

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.760
 has two. "Out" and "in".

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.590
 It's not something that you have to do that, but that if you use those techniques well to settle

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.600
 the mind, which even you can prefer, it's not something that you have to do all of these things.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 You can choose and apply these things. So since this we are talking about this Maha Mudra and which

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.480
 is always emphasized of the "Hammata" and "Vipashana" union of that, so therefore I am going to

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360
 highlight of these things.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.240
 So now we talk, I have mentioned about "Out", outer objects. Now we talk inner objects. Inner

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 objects also can be many things, but it is again, yes, top two now.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 And that is, for example, first inner object is with breathing and without breath or with other

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.240
 techniques.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.210
 With breathing and again it is the same position, the same thing as we discussed yesterday and you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.280
 know of that.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.220
 And with good postures, seven postures to the Buddha Veroa channels or whatever you are in good

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.410
 postures, relaxing in that status and then now keep the normal breathing, nothing changes about the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.280
 breathing, but keep the normal breathing and you start following the breathing.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 Gradually we are going to breathe out and in, out and in, just as follows that. When breathing is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.280
 going out, the thoughts follow with breathing, without.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 When breathing comes in, inhale and thoughts are coming, we breathe inward.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.650
 And the teaching said, kind of like breathing goes like this much far or maybe half meters or

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.280
 whatever this is, about this, this distance.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.720
 I mean this is just roughly measurement that it goes. And that is going in and out, you simply

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 follow breathing with the "as" thought or "as" breathing thoughts and that is one.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.200
 And again that thought becomes too much restless and too difficult and then start counting the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.280
 breathings.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:59.200
 Breathing in, again out and in as one or out in one, in two, out again count that one, two, three,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 five, ten, whatever you call it.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 Follow the breathing and counting the breathings.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.280
 In a view that means you are concentrating now, now your mind with breathing, with counting both,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 both together, definitely that will help to settle the mind, settle the mind.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.550
 Again, as we discussed yesterday, what will become perfect, good shamatha? Perfect shamatha, we

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.280
 need concentration first.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.210
 To show concentration, optimal concentration, we are concentrating in this case with breathing all

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.280
 the concrete.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 That is really mind is following, instead wondering different directions.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:56.140
 We are regulating mind. We are regulating mind. We are putting mind in rhythm, not restless, not

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.280
 convoluted, without any regulations, randomly doing everything.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.280
 We are regulating that. That is known as displaying, displaying the mind.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.520
 One Buddha said, "Tame your mind." This is where timing the mind, timing the mind, displaying the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.280
 mind.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:30.280
 So this is known as the shamatha meditation with the characteristic of the object, with the inward.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:41.690
 And then there is another shamatha meditation, which is known as the vulnerable object meditation

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.280
 inwardly.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:53.700
 Inwardly also concentrating something novel, I mean novel object, concentrating with the novel

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.280
 object inward, the shamatha.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.180
 That is, again, there are many different techniques, but we use Buddha's image, such as in our

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.280
 heart center.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 There are beautiful lotus flowers, ad vedal lotus flowers, beautiful.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.140
 In the middle of the ad lotus flowers, there is then Buddha Shaktamuni is residing, residing as

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.280
 golden color, same color as we concentrated yesterday, or to explain the outside, what is Buddha.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:35.540
 Saying that Buddha inwardly, and as we know, Buddha is calm, soothing, peaceful, radiating, Buddha

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.280
 is meditating.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.280
 Buddha is generally always in the teaching, you see.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.280
 When you reach enlightenment, there is no difference between post-meditation and meditation status,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 always in the natural status, not out of the natural.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:57.800
 So therefore, it is always Buddha within that status, and calm and peaceful, and concentrating to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.280
 put back to that Buddha, Buddha, and keeping that again.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.770
 And during that time, again, if mind goes away, of course it will go away, this is natural. Again,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:21.280
 you have to bring back. As soon as you notice, as that moment, bring back mind to that status.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:30.660
 Keep doing this, again and again, again and again. And then, my buried mind will become calm and

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:38.280
 peaceful. That is known as chamakas, calm and abiding status here.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.750
 In the great masters he says, I mean these texts, texts, and he said, you should apply those

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.280
 techniques.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.280
 He said he is going to make it roughly really there, apply all these techniques.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:04.680
 Once you have had this certainty, kind of like very stable status, then it will bring the chamakas

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.280
 meditation without object, without characteristics.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:25.280
 That is the true chamakas meditation. True. Without any disturbances, now you are able to maintain.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:34.570
 Our mind is now tamed, beautiful. And that chamakas meditation is, already I mentioned, this name

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:41.280
 is known as without characteristics, or without any object.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:52.680
 This time, now you are not really focusing anything, tonally, except resting now. Resting. And

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.280
 resting and relaxing that, without any things.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:07.570
 This time, generally, chamakas meditation, or vipassana meditation, or the mahamudra meditation and

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.280
 zukti meditation, now almost the same.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:20.800
 There is nothing really big difference. It is calm, peaceful, and it is abiding, it is natural

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.280
 status.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:32.570
 This is now the beginning of the vipassana meditation. Also, in other words, mahamudra meditation

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.280
 and zukti meditations.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:46.680
 This is, it is fresh, it is natural, it is without any effort. You are relaxing in that natural

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.280
 status.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:56.280
 What is this? Also, we are not wondering our mind in every direction. You are now already settled.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.280
 Settle. During this time, during this time, what is it? Relaxing in the natural.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.280
 Relaxing in the natural, any semi-opened eye. F is not bothering you with eye.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:17.280
 If it is not eye-opening, it is not bothering, semi-opened eye. Looking toward tip of nose.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.790
 Not exactly tip of nose, but toward tip of nose. Or just above, sometimes teaching said, like this

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.280
 height.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:35.280
 This height, like this, status, looking toward tip, to the direct, to the space.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:44.280
 And if you are semi-open, or eyes open, that status, and trying to not blink the eye.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:52.330
 Not blink the eye, and not move the eyeballs. Why? Again, in the teaching said, it is very

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.280
 important to not move the eyes.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:06.170
 In the teaching said, mind is very much dependent with wind. Mind is very much dependent or very

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.280
 much connected.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.280
 I use the word connected. Mind is very much connected with wind.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.280
 Wind is very much connected with the channels, or the nerve systems.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 And the nerve systems are very much connected with the eye.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:33.280
 And we have five senses, but among all the senses, eye is one of the very active, powerful senses.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:46.310
 So if I go that indicate, if I start moving, it will triple the tingling, triggers, the channels,

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.280
 the nerve systems.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.280
 That channels trigger, and that will trigger the wind more.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.280
 If wind is more triggering, that will trigger the mind, mind.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:06.280
 And when mind triggers more, and then mind is moving, then become a little bit kind of restless.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:18.520
 Those reasons said in these teachings, not trying to not move the eyes blinking, or moving the eyeb

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.280
alls.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.690
 If you close the eye, and then it is different, then we don't have to concern, and just relax the

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.280
 mind in a natural state.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:40.280
 The way you are going to relax it is, now it is natural, fresh, and without effort.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.280
 And here, what is in this teaching said? This is the three techniques.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:54.220
 You are not going to follow any external conduction or circumstance, relaxing in that freshness

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.280
 state.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:07.280
 And also, sorry, I am sorry, stay in the freshness state, maybe I could use freshness states.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280
 Stay in the freshness states.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:19.150
 And also, when you stay in the freshness states, not too much tight, not too much forceful, or not

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.280
 too much loose.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.280
 That means, not too much tight of our three doors.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:35.280
 What are three doors in the teaching said? Three doors of the body, speech, and the mind.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 So not too much tight of the body.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 And what is speech in this case? We are not talking, but speech is wind.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.280
 Not too much energy, or wind trying to tight, or controlling.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.280
 That means also even controlling the breathing, breathing, breathing.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:03.280
 And then, not too much also forceful mind, forceful, very relaxed.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.280
 So this is what is called relax.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:21.280
 And then be in that natural rhythm, natural rhythm, natural rhythm without losing the awareness,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.280
 without losing the awareness.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:37.280
 This is, as I said, the beginning of the Mahamudra meditation and Dzogchen meditation.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.280
 This is how we start the meditations.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.280
 This, in other words, we must use a very simple rule.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:54.280
 These three are no distractions, no effort, no constructions, or trying to make something.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.280
 These three things.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.280
 When you relax in that natural state, when you relax in that state,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:11.370
 this has also, according here, in the teaching, said, it also completed all three doors of

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.280
 liberation.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.430
 According Mahayana teaching, or generally what I teach in Mahayana, and as well as Vaidyana

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.280
 teaching too,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 three doors of liberation are known as cause, resolve, and it is identity.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.280
 If I put, you can't remember, it's simple.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:41.280
 Cause is simple, we tell, cause is emptiness, resolve is emptiness, and identity is emptiness.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:50.280
 Or also use the terminology in the teaching, cause is beyond the character stress,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:15:00.280
 and resolve is beyond the expectations, and nature is empty.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 But it all means, generally different warning, but simply, if you can understand, I said it.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:14.280
 Cause is empty, resolve is empty, and nature is empty.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280
 Nature, what means?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.280
 Nature of the cause, nature of the resolve is empty.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.280
 All that is emptiness.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.280
 And we relax in that natural status, natural status,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:34.280
 which means we are in the prison status, prison, right, in the prison status.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:42.750
 When we are relaxing the prison status, we are not lingering our code in the past memories, past

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.280
 constructions.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.280
 That is here.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:54.280
 Imagine, it is preformed, the door of liberation preformed the cause.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:02.280
 Usually, in our conceptual level, in our mind level, the kind of past is cause.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.280
 That's what this result, and the future, that is what the present is here.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.280
 Future will be a result of this present.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.280
 That's our kind of idea, even there is nothing really that comes.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280
 But that's the way our mind thinks, thinks.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.280
 So therefore, here, when we relax in that natural state of the present,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.280
 there is no lingering thought, no kind of brain thought of the past, all these and that things.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:37.280
 Things, that is the emptiness of the cause, cause.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.280
 Cause, the emptiness, all the cause, emptiness of the beyond characteristics.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.280
 When you are sitting in a reside in the prison status, there is no present, actually.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.280
 There is nothing that we grab to hold the present.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.280
 The present itself is just a name, in a way.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.280
 There is nothing really to hold that we grab.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.280
 It's just this fresh state of the present.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:10.280
 That is, the present is the emptiness, the role of the present of the emptiness.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.280
 When there are no expectations and broken things for the future,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:26.280
 that is, the result is preformed or the emptiness of the expectations, expectations.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:36.280
 So therefore, abiding in this natural status, status is all completed, three dolls of liberation,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280
 say that.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 That, actually, what that, again, what are we going to bring from this?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.280
 This means everything is captured.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:50.280
 Past is captured, future is captured, present is captured,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.030
 where, in the great openness of the emptiness of the pure from the beginning, that will, that we

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.280
 are talking,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:08.280
 all that free from the corporate cities and free from any graspings, cleanings,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.280
 that prison status is gone.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.280
 We are decided, relaxing in that natural status.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:24.280
 That, when we are relaxing in that natural status, our mind is become calm and peaceful.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.280
 We are relaxing.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.280
 There is no more worries.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.280
 There is no more anxieties.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.280
 There is no more fears.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.280
 There is no more expectations.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:43.280
 All those games of the thoughts are completely subsided,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:51.280
 liberated within its own natural status.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.280
 That is, then, performed meditation.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:04.280
 In this case, named as performed special samadha meditations, special samadha meditations.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:12.280
 This itself, as I said, itself is mahamadhara and zoki, zoki teachings, zoki practice.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.280
 This is what it is.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.280
 It is.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.280
 Now, so, with this understanding, with this understanding, again, here,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.280
 great masters continue activating or re-glorifying this.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.280
 And, again, he said, really, how to do, how to maintain this, or with all those different names,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.280
 the causes, the emptiness, the results, the emptiness, the nature is the emptiness.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.280
 All this, what the great teacher, Buddha, Dr. Mani, told,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.280
 which means everything is in that natural status.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.280
 How to maintain this?

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.280
 Stay with this nature of the mind.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.280
 Relax in that status, without any trying to do anything.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.280
 When we do that, everything is completely within that.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.280
 Every, all the teachings, all those idealizations,

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.280
 everything is completed within that status.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.280
 Relaxing mind in that natural state, everything is completed.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.280
 As hundreds of rivals of the different vailis can be put under one bridge,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 under one bridge, hundreds of rivals, or hundreds of rivals of different vailis.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.280
 Vailis can be put under one bridge.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 That is relaxing our mind in that natural status.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.280
 How to relax that natural status?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:47.280
 Not changing, not constructing, not making effort, and relaxing.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:57.280
 And without losing that present, present, or without losing that awareness, awareness, that.
