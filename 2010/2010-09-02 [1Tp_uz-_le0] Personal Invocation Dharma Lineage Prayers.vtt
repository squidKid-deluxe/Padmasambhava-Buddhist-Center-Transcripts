00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 I think all of the Buddhists, by the way, the Buddhists, they do this. Before they do the teaching,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.000
 they always do a lot of personal invocation prayers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.160
 That actually also happens, for example, when you read the history of Buddhism after Buddhism, a

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.000
 marker in Nirvana,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 and that next summer, first time they have a conference, or a conference, right?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.950
 A house council, the first council that happened there, and five hundred rahatas collected five

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.000
 hundred rahatas,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.490
 the first row, and folded in four times, and piled up, and above that, Anand said in thinking of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.000
 the Buddhists,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 the Buddhists, the gracious kindness, and the thinking of the woman, and then he gathered all the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.000
 separate teachings.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 Then, similarly, next, again, that second Upadhi state, or in the biblical New York, sit on that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 same throne,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 and then, again, thinking of the Buddha as gracious, and kindness, and wisdom, and conversation,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 and then he gathered all the Vinaya teachings.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 And then, with that finished, then, who is the first Baptist, or the first religion, the Haka Shaka

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.000
, sat on that throne,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 and did that prayer, again thinking of the Buddha, and did this. So, this is the continual line of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.000
 all those teachings.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 All the teachers, when intubated Buddhism left, when they gave the teaching, they joined.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.370
 All the prayers, thinking of the gracious kindness, and the wisdom of those, all the great masters

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.000
 passed,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 and then, particularly, those who were at home, they received the teachings, and nourished,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 and grew up both spiritually, whatever they do, whatever they know, those comes from the teachers,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 remembering of the teachers,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 and so, that's what they do previously, that's what the Kṛṣṇa body does, and then I pray,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.550
 and then end of those prayers, Protestant, some more personal kind of organics, prayers, prayers,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.000
 and then,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.550
 in the teachings, say, generally, always, this is the teaching, say, the Buddha teaching is not

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.000
 just kind of like perfect teachings,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.890
 teachings on the nature of every living, it is a teaching on the compassion, teaching on the wisdom

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.000
,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 teaching on the economic or the equality, and balance, therefore, there is nothing to really hide,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.640
 there is nothing in the spirit, or nothing in the Lord, we all share the same thing, and we like to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 explore in the nature.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So, therefore, in the Buddha's teachings, the Buddha himself said that, when you give the teaching,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.780
 or whoever gives the teaching, you should also remind everyone to come and join, who would like to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.000
 receive the teaching.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.570
 So, this is Paul's prayer, he said that, if the pray toward the universal fold, wherever the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.000
 disciple of the Buddha,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 and whoever would like to receive the teaching, or like to kind of remind and inspire each of you,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.730
 come here to be, and be joined with us, whoever would like to come, and there is prayer, so that I

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.000
 do that prayer,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 and then, again, this is not just art, that's just, everybody, and then, in the teachings, again,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 teaching is not necessarily one language, so there is, again, prayer.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.800
 He said, now I do the teachings in the language of gods, Nagas, Asuras, Gandharvas, and all the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.000
 other languages,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 every language, so please come, whoever like to reconnect with the teaching, as teaching.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 So, those, I do pray, praise, and those are the, those are what I pray.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.200
 And then I will tell some stories, stories, again, even though he does, he's getting mad, but I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.000
 will tell stories.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 When I was young, and I was, in Tibet, my father is, I always go with father to do ceremony,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.920
 Ken would already went to the, to the Gautamana stage, so I was always go with father to do the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.000
 ceremony in Tibet, Tibet.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.420
 So then, there is a self in Gautamana stage, there is true Nadiya, I mean, there's quite a few Nadi

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.000
ya ceremony,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 but very big one, it's called Tukhichamu, Nondesamu ceremony.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's a practice on Awalokrishyota.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 This, it is discovered by the Satsang Mumbai. It's a big teaching, great competition practice,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 and that will dominate about Satsang and Ravan. That's the title of this teaching.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So, this is a non-stop teaching for 24 hours and 7 days a week. It is a jukti.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And then, of course, then they will post in the night, during the day, not every, everyone yawned.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.420
 By the nighttime, then perhaps they divide it. So this, not everybody have to go, but some, they

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.000
 divide it,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 and then they will, they pick up the, whoever had the first rotation, they pick up the intubate,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 they pick up the grass, sometimes they pull the grass, and sometimes they roll the paper,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and then that guru, each guru, divide it, and then go and yawn.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 So, those who are young ones, minetans, they yawn, but they don't really, kind of, do it practice

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 at nighttime,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 there's not minet, not that, that cheetah, that monitors, also not really, always there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 So, there's a lot, kind of, like, naughty things. Like, Kiribati has a lot of stories.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Kiribati himself, he is a little bit, I think, more stronger. And I'm not like that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I was being, like, always say, what's called, like, shy and intimidating, I think.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Anyway, I was, so, I don't have a lot of those, of a guru's story, if I have to tell, really, that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 But anyway, when I was young, young, and I would go and sleep with father,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 and every morning, morning, in the go-to monaster, I think that every monaster, I think, does.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 But first, they blow the conch shell. Conch shell, triple will blow the conch shell.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.370
 Post-conch shell, second conch shell, and then, so they will stop at least, maybe, 10 minutes, 15

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.000
 minutes.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.160
 And that, before someone really, they will blow, because in the summertime, there is a longer, a

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.000
 night is shorter,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 so maybe the ladies, in the 4 o'clock morning, before the dog, they blow that.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And so then, the first time, they blow, and second time, they blow, and then, third time, they blow

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 the trumpet for a long time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 When the trumpet is blowing, father, you say that, dear son, now you must wake up, to me up.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.560
 He always, now he must get, oh, look at this, trumpet is blowing, and third conch shell, when they

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.000
 blow, everybody have to be in the temple.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Everybody have to be in a summer home. So father, you say, dear son, now you must wake up.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.450
 Now you must ready to wake up, because they're blowing the trumpet, and when conch shell, carnal

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.000
 comes, everybody should be in the temple.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.070
 Temple? And so, that's what carnal, like, I remember that always, and I like, I like to sleep, I

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.000
 don't really like to get out.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Father, he said all things, I try to pretend, even I'm more sleeping.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I'm sleeping, trying to, what's called, trying to deliver me, or whatever carnal.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.930
 I just pretend I'm not hearing that sleep. And then he woke up, I wake up, and again, I don't want

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.000
 to get out.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And all those carnal games, I play with father, because I'm not shy, I'm not with him, so.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.300
 So the conch shell, when they blow, they blow, but in the conch shell, and the trumpet, most of

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.000
 them, they blow, they non-stop.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 They have to do the breathing.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 That's the breathing.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Circle, you have to breathe the circles. So I used to go some different, I don't know.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 I'm not going to do it, because you see, you can notice, I'm doing that.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Good ones, really, never see. I mean, this is, of course, I did these things, maybe 35 years ago.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 But those food, you can't see, they are circle-y, circle-y, so.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.400
 And truthfully, in the many-way amyong, I used to learn with straw, straw, and put that in the

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.000
 water, in the glass, glass.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.130
 So then you blow that, and then you will see, your breathing is really hard, bubbling, hard bub

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.000
bling.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 So that's my story.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.040
 When the trumpet and the conch shell, both they will do like this, circle-y, circle-y, because we

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.000
 don't really stop.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 So then it's warm to them.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Okay, so that reminds the story.
