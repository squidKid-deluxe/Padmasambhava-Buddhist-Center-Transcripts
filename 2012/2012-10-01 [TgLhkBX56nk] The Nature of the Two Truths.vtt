00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
 It is two truths. So that is really our words of the ground truth. The truth is so now, again, we

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:27.260
 talked about what is here, the great Master Khentipadir mentioned, that it is as followed as the

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.500
 great Master Dongchenpa's view exactly, so it is explained about in six different ways.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:41.020
 The first is Nature of the Two Truths. The second is the meaning of the Two Truths. And the third

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 is, Prove it is divided, for the best of the deviation of the Two Truths.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:09.280
 And the fifth is characteristics of the Two Truths. And the fifth is the deviation of the Two Truth

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.500
s.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:24.460
 And sixth is the purpose of the Two Truths. So those are six divisions in a way to expanding the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:38.500
 meaning of this Two Truths, or the Two Truths, which is as discovering the grown Mahdi Makar.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.380
 And so Mahdi Makar is the union of this Two Truths. As I said, when we say union, maybe the Buddha

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 made that union, or we are making that union. That is not it.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.010
 This nature is in that state. It is a union. Why are we talking union? Because that is where we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:09.500
 understand in this time. We don't see nature as full, disciplined.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 Our knowledge is restricted, because the habit of it, we see only bits of this. This and we don't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.500
 see everything. Therefore it is as true.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 Otherwise, absolute is absolute. It is the same status. So it is not something that has to make the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:47.580
 division. But this is the way our knowledge, understanding, is penetrating and overwhelming of this

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.500
 nature.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:00.520
 Therefore, then it is true. Then it is true. And so now, the fourth is the nature of this. That is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.500
 what the great Master Shanti Deva said.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:22.140
 Absolute truth is beyond the conception. Relative truth is within the conception. That is what he

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.500
 put.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:36.960
 Something we can understand easily is relative truth. Easy. Something that we can't figure out

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.500
 immediately, that is absolute truth.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.140
 And what is that? Often in the teachings said, in the Paregula or in the Yuma schools of the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.500
 Buddhism, I mean it is not just only that, but that is highlighted.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:06.680
 This is called the appearance in emptiness to truth. So what is appearing to our six senses

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.500
 immediately is relative truth.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:22.120
 And what is the nature of that? What is appearing that we don't see? It is absolute truth and which

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.500
 is the emptiness. That is the name of that.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:40.850
 So appearance and emptiness, that is. So appearance is relative truth and the emptiness of nature

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.500
 is the absolute truth.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:53.580
 That also, Buddha taught. In the Buddha taught, of course, there is a lot of Buddhas, this, this

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.500
 and again in here.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:05.950
 Can you put that here? Quotations to you. And absolute truth is beyond the conception, that is not

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.500
 existing in any places.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 It is not any place existing, not anything. And the relative truth is, the nature of relative truth

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 is within the range of the conception and our mental status.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:45.990
 Therefore, absolute truth is only experienced, recognized by self discrimination, awareness,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.500
 westerns. That is only what we will discover.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:06:01.500
 So that is the nature of this, this truth, nature, more intuitive, nature status.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.880
 So now again, of course this is going to come little more, these things, but however, again, we

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.500
 talk. And this is again one of the other examples, maybe examples.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:23.710
 Relative truth is, what is relative truth? Let us look about our time, in a way. Time, now what is

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.500
 this month? This month is August.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:40.500
 August. And now, this is relative truth, we know. But we think, where is August?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 Now we are thinking, where is August? We start really looking, trying to find out where is August.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.500
 What we will say? What we will say?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:06.870
 There is August. The beautiful August. Beautiful August. Where is this? Where is our beautiful

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.500
 August? It is not really.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:18.570
 We must get that. The day one is August, the second is August, the third is August. Every year we

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.500
 will say, it is not, not, not.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:30.670
 So, that is just a brief and roughly examples of that. If we don't ever get analyzed, if we don't

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:38.500
 think August is here, August came, August is still here, and August will leave sometime soon.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:49.500
 It is just beautiful. It is nice, nice. But if we investigate, analyze, if we put the analyzations,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500
 then August is disappeared.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 Couldn't take our pressure of the analyzations. Couldn't take that pressure of the reason. Reason.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:13.500
 That is what known as the relative truth and absolute truth.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:23.120
 This is also that nature that we don't find. It is not something separated from the August. But yet

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:33.500
, it is not there as we think or we name. It is not there.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:41.150
 This is the same thing to every this phenomenal existence. If you can analyze, if it is a get,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:48.500
 maybe you will find, find finally hexabonds. Right? Hexabonds.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:59.860
 If you analyze hexabonds, you will find. But if you go more, four steps, more, two more steps, don

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.500
't. I don't think you can find anything. What is left is only mind.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:15.580
 That is the only left. Nothing is going. That is how it is everything. If you analyze MSG, there is

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.500
 nothing that can take the pressure.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:26.890
 For that reason, in the great masters, these great masters often say, relative truth, it cannot

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.500
 take the pressure of the analyzations. Can't take analyzations.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:40.700
 It is there. There, if you don't get MSG, analyze. Those, I will talk a little more about that. For

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.500
 that reason, the great master Chanda Rakta said.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:55.750
 If you don't look at MSG, it is fine. It is so beautiful. It looks nice. But analyze. MSG, if you

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:04.500
 put that in laboratory, it is like banana trees.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:17.460
 That is why everything is known as mirage. That is why it is known as everything is dream. That is

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.500
 what relative truth is all.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:30.500
 For that reason, what I said, poem is emptiness. Emptiness of poem. There is no difference.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:48.240
 But I pointed right in Heart Sutter that true truth, so plain, so precisely, poem is emptiness. Em

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.500
ptiness of poem. That is what the nature is. This is what the nature is.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 This is what the nature of truth is.
