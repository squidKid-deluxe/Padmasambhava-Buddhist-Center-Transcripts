00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 Our accorded division of the Yandere Ngondro, the practicing, now the extra ordinary Gondro

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.500
 practices.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 Those extra ordinary Gondro practices, the first is rafuq, second is bodhijata,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 and third is accorded Hizam Dunirumu, the short Gondro, third is mandala offering,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 the long Gondro, then third is the very subtle practices, and the fourth is mandala offering,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and the fifth is guru yoga practices. And along with that, then the sixth is bodhistations.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 So altogether, in a way, six points. Now the fourth is rafuq, and rafuq is, of course,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 this is the general, this rafuq has no reference to any Buddhism.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 When you practice the Buddhism, of course, you take the rafuq, no reference.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.940
 All the Buddhism, there's really no reference. And therefore, it's called foundation of the Buddha

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.000
 teachings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 It's very foundation. With all the rafuq, also there is no other practice follows.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Vedayana or Vedayaki practices, everything practices are really best rooted on the rafuq.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Rafuq is so, so special. And even the teaching says that keep the rafuq essence of your practice,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 or more of the practices. So that is really the meaning of rafuq or the jambuq.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And now, to do these rafuq practices, according to lineage instruction, of course, you follow

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 and feel the strong presence of the object rafuq, rafuq.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Object rafuq is the identity of what they are.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Object rafuq is A, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Or in Vedayana teaching, known as Guru, Deva, and Dakini. Those are the three object rafuq.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 But when you visualize that, according to instruction, what do you visualize?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 In the teaching, right in front of your space, the letter I, there is a beautiful tree.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Tree of big, large tree blooming, and it has four strings.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Four strings. And then, so in the middle of that,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 there is, in the middle of this rock, there is Gurb and Masambhava,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 who is embodiment of all of the rafus, embodiment of all of the rafus.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Everything comes through it as form of the Gurb and Masambhava, and there.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And above the Gurb and Masambhava, in the cloud, in the rainbow light, all the lineage masters.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Those are known as, like, six lineages. So, yeah, six lineages, mind to mind,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.370
 lamas of the mind to mind, task-making lineage, symbolic task-making lineage, order task-making

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.000
 lineage.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And Dakini handled task-making lineage, and as well as, kind of, theta, mona,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 and then aspiration and empowerment lineages.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And then, the cover, and then, atrocity and predicted linear masters.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Those are the three lineages from the Dharma teachings.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 That all those masters are in the rainbow, and also in the rainbow bodies,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 looking to ask with eye of love and compassion, vashta, and Gurb and Masambhava for all that.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 By calling his only union with lineage on the right side of there, on the Gurb and Masambhava,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 there is the bhirva, again, lord of the theatres, and all the sun and moon,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 and above that, Buddha Shakyamuni, and with all the one called the Buddhas.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.820
 And the right side of the Gurb and Masambhava, left side, sorry, left side of the Gurb and Masambh

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.000
ava,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 there is then all the great bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas, as well as all arhathas.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Arhathas, such as medjishiri, vedipani, avallokrihiram, all the chariputra, mongarputra,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 all those things are right there.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And then, on the front side, there is then all the inner deities, such as vedikalayas,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 and then hyangirvas, medjishiri, yamitakas, all those head hirukas,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 peace, vorath, greed is all that right there.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And the back side of the Gurb and Masambhava, that means five petres, sorry, I said.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Five petres of lord was a big one, center is the Gurb and Masambhava.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Above that is all the lineage dhammas, veditāra, and the right side is the Buddha,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 and all the Buddha's enlightenment, all the Buddha's and left side is all the Sangh bodhisattvas,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and Arhathas, and all the Sangha members.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And the front is all the Yadam deities, and Guru, Devan, Dakinis, all that in front of them.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And the back side is that all the dhammas, all the teachings,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 and in the form of the all shimmering light of the books and the teachings,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 like one, those grandeur, dangerous, all the Buddha's teachings, all those teachings,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 they are subtle, reciting, sounding, emanating light.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And then in front of that you put stone with full devotion and stone presence,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 and then join this rafuddhi phrase as in the teachings.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 "Oya, it's all here, really." "Oya, really it's all here, that's it."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'll look at this way, if I look here, I'll look at it."

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.150
 So, look at this, this is the breathable soul, that's his hondun, which is like according to his

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.000
 lineage.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And this is the window, and that. And visualize that strongly and beautifully.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Everything is so light in the place, it's simply energy.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And so many blessed lights are coming to you, and to all the beings of the six of them,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 completely purified, everyone's obstacles, obscurations, difficulty, challenges,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 bring everything as a perfectly enlightened, really soul stone, and feel so happy and joy.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Then from now on, until I reach the enlightenment, I check rafuddhi.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 The Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru Deva, Rakhine, all of them are somewhat inseparable.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Also, in many times in the teachings they said, in the three, they said, "Kundi, Narvala."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 One of the rafuddhi, one object of rafuddhi contains all the rafuddhi,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 it's like which perfectly dual?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Dual, so that said, then you don't have to think so many of all those things.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 If it's difficult, that's the thing, Gaurabhar Masambha is everything.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And Gaurabhar Masambha is inseparable with his hondun, your rafuddhi, or your rafuddhi teacher.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Whatever that, it's inseparable, that's it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And then just really stone presence, and then jahin, the rafuddhi phrase.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And many times according to his Holisticism, he's teaching and said,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 "Then also you join the rafuddhi in the phrase, and at the same time you do the post-stationary."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.410
 So that means you memorize the rafuddhi phrase, such as short hundun, and rafuddhi is just two

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.000
 lines,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 and join that, reflect the meaning on that, and then join the post-stationary.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And post-stationary is like, there's short post-stationary and long post-stationary.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.170
 And short post-stationary, long post-stationary, that if you can, do the pull, that means that you

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.000
 all know that.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 So that means, pull this long post-stationary, well-touch pipe point of your body on the ground.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 That's it. So that means what?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.990
 When you do the long post-stationary, and it touches your forehead on the ground, of course, and

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.000
 three palms, three,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 and then your two knees will touch on the ground, so pull point.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.200
 Yeah, that is a short post-stationary, and the long post-stationary, you will touch it to your

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.000
 belly, belly on the ground.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So, I think, six points, I think.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But always in the teaching, it's five points. So that is short post-stationary.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Long post-stationary, if you can do, that's also really good.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 It's also a very good exercise in the external level.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.900
 But also according to teaching, that is also, of course, really great purification of the body of

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.000
 secretions.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 It's a great purification of body of secretions.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.740
 And when you do the post-stationary, you do rafu, you pray, you just say, also, again, this mahay

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.000
ana,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 the post-stationary, the rafu, you're taking rafu, your mahayana.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So you can think, you're not just yourself alone.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.100
 You feel you are multiplying so many numbers, and all the beings of six realms are joined together

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.000
 with you.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 In a way, you are leading them to do the post-stationary.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Everyone doing the same post-stationary, and everyone counting the same prayers

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and doing the same findings, the same motivations.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Really feel that even in the teaching, you say that your parents,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 you're someone that they don't like or they don't like us, but this time, include them.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And they're all targeted. We're all enjoying and purifying our obscurations.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Accumulate them here. Feel with that and do the post-stationary.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 As much as you can. So that is really about rafu juice.
