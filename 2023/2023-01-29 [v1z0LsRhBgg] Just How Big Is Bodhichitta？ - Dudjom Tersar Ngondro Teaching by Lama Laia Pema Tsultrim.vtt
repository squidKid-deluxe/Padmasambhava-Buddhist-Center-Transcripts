00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to come, be together, near and far.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.880
 It's very special, very precious, so rejoicing in that. And as usual, just the heart of every

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:33.040
 teaching, the root, the foundation of every experience we have, our motivation. So again,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.960
 just as always, part of our practice, in the beginning, just really connecting with our

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.360
 motivations and these three vast, beautiful, powerful motivations that entail our complete

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.440
 practice. And that's why we begin with that. So our joy, our appreciation for this precious

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.840
 moment we have, and this precious life, all the things we're free of, all the situations

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.480
 we have, all the good outer and inner conditions, especially related to exploring and bringing

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:27.760
 out our own innate goodness and sanity and realness. And then our great devotion and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:37.200
 purity vision of the sacred nature of this moment, this experience, reflecting on the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 three vatras, all form and appearances as the enlightened display, all sound and movement,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:08.160
 enlightened speech of mantra, all space and awareness and thought, the vast expanse of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.760
 pure mind. And then in all this great fortune, we've had this opportunity to come together

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.720
 and practice. And as usual, we're going to continue with a little bit of reflecting.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.400
 We're all practicing together and studying and practicing. So I wanted to get back, you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 know, we've really encouraging a little bit of discourse. It'd be nice if we were all

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:47.280
 in the same room, but we're not. So we do have communication. So do have a couple questions

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 that are just good questions. And this is both particularly within our bodhicitta practice.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:07.240
 So of course, within our Nundro practice, bodhicitta is so essential. It's this, you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.960
 know, the second main frame that we spend time meditating with. And like Dojo Mepeshe,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:25.600
 it's the root of the whole path, arousing our bodhicitta intention. The whole path is

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.400
 all within bodhicitta. So maybe I'll ask, I'll just kind of put forth the questions that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 are here and then kind of come back and reflect to that. But again, just keeping in mind that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.040
 bodhicitta, again, it's not its own little separate section, just like none of the sections

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:59.520
 of our Nundro practice are solely just their, their aspects and atmospheres and qualities

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:09.160
 that pervade every aspect of all the sections of Nundro, which means all the practices will

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.920
 ever do, whose aim is what? To recognize things as they are, to remove our obscurations and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:28.520
 their causes and bring out innate wisdom, compassion, love, kindness, uncontrived, genuine

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:43.240
 love, wisdom, compassion, beauty, which is bodhicitta. So it's the root, which means it's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.640
 also the sprouts, the branches, the leaves and the fruits, and not just one fruit, but

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.360
 millions and billions of fruits. There's so many praises to the qualities of bodhicitta,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.720
 because again, it is our, ultimately our innate nature, our own Buddha nature is bodhicitta

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.720
 realized. So I'm going to get to the question here. So this is particularly, this is from

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:21.400
 Julie wrote, I think maybe from one of the last sessions and during the bodhicitta session,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.760
 of course, the prayer that we're saying is our, our bodhisattva vow, kind of renewing

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.400
 in every section, restoring our bodhicitta motivation and inspiration. And so that is

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.880
 right from now until samsara becomes empty, I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:56.880
 of all sentient parent beings. And so then Julie was asking, the phrase until samsara

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.040
 becomes empty, doesn't really mean empty, like a movie theater after the show is over,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.120
 does it? Or is it more like we sometimes see the view defined, the perfect equality of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:18.920
 samsara and nirvana? So that's the first question around the first line. And then the second

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:28.520
 line, I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings is

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.760
 also very puzzling for me. Although I had probably heard about things being insubstantial

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:41.560
 many times I only understood this in connection to sentient beings. When I read Dojumlinpa's

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.120
 account of his dream in which Longchenpa convinced him that sentient beings with their own

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.800
 individual

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.160
 mind streams did not exist. A disturbing and almost terrifying idea. So I don't really

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.000
 know how to understand or even attempt to accomplish this thing. And also isn't there

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.520
 an eye to accomplish another sticking point? So yeah, I think the point is, is that's exactly

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:25.200
 where we're stuck. With I, right, the source of all suffering, the first noble truth and

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:37.480
 second noble truth is as long as we have our basic ignorance and ego clinging and engage

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:47.440
 with negative emotions instantly that brings up the whole fruit of our samsara experience.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:56.680
 So definitely working with investigating our concept of "I" is so vital, so important,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:12.200
 so really important. And that is the path within our practice. I think we practice the

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:20.600
 unity of the three yanas, the Theravadin, the foundational Buddhism, Mahayana, and an extension

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:34.440
 of that, the Vajrayana. And it seems worth just kind of remembering too, sometimes we

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:43.840
 hear Mahayana, and of course that's I think we've all heard it. Mahayana is in relation

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.640
 to foundational Buddhism or Hinayana, which is sometimes called the lesser vehicle. But

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.800
 that's in no way like a diminutive statement. I think sometimes it's also maybe like the

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:06.160
 smaller, more narrow view, the narrow viewed vehicle, you know, a smaller, but it's just

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:15.840
 like all the teachings of the Buddha. Until we ourselves have more realization and stability

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.160
 and knowledge, we're not going to be really of much help to anybody, not ourselves, not

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:34.360
 anyone. So within the Hinayana, right, the focus there is self-liberation, which is very

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:43.920
 practical again for that reason. Unless we ourselves are going to work on ourselves,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.840
 we're the only ones who can free ourselves. And so we take that responsibility for our

00:09:50.840 --> 00:10:00.080
 own freedom. And then of course, on then other levels, kind of the fruition, we're also exploring

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:11.120
 the emptiness of I, of self. And that fruition is like the state of like in our heart, where

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.160
 we're free of, you know, our negative emotions and creating more negative emotions. We've

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:27.080
 directly perceiving the illusory nature of this conglomeration of interdependence that

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:38.720
 we call me or I. And then, but it doesn't stop there, we continue and that's where Mahayana

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:47.200
 comes in, where our focus isn't just taking responsibility for our own liberation, but

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:59.280
 with a heart of love and compassion and caring and wisdom of seeing how open the situation

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:08.200
 is, we take the responsibility to free all beings from suffering and its causes, to give

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:16.400
 them the means so the focus is wider. And we're also taking everything onto the path,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:25.200
 we're not excluding anything from the path of purifying and awakening. And then the fruit

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:40.800
 is Buddhahood through all the paths and the bhoomis. So from now, and again, until attaining

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.480
 the heart, until samsara becomes empty, I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:57.640
 of all sentient parent beings. So it is, is so rich, these lines of, and I think one really

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:06.680
 helpful way, at least to relate to everything, is if we remember the two truths, there's

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:16.400
 relative truth, there's absolute truth. There's the, what's the word remember, Shay used it

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:25.200
 a lot during the teachings, as far as in the Buddhist teachings, there's kind of preliminary,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.960
 there's definitive meaning, provisional, there's provisional meanings, and then there's absolute

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:46.800
 meanings. And as we've all heard many times with our bodhicitta practice, we're engaging in

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:46.960
 awakening

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:54.400
 our absolute bodhicitta realization, again, for the benefit of all beings. And we do that through

00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:01.680
 the skillful means of accumulating merit and purify up uprooting our ego clinging through

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:10.240
 our, as per our relative bodhicitta, which is, you know, really connecting again and again with

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:17.120
 the four boundless and actualizing our, our wish for enlightenment, for the benefit of all beings

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.760
 through the six paramita practices, right? But then just looking at these lines until samsara

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:35.600
 becomes empty, from now until samsara becomes empty. We have, we can have this big view of,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:47.040
 we're in the meditation, we're here before Gurumpushe and all the, all seeing, all knowing,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.680
 all loving wisdom of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas are right with us taking witness of us

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:04.000
 and our inspiration and our aspiration and our joy and our commitment and our humbleness

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.200
 of like caring for this supreme wish.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:20.560
 And we have, you know, the five paths,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.120
 which is the way the Buddha mapped out the path to enlightenment.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.880
 When we first meet the teachings, the accumulation path, the path, and then we,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.120
 we connect with our meditation and our practice and study. And then we progress into the joining,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.510
 the bridge of actually beginning to have realization of what's at the, what the Buddha is pointing

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:49.760
 us

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:57.120
 towards. And then the path of seeing where we actually see directly and unmistakably the open,

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:05.680
 empty nature of ourself and all phenomena. And then the path of meditation is the continued

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.640
 purification through then what's called the ten boomies of the bodhisattvas

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:20.080
 until the path of no more learning of our Buddhahood. And so obviously we don't have time

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.640
 to go through those, but it's really helpful to look at the descriptions of the five paths

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.000
 and the ten boomies, at least their names and a little bit of their qualities. And I know in

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.480
 Rinpoche's book, Door to Inconceivable Wisdom and Compassion, there's a chapter, I think the last

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:45.680
 chapter is on the five paths and also Rinpoche's very briefly go over the ten boomies. And is it

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:51.200
 also in a more recent book too, going over the five paths and ten boomies?

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.840
 It must be, I think in one of the newer, the books of like walking in the footsteps.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:07.680
 I think, but anyway, it's definitely here. And it's, I'm sure lots of other places do.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:15.920
 But that's a big view. But the important part is from now, no matter where we're at,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:25.920
 no matter what we've done, good or bad, helpful or not, no matter what our degree of realization,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:36.080
 we have the precious bodhicitta. From beginningless time, we and all sentient beings have been

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:44.160
 wandering, all wanting happiness, but doing all the things that lead us further away from it

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.640
 due to our ignorance, and being caught up in our hopes and fears,

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:58.640
 and just creating more and more obscurations. Like it said, from now until attaining enlightenment,

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:07.840
 until samsara becomes empty. So yes, we need to recognize empty. So I think there's a metaphor

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:14.880
 here of yes, on one level, it is like a metaphor of the opera house being empty.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:24.880
 All the players have gone home, all the audience has dispersed, or, you know,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:32.560
 but definitely the deeper meaning is until samsara becomes empty. So

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:41.360
 we need to accumulate, you know, achieve the two benefits, we need to benefit before we can

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:48.720
 benefit anyone benefit ourselves through having that wisdom of seeing the emptiness of ourselves

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.280
 and others, and all these skillful means practices we have that help us get there through

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.880
 intellectual

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.440
 analysis, and heart practice, and all these skillful means practices we have also with our

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:11.600
 rajrayana practices. And then with that, naturally comes our, not only our compassion and our love

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:21.920
 being more open and vast, but actually more informed, and more beneficial. And through

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:31.360
 that compassion and love, we are helping others to also recognize the inseparability of samsara

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:39.440
 nirvana to recognize, which is what the border is our own mind, that vast openness.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:49.840
 There's also, you know, that very famous story of Chenrezig, of Thousand Arm Chenrezig,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.560
 how like as a bodhisattva, Chenrezig did many beneficial activities that

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:02.000
 emptied, emptied samsara, but then before you knew it,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:11.120
 it's full again of sentient beings and just that heart wrenching quality. And then I said that

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:20.080
 through that, you know, he really broke up. But obviously, he continued. So the point,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:28.480
 I guess the main point I'm getting at is, like it said in the sutras, as we could sit,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.200
 there's no way we could measure space.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:47.520
 It's infinite. It's without limit. It's inconceivably vast openness is space. And within

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.560
 space, as far as there's space, the Buddha said, the omniscient ones, the knowing ones,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:01.200
 there are sentient beings. And sentient beings are there. The only difference between sentient

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:09.520
 being and fully enlightened Buddha is the recognition and realization of their innate nature

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.760
 in different degrees.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 And we are, and, you know, of course, may we all realize it. And truly,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.040
 that's why it's so important we practice and meditate, shamatha meditation,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:42.240
 develop our concentration, develop our insight and our intellectual capacity to investigate

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.640
 our reality and settle and practice.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:58.960
 Because then we aren't tricked by the display, because I think that's the important point here,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:05.120
 right, is, and it's very important in the bodhisattva motivation, there is no end line.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:15.360
 The only end is, you know, our own samsara, and then as each being recognizes their true

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:24.400
 nature and purifies, then their samsara ceases. But it's endless, it's vast, and it's all open

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.800
 and empty of being anything solid or permanent or independent.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.760
 So it's big, vast view. We've all heard again and again, but really bringing it to heart

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.680
 into our practice from where we are is so important.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:53.600
 So yeah, we're just as real as the Buddhas, and we shouldn't confuse,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:22:06.080
 I don't know in the second question here, we're all dream beings, we're all illusory beings.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.720
 And when we're less than, and others are more important than ourselves,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.880
 and we see how open the situation is, then we're good. But we shouldn't, I mean,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:29.040
 not to confuse the relative truth that as long as we don't recognize the nature, we all have our

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.920
 samsara experiences. And we're not kind of establishing a nihilist view that nothing

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:43.360
 matters, or I don't exist, so why do anything, or people's pain isn't real, so what, you know,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:50.400
 I think we all know we're saying that, but for on the relative level, we experience things.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.770
 On the ultimate level, we don't have any difference. So I think the other thing I wanted to get at

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.200
 was

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:06.080
 what are some really points, you know, we've talked again about how important our motivation is,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:15.440
 that is arousing the way bodhicitta is defined is, may I attain enlightenment in order to benefit

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:23.360
 all sentient parent beings. And in the Mahayana teachings are also that motivation and that

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 is so prime and so vital, because that is how the nature acts in an uncontrived way.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:38.640
 And also with that are the great the teachings on the nature the Buddha gave of great emptiness.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.280
 So definitely, that's another great book to read, if you haven't is Kenshin Palden,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.920
 Rinpoche and Kenpo Seong Rinpoche's book on the heart sutra, which so clearly goes through this

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:59.520
 profound teaching on great emptiness, but also in a way also shows us, you know, the first turning,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.280
 second turning, and then base for the third turning of the Buddhist teachings.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:17.040
 So then, here we are, from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment, we take refuge in the

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.920
 three jewels, whose soul embodiment is the precious Lama, our precious teacher. And before

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:31.680
 our precious teachers and all the noble ones, you know, we make the commitment until samsara is

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:39.760
 empty, until all beings recognize the vast openness. Until I, I'm going to keep going,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 unfolding awakening in order to truly be a benefit to all beings to recognize their innate freedom.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:25:01.520
 And I'll work for the benefit of all sentient parent beings. And what is that benefit? It

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:12.000
 is awakening, awakening bodhicitta, acting bodhicitta. So then within our, our, our tradition,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.480
 and our lineage, which of course, it all comes through Buddha Shakyamuni, the great kindness

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.120
 teacher in this fortunate age, who we're all connected to, who was a great bodhisattva,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:34.880
 and fully enlightened Buddha, now living. And then there's also these other great bodhisattvas,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:43.920
 still existing. So our lineage of taking the bodhisattva vows in this world, in our living lineage,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.880
 is coming from, of course, Buddha Shakyamuni. And then there's called what's the profound

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:57.280
 bodhisattva lineage, and profound.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:11.280
 That's coming from bodhisattva Manjushri. And from Manjushri came to Nagarjuna. And Nagarjuna

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.240
 came down to Shantarakshita. And then of course, Shantarakshita came to Tibet and was

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.840
 held and brought down into Tibet. And then also the other profound lineage is coming into this

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:31.280
 world again, Buddha Shakyamuni. And then from the great bodhisattva Maitreya to Asanga in India.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:38.400
 And then one of Asanga students in the bodhicitta trainings and teachings was Atisha. And then

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:47.040
 Atisha came to Tibet. So Shantarakshita, Atisha to Tibet, coming down that rich tradition to Longch

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.360
ampa.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.400
 And then Longchampa gave those teachings to the great teacher Mindling Turchin,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.520
 the great Mindling Turchin of Mindrilling monastery, which was such a renowned,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.360
 powerful practice lineage and study practice going there.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.720
 Doloch and Dharmashri came down eventually to again, His Holiness, Dudram and Pashay.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.800
 And then to our precious Kenchampald and Sharab and Pashay, and Kenpo Samondang and Pashay.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:22.080
 So in any case, that's there. And then when we take our bodhisattva vow, we're doing that in

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:30.080
 our nundra in this section, every time renewing it. But then I just thought I'll stop talking soon,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:36.400
 but just some basic points that are helpful for remembering with our bodhisattva training.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.400
 Because again, our bodhi, all our nundra practice and our bodhi,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:49.760
 our nundra practice and our bodhicitta practice, of course, we're touching home base.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.560
 We're doing the meditation on our cushion. But the point is to bring out that quality,

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.200
 those atmosphere, that view, and let our conduct follow with that, like wherever we go,

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.840
 on the cushion, off the cushion, formal practice, informal meditation, post meditation.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:19.120
 And so the conduct of the bodhisattvas is, of course, always based on the four boundless,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.800
 connecting with the aspirational relative bodhicitta of the four boundless.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.960
 And then based on that, we have what's called the three moralities

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:41.200
 of the bodhisattvas that we can check in with, just as really simple guideposts.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.200
 And that's like the morality of avoiding negative

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:56.080
 actions and engaging in positive actions, before negativities and engaging with them.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.240
 And then there's the morality that go that gathers all

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:12.160
 all good things. And then there's the morality that is actually

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:23.360
 performing beneficial activities for beings. So again, the four negativities are classically

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:30.080
 brought up into, we're avoiding things, we're just, we're not going to lie.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.320
 Of course, there's many other precepts we're going by. And I'll just add, we're not going to lie.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:43.920
 And in particular, we're not going to use our speech to deceive anyone, but particularly

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.360
 our teachers, our elders, those who we truly honor.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:58.400
 So we're not going to deceive, deceive. And what are we going to do? We're going to act,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.640
 we're going to speak truthfully, truthfully to everyone. But then again, especially those we

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:15.600
 honor, those who have helped us, our elders, our teachers, the noble ones. And then we're not going

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:34.320
 to make people feel regretful. There's no need to guilt trip anybody. Instead, we're going to

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:44.320
 encourage ourselves, encourage each other in meaningful ways, even in working with our

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:54.720
 challenges, especially in working with our challenges. And we're not going to criticize

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:03.200
 if we fall into being criticizing and talking shade about, you know, anyone, but especially

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.040
 sincere practitioners and noble beings. And if someone hears that, or they hear it,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:23.040
 we've broken it if we've. And then the fourth thing we're going to avoid is our cunning

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:32.240
 ego tricks of really kind of in a cunning way, manipulating others in order to kind of get our,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:42.240
 you know, less savory agendas taken care of. And so we're going to avoid that, then we're going to

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:54.000
 engage in just honest compassion and uncontried, no agenda giving according to how we can.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.760
 And then the second morality, morality that gathers all virtues. That's essentially,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:11.280
 again, looking more at the actualizing practices. When we actually are practicing, meditating,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:19.360
 studying, meditating, practicing. And then again, within the frame of our bodhicattva training,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.600
 training in the six paramitas, actualizing our bodhicitta,

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:35.520
 uprooting our ego clinging, increasing our wisdom, bringing out our good qualities

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:44.480
 and beneficial qualities. And then there's actually the action of doing beneficial activities

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.320
 besides the beneficial activities of our own study, contemplation and practice.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:58.640
 The practice of just doing beneficial things. And the four, I think four guidelines around

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:09.600
 doing beneficial things we can look at is be generous, give what we can. If someone needs

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.760
 something and it's something we can give, then we give again, give without any need for getting

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:27.360
 anything back or any sense of outcome. And then in our verbal activities, speaking meaningfully

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:36.000
 and gently and respectfully, kindly, you know, and as much as we can be aware of

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:45.040
 especially sensitive spots with people, then that's another. So speaking meaningfully, kindly,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.880
 and then we also want to always act within our own capacities. We want to be skillful in our

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:59.920
 activities. We want to be kind of really aware of what's within our capacity to give and do.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:08.480
 But also it's equally and really important too, to develop our abilities, to be aware of

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:19.040
 and giving to people what they actually need and according to their readiness and their capacities

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:26.800
 on whatever level. That's a very important training. I think we've all experienced

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:36.160
 different fumblings with that, you know. And then the fourth is just being an ordinary

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.480
 person, being equal, recognizing we're all in the same boat.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:51.520
 They all have the same beautiful nature and we're all, at least I'm an ordinary being.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:35:02.880
 So just that, just kind of just being straightforward, open, honest, equal, you know,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.240
 not taking a higher than thou attitude or a lower than thou attitude necessarily,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:18.160
 but walking our talk, you know, actually having our actions really reflect our true motivation

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:27.520
 and vice versa. So that's that. And then of course, as I've said this, I'm thinking how,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.440
 I wouldn't call it quite hypocritical, but we all have a long way to go. You know, I certainly do.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:43.120
 And because we are, I am a sentient being, just at the very beginning of the path,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.160
 that means I have lots of obscurations and lots of habitual patterns that

00:35:49.760 --> 00:36:01.200
 do create more trouble for myself and others. So here we are. And when we make this really

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:08.080
 big commitment before all the noble ones, and we do have downfalls where we do,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.880
 due to different reasons, make mistakes and fall into our negative habitual patterns,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:23.120
 get caught up in our sneaky ego tricks, you know, as soon as we become aware of that,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:30.000
 then we purify and restore our vows. And that's why it's so good to, as much as we can,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.240
 restore our bodhicitta motivation, our joy and appreciation, our devotion with all of that.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.000
 And that can be done, of course, within our nundra practice. In a way, we're doing that

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.360
 in our bodhisattva section. And then definitely we can be purifying our bodhisattva downfalls

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:58.080
 during our Vadrasattva practice, for sure. And then if we want to do additionally to that,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:06.160
 we have also every 10th day when we have our ganachakra ceremony, the stainless king and the

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:15.280
 Vadrasattva practice we do there, that's definitely purifying. It's purifying all the mistakes and

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:21.120
 downfalls we've had in every level of our training, in our pratimoksha training, our bodhisattva

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.360
 training, our Vajrayana training, and the vows and commitments we've, we're refreshing and

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:38.960
 correcting any kind of misuse we've had. And we want to maintain that all as much as we can,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:48.320
 being mindful, alert, conscientious. So I really should stop talking.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:38:03.600
 I hope that was helpful. There's so much to say around bodhichitta. One thing I'm going to

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.240
 recommend another really good book around bodhichitta. It's a really beautiful,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:17.920
 beautiful book, so inspiring. It's like, what is bodhichitta? How big is bodhichitta?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:26.560
 It's vast as the heavens, deep as the sea. But this book, it's published by Wisdom.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:37.040
 It's by great, really great, so precious master of, you know, the last century, Kunurumpashe.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:46.800
 It has a biography of him. This is his verses in praise of bodhichitta. And it's just so,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:55.520
 so beautiful. It has the Tibetan and in a beautiful translation. It just goes on and on and on,

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:04.720
 praising bodhichitta. It's so vast. But also Kunurumpashe was not only this totally sublime,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:14.320
 realized meditation master, Vajrayana master. He was so scholarly. And so it's the kind of praise

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.640
 and beauty you read. And it's telling us about the path and it gets you curious like, Oh, what is

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:20.960
 this?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:31.920
 So anyway, let's keep our bodhichitta. And I opened up this randomly, this famous quote he

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.160
 brings out about the qualities of bodhichitta. No matter where we are now, no matter again,

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:48.080
 keeping that motivation and that aspiration and doing everything we can to protect and nurture

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:55.040
 that is so important. So even if a diamond is broken, it does not stop being called a diamond.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:01.760
 Similarly, even flashes of bodhichitta do not stop being called bodhichitta.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.600
 It's a beautiful book, vast as the heavens, deep as the sea by Kunurumpashe.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:21.120
 So thank you for sitting through that. I hope it's helpful. And please, I know someone else wrote

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:35.200
 too. I kind of addressed some questions you put there. I think that was from Kristin wrote too,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.560
 asking some questions so that, you know, I'll try to get in touch with both Julie and Kristin,

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.080
 but I thought addressing some answers here and then we can talk more in person too.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:57.760
 So thank you. We'll do our No-Draw practice now. Thank you.
