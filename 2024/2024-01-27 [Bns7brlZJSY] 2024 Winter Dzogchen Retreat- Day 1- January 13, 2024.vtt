00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much again, participating. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.600
 much. You're welcome, everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone, for participation, your

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.380
 time and effort and joyful effort to the Dharma and making all this kind of happen. So I'm thankful

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.000
 you all.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.290
 It is also very virtuous. It's Dharma, it's practice. You can dedicate that merit for all different

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.810
 reasons, different levels to bring joy and peace, happiness, well-being, fulfillment to every

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.690
 single living beings. And then also in this world, really thinking of all different things

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.000
 happening and to natural level and human level, so many things.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.130
 So we wish that what we're doing together in our even short moment of the good conception, good

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.840
 thought, virtue thought, made that have the ripple effect to help and support to bring peace and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 calm and respect and appreciate everywhere.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.760
 Really wish the sincerity that is our kind of vows or when we take the bodhicata vows, we say that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.000
 we will help to every living beings until they reach enlightenment.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.430
 That world is we pronounce the right in front of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and as

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.930
 well as all the Bodhisattvas and human teacher, also maybe many Sangha members in the teaching

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 office said that when we take the bodhicata vows,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 always there is so many also individual beings, God, and Asura, Dharvapala is watching. So we said

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 we will do that. And so this is again, we kind of activated those thoughts.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.610
 And all those great masters said that well, you're keeping up the practice of bodhicata, that you

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.000
're keeping up the actualizing or engaging bodhicata in the teaching.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.610
 Those are very practical looks like so simple and small kind of all it is not it's so tiny is not

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.000
 insignificant, but no, it's really special.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 So have all those beautiful thought and intention, even the smallest things that we do to virtues

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 or Dharma activity kind of thinking with that all the different levels to all the sentient beings

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.000
 is just excellent is excellent.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.420
 Really in the teaching said, and the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, if he's here, we will

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.000
 think, oh, I'm sure he's here too, but we don't see that through our also too many defilement.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.510
 Otherwise, he will say that noble son and a noble daughter, well done, well done, well done. Yeah,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.000
 really, it will announce that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 So that to that, again, so those things really so simple. Okay, thank you very much again.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.350
 And so we kind of activate it with those beautiful intentions. And then we go to this our retreat,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.690
 of course, we're getting together during the retreat retreat because it's very in the world retreat

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.000
.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 I believe this means, means that we are retreating from the our mundane duality activities we're

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.100
 retreating to where we retreat into the spiritual in natural college of the our beauty of the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.100
 Buddha nature that we all inherited and reactivated that not led that spoiled by the habit patterns

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.000
 of the so many times we did and so many lifetimes we did.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.910
 So trying to retreat, we trying to reverse our course, course, and that is and following the put

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.420
 steps of the gracious teacher Buddha Shakyamuni and the gracious teacher, Gaurup and Masambhava, as

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.380
 well as all the linear master following their put steps, take them as role models, role models, and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.000
 we follow our best capabilities.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.020
 That's what it's called retreat, I think, and actually on the taking of the retreat means, November

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:17.730
, November in Tibet, or London, November, Singapore, yeah, London, November, and Singapore, November

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.000
, that's what I'm using to be the word.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.890
 And that means a retreat our physical activity from the mundane, our engaging physical activities

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.520
 and retreat our mind from mundane our conceptions of the emotions, the negative emotions, and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.860
 coming back to the virtuous attitude, the virtuous thoughts, love, kindness, the compassion, joy in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.000
 respect, appreciation and devotion.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.190
 Those are the teaching said so that's what really we're doing trying to kind of keep up those

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.870
 thoughts with that and then we follow the teaching again, when you follow the teaching, of course,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.000
 again, always in the teaching said, we should bring up more joy in the applications.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.220
 We have so many reason to feel joy and happy, happy being in human beings, and also have all the 18

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.340
 endowments in the Buddha teaching mentioned, said, how fortunate in the teaching, I'm using the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:23.230
 teaching I'm not saying this, my word, please, how fortunate to be have the devotion to Dharma and

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.000
 reflecting the teachings,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.460
 teachings, these opportunities, they're not easy to come even in 100 years. That's what what I said

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.650
, really, so we should feel happy in the joy, joy, when we have the opportunity to activating

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.000
 something beautiful things.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.650
 What means beautiful things, we are activating beautiful of lowing kindness, compassion, joy,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:58.410
 respect and appreciation. That is the beauty. That is our shrine. That is the absolute, our Buddha

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.620
 or Dharma and the Sangha, we're activating that we're not discussing something, how to trick the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.000
 others that take advantage and kind of do those kind of smart activities in some study called.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.760
 We're not talking that we don't come down to the ground on the floor on this and trying to

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.990
 cultivate in something beautiful, our nature of the lowing kindness, the competition. And this is

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.000
 really so special.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.150
 For that reason, it's really so careful, happy in the joy and the appreciation, all those kind of

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.090
 bring up this and the same time, activating that with this happy in the joy, with both each other

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.000
 and thinking of this, what I'm doing this may benefit all living beings really truly, not just

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 seeing that world on the here, but from heart, really saying,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.770
 may this teaching benefit for all living beings, may teaching that benefit to me. So I, what do we

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.350
 call open, mature the one's own mind, mature one's own mind. What that means, the spirit of our

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:11.000
 mind is very wild. It's not mature. It's not calm, not peace.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.720
 It's just tons and tons of habit, loaded. It's like wild wind. It just has also no order. It's just

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.580
 a regularity. Really, it is. I mean, this is not just a Buddha saying and the teaching said, check

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.000
 ourselves.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.630
 Even short moment, when we meditate in the practice, our mind can't stay. How much money? I mean,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:42.490
 ask ourselves. Even with all the token teachings, even with all the Maha Mother teachings, even we

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:49.000
're doing the meditation, the practice of that, that and the regularization come, religion, stage,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.840
 practice, all those fences along in some more practice, all that, but when we come to checking one

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.000
's own mind, ourself, by me,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.340
 by one's own self, our mind is really very regularities. And when you're regular, the way the mind

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.000
 is going, we check most of the time to the emotions, habit of it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.830
 Something has to do with the emotions, attachment or conditioned head of thought. Head of thought,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:24.150
 I'm not saying angry to that thought, but just kind of like rejection, acceptance. This kind of

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.000
 discrimination attitude is really happening.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.830
 That is the turbulence of the mind, turbulence of the habit of happiness. That, we had that before

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:44.340
 we met the Dharma or Razi, the teaching, and we continue to do that. Then is something we have to

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.000
 really fix. We have to do it. And then many times we get some kind of, oh, it's not walking that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.730
 It's not walking. We feel a little bit uncomfortable or disappointment or excitement is slowing

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:03.060
 down and all that. And then just kind of like before our kind of start, let it bloom, flying on the

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.000
 sky and this and that and all that.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.160
 Now the blooms, that air is going down and dropping down on the floor and it looks completely like

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:23.420
 this. Why? Because it's some of the oxygens of Dharma is reducing. Oxygen of Dharma is joy and

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:32.450
 appreciation, love and devotion, bodhicitta, understanding of the nature of the samsaras, samsara

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.000
 qualities, samsara situations.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.930
 Really? Then kind of we've carried the force by our mundane world, but we've always been carried

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:47.440
 the force and our Dharma side has become like that. And then sometimes we'll be, oh, it's not

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.000
 walking, not walking. Can't realize, start thinking of something is not walking.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.280
 But it surely is, we're not drawing the correct way. It works. 100% is guaranteed money back. No, I

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.780
'm not saying that. I shouldn't say those. But it's guaranteed. It really involves all these

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.000
 practitioners.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.520
 It's all this what we call great masters. They are not just came and born with great masters. They

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:28.950
 are practitioners. Read their life stories. Many of those translated, how their courage, commitment

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:36.310
, loyalty to the Dharma, loyalty to the Buddha, loyalty to the Sangha, never complaining, never

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.000
 questioning that.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.350
 Really? Once they settled, their courage and commitment is so strong as a solid mountain. And

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:52.000
 devotion and love is so vast and deep as sky and an ocean. Haven't it?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:10.380
 And then the beauty of the nature of one's own true nature. That's okay. Absolute nature shines,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.230
 bullying as the sun and dispel the all the darkness of the ignorance and habit that fired up so

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.000
 many lifetimes is completely counter deciphering and it's truly become then the hero, the greatest

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 stars and warriors in the samsara.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Not worried that defeated with anger and emotion and negative something that not did by the love

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and the compassion understand the nature of the mind nature of this phenomenon.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.950
 Then truly they become the most richest persons of the all the wealth they got the whole universe

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:47.880
 and become wealth, not just collecting in a scandal and trying to get and with the emotion, the

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.000
 whole day.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.140
 The whole day, what they in the teaching said treasured door of the sky is open, completely

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:06.910
 everything is really so powerful, so luxury, full of love, joy, contentment, and then realizations

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.000
 of this.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.200
 At all have this because this we throw the practice on the body and therefore it's kind of bring up

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.000
 really with more body just a thought, joy and appreciation for the body.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.790
 And then this time, of course, it's okay to teach us. Okay. Teaching is the very inner teaching or

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:33.040
 the highest teaching of teaching mentioned with the highest teaching, teaching that but I ever give

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.000
 all well give.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.480
 There's nothing higher than the Dzokki teaching in the teaching often mentioned and as well as all

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.000
 those great master or those realize that being some mentioned that so we're following that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.420
 And the Dzokki teaching is then see everything as in a perfect three wages stated at three guys

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:55.000
 status, all the forms are.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.670
 The mark is and all the song systems are the some book is in all the mind and the spaces are the Dh

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:12.000
armaka status, the externally that three guys did inwardly in a three guys status.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.480
 So that is the really the realizations on day that is the what we're going to bring the realization

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.000
 reality level.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.890
 All these three guys see already here, according to Dzokki teaching is not something that we have

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:34.970
 to go and get, but we have to practice it, why, due to the our negative it is or the defilement and

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.000
 habit patterns of the duality is completely blocked.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.220
 It's like tight clothes in the sky. So you won't see the beauty of the sky, the stars, the moon,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.000
 and sun completely covered.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.080
 And who created that type of clothes once on date, duality, habit patterns to have to clear away

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.000
 that order to clear way that we do the practice and meditating that that will clear away.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.110
 Once is a clear way, then the beauty of the nature really shines perfectly beautiful. Everything is

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.000
 within that nature status or nature of the mind.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.560
 So therefore, to kind of open up those thoughts, open up that situation, that is even in the

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:31.480
 beginning time, we should start can have more pure perceptions of purity, understand of the reality

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.700
, the way the things are, or where subjects are, where objects are, can really open it with that

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:44.000
 role is leaning toward the then to bring the full understanding of the nature.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.650
 So beauty or the enlightenment, those are the teachings said now with those kind of with beautiful

00:14:49.650 --> 00:15:00.000
 motivation, beautiful intentions, then we go to the to the now this this teaching, this teaching is

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 translated.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.200
 And I'm going to, of course, the who taught again, this is the teaching of the by the great master,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.460
 my home, which is that that but but again, to go this, this, of course, many of you already know

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.000
 them.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.670
 How much is and who taught ordinary this teaching by great teacher, but I have to manage who came

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:28.110
 to thousand 600 years ago around it that's just a, there's so many different technology systems or

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:33.000
 so many different ways, they count in the Buddhist schools, but more than

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.450
 more than time, understandably, everybody is a follow me that to about 2500 or 600 years ago, but

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:48.340
 otherwise, there's even longer than that. That means, over that period, the Buddha came in this

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.000
 world.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.500
 So whatever, but now about two thousand five years or 600 years ago, gracious teacher, brother was

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:07.000
 came and in India or emanated in India, and then around age 29, then he left the kingdom.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:22.340
 And then he practiced and meditated for six years, and age 35, he left the kingdom, as 29, and got

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:32.000
 enlightenment of fully enlightenment that he demonstrated at age 35.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.480
 So, and after that seven weeks after his enlightenment, he started to the will of Dharma, that's

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:47.340
 what offering in the teaching mentioned, but that means, but I started giving the teachings,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.000
 sharing the teaching to the others.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.350
 Seven weeks after post the teaching is the teachings on the cause and the conditions, and their

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:07.560
 relationships, cause and the condition and also sorry, cause and the condition, affect result, and

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.000
 their relationships.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.830
 So the relationship is made in the Buddhism, often said, they never knew what in a to be the world,

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:21.130
 and maybe you know, or otherwise, it is interdependent or ordination or interconnected

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:27.000
 interconnected.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:37.410
 There's nothing is happening without interconnecting many together come to the post support to take

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:46.900
 one result. There's so many interconnections, so many connections, and developing that, and this is

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:53.000
 that we don't trade that connection without the cause and the condition.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.370
 Things are not going to see anything this way that all happening, that all happening within the

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:10.870
 vastness of the emptiness states, all that happening, therefore, since is all happening on the

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:16.000
 emptiness, and through the interconnection of the cause and the conditions,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.950
 and the things that are developing magically, for those reasons, open and Buddhism said it is all

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.000
 magical, is all magical.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.430
 It's there's ever you started trying to look the search, finding the fact of the how is developing,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.000
 how it is connecting is so mysterious.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.110
 There's nothing to really experience, even the modern scientists, even the modus come from physics,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:55.510
 I don't can explain exactly how things happen in the deep dome, and the medical level, particle

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.000
 level, or even beyond the particle level.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 How that happening, but yet things happening that we see, are we are here to.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 That's called magical disciplines.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And often Buddha use the magical dream like mirage reflection on the moon in the water. Those are

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.690
 not just fancy kind of like trying to see what they're trying to trick our mind, trying to trick

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.000
 our mind.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.290
 They are truly is all. That's why in the teaching optimization, those great master who have

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:42.000
 perfectly realize that they can walk walk through the walls.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 They can standing on the air, or sleeping, lying, sitting for activities, they can perform.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Because the nature is flexible.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Nature is open.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.360
 That's the in the teaching said, and those good master open said, when you have realization with

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.000
 that, then they can do.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 That means they mastered exactly where things are.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Those are not magic. Those are not trying to trick things.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 As is happening, happening.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So therefore, this is the Buddha give that first teaching is a full novel through the teachings.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 And which is again, I said, cause and condition.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 It is a result.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 How producing result that which is interconnected.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 And then second big seminary teachings. I'm just really I'm sure you all heard this.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.020
 You all know this. You already know, but it's not just annoying, which always really the reflecting

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.000
 the teaching.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.250
 Think that again in Buddhism that being grateful to the lineage, being grateful to the teacher, the

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.000
 gracious teacher Buddha is so important.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 We think what I'm talking is not just I'm talking because I got those things.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 No, I learned a little bit from migrate master's teachers in a book.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 So all those are linear masters is continued.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 So that means two thousand six hundred years ago, this teaching is still continuing that somebody

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 must walk so hard with their love and joy to preserve this until now.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 So we should thankful to all of them, really, all the practitioners, all those great masters.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Behold them. These teachings won't be here right now and this throughout the generations.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 It's not just the one man's power happening or few man's power happening.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 We're all following the light of the Buddha's according our best capabilities.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 And some of the linear masters, linear masters.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.580
 So therefore, and the second big seminary teaching of the is then known as the teachings on the

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.000
 absolute truth.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Now, but I give the cause and the conditions and a result and their connections.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:39.830
 Second teaching is then nature of that nature of the cause, nature of the conditions, nature of the

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.000
 interconnections.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 But the great teachings that emphasize that is a nature nature.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.630
 What nature means behind the scene, we see cause, we see conditions, we see the resolvers, we see

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.000
 the interconnections, something connecting that happening.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 We kind of roughly understand that.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:14.460
 But some day we don't see. That is a nature. Behind the scene, nature is the great emptiness, the

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:20.000
 openness, infinite freedom, nature.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 That is absolute truth. We call in the Buddha teaching absolute truth.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.660
 Why is called absolute truth? Because this is not going to change. It's there. It's there, whatever

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.000
 that is.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 It's there. It's not going to change. It's absolute, truly.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 The above code absolute in the Tibetan is called tuntamba demba, tuntamba. It is in the Tibetan

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 world is sanskrit translated from those great masters, translators in the eighth centuries.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:11.010
 And pramam arta, I think sanskrit, pramam art, pram is supreme. Earth means meaning, supreme

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.000
 meaning of truth.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:26.630
 And we translate it. In English we translate it absolute truth. But in Sanskrit we translate it

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.000
 that English. Supreme truth, true.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 No, it's not a truth. Supreme, supreme meaning of truth.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Supreme meaning of truth. In the Tibetan, true, translated tuntamba demba. Tunt means meaning.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Tambam means supreme or holy special. Dema means truth.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 In English, translate it as absolute truth. Tunt means what? Tunt. Tunt means this.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Tunt means the supreme meaning. There's nothing more meaningful than these realizations.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 And tambam means supreme wise. There's nothing higher realization than this or higher than this.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 And then why is it called demba? Truth. Because it's true.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 On the realization level, maybe it's not true for the conception, duality level, that.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 But when you got understand the meaning of this, this, nature, then it's true.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:49.020
 How when we see that, according to suttara teaching at post-Bhumi, post-Bhumi stages, before that,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.000
 according to suttara level, we can understand that intellectually.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.740
 Through analytics, through analyzings, we can see. Those are just analytic realization of the

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.000
 supreme.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 But perfect when you see it, post-Bhumi.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 When in a dukki teaching stage, it's not going out of skirt in a dukkin.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Going to your own mind or our own mind. Not looking to the different phenomena.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 That means not looking the emptiness of the aggregates.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Not looking the emptiness of the particular aggregates, such as poem aggregates.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Looking to your own, one's own mind.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 When you look to your own mind, immediately we really go to the speechless status.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Immediately, we think, "Where is my mind?"

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 And we don't have any answers. Each of us is speechless.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 That is the analytic realization of the emptiness.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:17.580
 But then, in the teaching opening, the dukki said, "When you look to the mind, look to the mind by

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.000
 the look to the looker."

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 When you look to the looker, that moment, according to the great masters in the dukki teaching,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 he said, "That moment you're going to experience or you're getting realization of the short time

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 for one second."

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.810
 But then, it is the kind of window of light of the realization came short time because powerful

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.000
 techniques.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Techniques explode, but then it's called by the duality again, that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 So that is really like, you see, that means, in the teaching said,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 "That moment, when you look to the lookers, looker, that moment, subject to object are lost."

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Lost it. Completely lost it.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Where? The natural status.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 That is a glimpse of the true nature, the ultimate nature of the rupa, dukki status.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 But rather, of course, in the suttara teaching, my own suttara teaching, explaining externally,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.650
 and poems and all that, and for those reasons, in the Pandya Parama, the suttara, such as the heart

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.000
 suttara,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 the Adya Pandya Parama, the suttara, is 100,000 standard teachings.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And the short one is, the condensed one, is 25 strands of Pandya Parama, the teaching,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 which are often named as the heart suttas.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And there, we see, Buddha is teaching. Poem is emptiness.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And it is started from the poem.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Then, feeling, and the perception, and the conception, and consciousness, consciousness is lost.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Gross level, Buddha brings the understanding down to the most subtle level.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And then, Buddha went, "No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue." All that.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Why this is saying, "We have eye, we have ear, we have nose, we have everything."

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Why Buddha said, "No eye, no." Buddha is, we think, whenever we think, "It's crazy."

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Maybe they think, if they don't have any kind of experience of the Buddhist,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 and think of the, "Oh, no eye, no tongue, no." This is a balloon.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 It's just a balloon. I think it must be something happening. What is that?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But Buddha is talking on the absolute level.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 The brahma-arth-sattya level, tone-dumb-demo level.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 There is nothing existing that we can cling to.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 There is eye, there is ear, there is nose, there is tongue.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 But they are not existing as what we believed, as duality things.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 It's all as magic. All interconnected, they exist, inter-dependent things.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 So that's what Buddha gives that teaching.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Then, so that is mainly teaching on the absolute truth.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 And the third turning wheel of Dharma is according to teaching in my schools,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 where Buddhism is a combination of the two teachings.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 In a way, two teachings. I'm sure you heard, many of you know.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 You know, "trandung" and "gidung" in the Tibetan world.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 "Trandung" means interpretable meanings.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And "gidung" means the ultimate meanings.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So Buddha gave two teachings.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 "Trandung" is interpretable meaning teaching, such as post-teachings.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 It's interpretable. That means Buddha says everything is existing.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Cause and condition and result and interconnections and all that.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Buddha gives extensively that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 That means interpretable meanings.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 "Trandung" is because Buddha gave those teachings to assure us to the Dharma,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 assuring teachings.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 It's not that something that is final teaching. It's assuring teaching.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Because we are so, so attracted, so lean to these things.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 All are here in the world. World things here, we're lean.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And for that reason, Buddha gave to assuring teachings on the cause and condition,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 teachings on the Karmas and teachings on all that.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 And the interconnected, all that. So it isn't that.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And the ultimate level, they are not really adjusted as Buddha taught.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Solid levels. It's all magical existence.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 So therefore, this third chain of turning wheel of Dharma is the interpretable meaning,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 combination of the interpretable meaning and the ultimate meanings.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 And then, so the ultimate meaning is what?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 This Brahma art, "Tundamba Demba."

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 "Tundamba Demba," when we're talking "Tundamba Demba,"

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 thinking of now, Buddha went from the emptiness, ultimate meaning, Brahma art,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 "Sattaya" or "Tundamba Demba," absolute level.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And Buddha now coming to the third turning wheel of Dharma, Buddha coming to direct to the mind.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Two. Second. Two teachings. Again, I'm thinking second.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Interpretable meaning, teaching, and ultimate teachings.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Or uninterpretable meaning, ultimate teachings.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Ultimate teaching and interpretable meaning, teaching.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 The ultimate meaning of the teaching is then Buddha give the teachings on the nature of the mind.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 How is the nature of the mind?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 In the first turning wheel of Dharma, Buddha explained, "It is all empty."

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 All empty. It is true.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 When we can see, glimpse ourselves when we do the analytic ways.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Or we ask where is our mind? I said earlier, you know, too.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 We can't say anything. It's meaningless. It's empty.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 There's nothing we can explain.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 But that emptiness is not blank emptiness, not negation emptiness.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 That is fullness. Empty is fullness, completely full.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 So what in the teaching, in the great master Mohanram which he said,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 post-teaching, explaining, not personal, second teaching,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 explain the nature of the mind, of the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Explaining, all is empty. The second turning, sorry, third turning wheel of Dharma,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 explaining the call it of emptiness mind. Call it.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 That's clarity. Clarity aspect of the nature of mind.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 That means what? Clarity aspect of the nature of mind is that all the call it of the mind

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 are already within the emptiness nature of the mind.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 What are call it? Love, compassion, versitim, understanding, knowledge.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 All those are call it richness.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Those are just simple ones. I'm talking about the higher ones.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 All the five guys, five versitims, are already in the emptiness nature of the mind.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 That is known as in the third turning wheel of Dharma, Buddha's teaching,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 dhatan ghatan garbha, that you heard, I heard, nature of the Buddha.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Nature of Buddha is, natural level is empty. There's nothing to hold.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Yet, call it the richness level is full chaos and the versitims.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya, all there.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And versitim level, five versitims, dharmadattu versitims,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 merrel-like versitims, equanimity versitims, and discrimination,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 awareness versitims, all accomplishing versitims.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 All that five, that five versitims can be summarized into two.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 The versitims that understand all the phenomena exist exactly as it is,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and the versitims that understand all the nature of the phenomena exactly as it is.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 In a debate, chyattawa, chemba, chenyapan chemba, those are exactly as it is.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 The knowledge and versitim of the Buddha has no, no shortages, no blockages,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 no blockages by the time and the space. It's beyond.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Nature is open.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 That explaining the third turning wheel of dharma,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 that is not just only kind of reserved by the certain group of peoples.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 The gracious teacher pronounce it, announce it with the line's roles

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 that every single living being have that Buddha nature.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 No one is missing or lack of that nature.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 So that means we all have that nature, everyone.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Therefore, we can be bright, bright, bright eyes and bushy tails, definitely.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 We have all that. What do we have to do now?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 We have to walk, to discover that qualities.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 But in time, our that nature is blocked by the obscurations.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Obscurations, what?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Emotion obscurations relate with the ego clings, emotion obscurations.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Self-important, self-centered mind.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Those are all known as emotion obscurations.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 And it's a bit, nyumum pudjapa or in the teaching method.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And knowledge obscurations, second is.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 And then knowledge obscurations is attracted to the subject and objects.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Even the anti-dodo practices, meditations, we attach it.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Attach it. Those are knowledge obscurations.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 But suppose what we have to walk.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 In front, we walk in the practical level for the beginner practitioners,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 such as many of us, we walk for the emotional levels.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 We try how to remove that obscurations.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Then in the greatest teaching, the Buddha is teaching all the great masters,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 one voice, to the two meditary activities.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Accumulation merits and wisdom merits.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Not swinging back and forth, keep union.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Not emphasizing on the earth, the accumulation merit is more important than that.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 All relative, sorry, wisdom merit is more important.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Both are equally important.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Keep that balance.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 We did a little accumulation merit.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Accumulation in the Tibetan is called,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 I'm just using the Tibetan word.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 I thought maybe many of you know already.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 So in Tibetan it's called saonam jecho.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Tab saonam jecho.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Onam jef saonam jecho.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Nam mi jecho in the Tibetan word.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Nam jim is the appearance, accumulation merit that can be appeared

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 to our eyes, to our ears, to our nose, to our tongue,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 or to appearance, can see, we can see.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 That's all accumulation.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 What is those? We highlight that.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Those are among the six parameters.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Fourth, poor parameters are the appearance, accumulation, merit practices.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 And second merit is wisdom merit, commonly, and I'm using today,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 again I use Nam mi, the invisible merit.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 What's the invisible? That means when we meditate,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 when we are meditating on the jokin or when we meditate,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 we really, nobody can see anything.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 And we're just sitting, sitting.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 We're like pros ands, pros ands, we're sitting.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 But inwardly, we're relaxing, calm and at peace,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 and expanding our understanding to the natures, beauty, infinite status.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 That is something you don't see.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Even you cannot see immediately until you wear it like that.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 So it's nam mi jecho, it's the wisdom merit.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Both are union status.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 That way, purify all the obscurations.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 So this tathanga, the teaching, then Buddha taught, this teaching is Mahayana,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 the Mahayana teaching.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 And then Buddha taught that from all the way this emptiness,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 and as well as the tathanga, the teaching of this what we're discussing,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Buddha taught all the way to up to the jokin.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 That is essential way to discover these teachings, meanings.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 So that's really how it is.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 So this is the, among these teachings,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 the first, the second, and the third teachings are all connected.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 The second teaching is connected to the first teaching.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Without the first teaching of this first Buddha teaching, second teaching won't be completed.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 Without the second teaching, first and second teaching,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 third teaching is not complete teaching.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 So it's all connected, really connected, one after another.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And so therefore, it all follows one goal,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 goal to discover our inner nature.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 This tathanga dangabha, inner nature, why I'm using inner nature,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 but if I use tathanga dangabha, this Buddha nature,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 all these teachings are designed to discover our Buddha nature.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Really that's all.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 And the ultimate technique is the jokin, come according to the teaching.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So this great, among these teachings,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 and then this, now this teaching is continually until

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 all those great masters continue until now.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Now, and this is teaching, is then taught by this particular teaching

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 we call, what we call is the teaching of the, of the great master, Mohanramudj.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 And Mohanramudj was one of the great masters.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 In the many great masters these days I saw,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 so I read the books of the different masters.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Mohanramudj is like equally so special with the great master,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 and as well as great master Rongzumpa.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Maybe many of you did not heard Rongzumpa many times,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 or you may be heard.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 Rongzumpa, R-O-N-G-Z-O-M-P-A Rongzumpa, that's called, Rongzumpa.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 And many of the teachings mentioned Rongzumpa Panditas as great scholars.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Rongzumpa was born in the 11th century.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Around the beginning of the 11th century, once.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 But he was a calm bone with great wisdoms, not his start.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 The moment he born, say this, when his baby's time,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 he started speaking Sanskrit languages, Sanskrit languages.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 And mothers, I don't understand why, why he's, what he's talking,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 strange thing, he must be something wrong,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 or maybe many villages, things, things, or maybe he's some kind of,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 he was influenced by the local spirit, spirit.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 That's what he's talking, all these strange words, teaching that.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 So then, one time in the teaching, in the life story,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 he said that mother, because that time, Atihye came to Tibet,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 a great master, great Indian master came to Tibet,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 he came to the center of Tibet.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Of course, he came to the upper part of the, the north part of the Tibetans,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 then gray or northwest, sorry, north-north, west part of the Tibet.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 And then gradually, afterward, he came to the center of Tibet.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 When he came to the center of Tibet,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 the Rongzongma mother told baby Rongzongma to see, to Atishas.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 And in the life story, he said that when Rongzongma mother told to Atisha,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 and this, my baby, is very kind of strange,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 he's talking something very unusual,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 thinks he talks and he don't, what happened, and could you, could you,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 can tell me, and please bless him, so he will become more normal,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 calmer, calmer, calmer, calmer, could you bless that?

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 And Atishas looked to him, and Atishas spoke to him in Sanskrit languages.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 And Rongzongma, the baby Rongzongma answered, answered that.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 And then, that moment, Atisha picked up the baby from the mother's hand

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 and hold to his, tore to him, and touch to his head.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 All this is, I cannot discuss with this young man,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 he is immediately reburd or emanation of the great indeed Maha Siddha,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 called the Nako Joppa, Nako Joppa, great master Nako Joppa.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Oh Krishna, he's very famous.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 I think his color must be black.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Black, in South India, I heard there's big caves of this,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 it must also become very, very big yogi, realization master's,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 and one of the 84 master's, and then as well as he has so many students,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 and the entourage, entourage.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 So, I think he is immediately incarnational or emanational Nako,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 but I cannot discuss Dharma with him, I cannot discuss.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 So, it turns out that Nako Joppa, that great master,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 is also teacher of the Atisha too.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 So, this is the word of that.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 So, he was, when he was young,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 I mean he becomes so, he is so learned.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 He translated also many Vadiyana teachings to Tibet.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 He was one of the later translations, early translators,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 and later translators.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 So, Rungzuma was a later translator.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 He was, and he was a great yogi, practitioner of the Maha, Vadiyakalaya.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 And he wrote so many commentaries, I mean so many teachings,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 many teachings, a lot.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 So, even he wrote, and the life story said,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 he wrote how to do the, how to keep the palmers,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 palmers, palms, and the daily products,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 how to preserve the daily products, all those things,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 because he really wrote so many.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 But now, of course, many of those are gone.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Gone, and Mohan Ramaji, great master Mohan Ramaji,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 wrote some introductions and collected,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 I mean many great other masters collected the teachings,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 so he wrote that introduction and put the,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 in the context of the volumes, like in the 16, 16 wars.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 In Sanskrit, has about 16 wars.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 A, E, U, U, that we joined, that war wars.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 I think it has about 16 wars.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 And Mohan Ramaji put the title, the past volume,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 E, E, like that.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 So, he encouraged everyone, if you find his teaching,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 add with this and put, all the 16 wars are completed.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 I mean he wrote those introductions.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 So, this is the great master Mohan Ramaji.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 And he is one of the great scholars, masters in the, in the debate.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 And then, in the 13th century, great master Mohan Ramaji.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And that is Dokki, Dokki masters and scholars.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 Again, he kind of, in the Tibetan, in Dokki's teaching,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 often he said that Garab, Lungjimba is the second Garab Dorji,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 or Lungjimba is Garab Dorji of Tibet.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Tibet, that's really in the teaching sense.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 So, Garab Dorji of India, who discovered,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 or who bought the Dokki teaching on this earth.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 And then the Buddha give already those teachings, already in the level.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 That Garab Dorji bought that in the teachings, and on this level.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 And then, Lungjimba was the Tibetan Garab Dorji.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 He was so famous, scholars, and scholars.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 He didn't understand the knowledge, memorized,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 the entire Buddha teachings, they called.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 And he has so many that, just when he was staying

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 in Sangpu Neutok, the great monastery college

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 at that time, in the center of Tibet,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 called Sangpu Neutok Great Monastery University.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 And he become one of the top scholars.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 And he went to, within the compass, compass,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 compass that he went to the many great scholars

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 and debated one after another that he become

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 really the top of the old great scholars.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 And then he left about those monastery schools

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 around age 27, and then pursued the practicing teachings.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 And then he met the great Dokki master.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 Oh, wow.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 He met the great Dokki master.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 And so, it is all the teachings.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 And as Lungjimba said, according to teaching,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 with the Kamaranda, about six years

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 started and resisted Dokki teachings.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 Dokki teachings, mind section Dokki teachings,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 space section Dokki teachings,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 and pit instruction sections of Dokki teachings.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 He received all that.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 According to the teaching or the life story,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Lungjimba's family was poor, and he was quite poor.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 And so, at the end of all the teachings,

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 then Lungjimba said,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 "I don't have any offering to big material things,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 but I will put this into the practices,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 and that is my offering to you, Kamaranda."

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 So that is, he meditated the practice.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Actually, in the teaching he said,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 "Well, he is sitting with the Kamaranda.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 He is already practicing that,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 not just receiving teaching, received teaching,

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 but he is practicing that.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 He got such high realization of the Dokki level.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 Then we left that, and he practiced it for over three years

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 in very, very ascetic ways in the Kanri Thokkari,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 in the center of Tibet."

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Again, very famous Philip Girmaj's portrait.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 He practiced three years,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 and then he reached to the ultimate level

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 of the Dokki status,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 or he completed all the poor, vegan stages.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 Dokki is in the Namjim Tharsambha.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 Chun-Yin Wonsam, Nyamne Kumpar, Rakwatsypi,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 and Chun-Yin Cesar.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 Those poor stages in the Dokki status,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 of course, many of you already know those,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 the process is called Chun-Yin Wonsam-Yin Stages.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Seeing true nature, exactly as it is,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 on the direct perception stage,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 not intellectuals, seeing the direct perceptions.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 And the second realization,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 and expanding the realization, expanding realization.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Third is, is reaching the peak of the awareness,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Rakwatsypi, peak of the awareness.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 And then, Chun-Yin Cesar, all the phenomenons are exalted,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 all the phenomenons are transcendent.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 And the Mune teaching says,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 the first two stages are realization of,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 we put that in the context of the three Gaias,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 Narmakaya, Sambokaya, and Dharmakaya.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 We put these four regions of Dokkins

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 in this three Gaya state.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 First, true.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 Chun-Yin Wonsam, seeing true nature,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 and exactly on the direct perception status,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 as well as expanding the vision,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 is experience of the realization of the Narmakaya, the Buddhas.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 And the third one, reaching the peak of the awareness,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 that is realization of the Sambokayas.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 And exhorting or finishing all the phenomenons, conceptions,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 that is Dharmakaya, realization.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Those are teachings.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 We keep on completing everything.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 He become one of the great Jokki masters

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 that knows all the Jokki teachings,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 or in the Jokki teacher's opening said,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 164,000 of Jokki Tantras.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 He knew all that.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Really, he knew all that.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 And then, the academic level, knowledge level,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 he knew all those things.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Not just the knowledge, but he got the realization.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Three Gaias within his life achieved.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 And therefore, Nongchima become, then,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 second Garab Doji or Garab Doji of Tibet in the teachings said.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 And he wrote all those teachings,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 that his realization expressed to order to benefit

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 for the followables of practice and bring clear understanding,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 general meaning of the Buddha teaching,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 and particularly Jokki teachings.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 All those seven treasures.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 And there's so many, Arsu, Korsham, Grandre, Korsham,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 and Mosel, Korsham, one after another, really all that.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 And somehow, most of those teachings are preserved now.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 We still have that, particularly because it's so explaining,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 exploring the heart meaning of the Jokki teaching.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 So many great practitioners, Jokki practitioners,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 kept that dearly to their heart.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 And the practice meditated.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 Therefore, these teachings are very valuable.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 So it's very famous, so famous.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 And now there's Maharanbhujis.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Many great master, I said earlier, read the books.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Also, he is really standing with these three, two great masters,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Ronganbha and Nongchimpa, and Jangmu Moham, Maharanbhujis.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 And many of you know the Maharanbhujis.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 I don't really, I mean, you know already that.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 But he was born in the 19th century, in the mid-19th centuries.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 And he was just a born, normal person.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 I think I recognize highly this and that in it,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 where we do all those so many things.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 But he's just a simple person, born in simple family in Eastern Tibet.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 But he's very smart, distinguished, and very virtuous.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Even in his very young time, time is so kind and compassionate

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 and concerning, caring thoughts like that.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 And everyone thought he's something beautiful.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 And then he received some teachings, but he immediately understand everything.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 Around the age of six or seven, he joined in the local monasteries of the new mass,

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 as regular monks, nothing, anything.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 And he received this meditation, but he understood it so easily.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 So everybody said, well, he's a very, very brilliant voice.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 Everybody said he understood.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 And around the age of 17, I think he went to Pelagram again in Central Tibet.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 And he went to the Middle States.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 And particularly in the Southern Tibet,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
 there is a very holy place called the Thobran Karchar.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 Thobran Karchar, in that area, when he came to that area,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 that moment in the life story, his conception is completely kind of lost.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 The mundane conceptions are lost.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 Completely kind of like different experience, realization.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 Don't, from his heart.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 And that's been so long time.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 So many, many days.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 That means many days, not long, long, many years.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 But still that.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 And then he come back to the Eastern Tibet.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 He received more teachings.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 And he practiced the meditation.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 He really got all the realization, exactly mentioned in the teaching.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 So he practiced the meditation.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 And but regularly, when he was young, around that early 20s,

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 he met his root teacher, the principal root teacher, who was,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 who was then the first great chintze.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 And a great chintze is one of the great master's in Buddhist history,

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 or the Tibetan Buddhism. So knowledgeable. So understanding everything.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 Everything on the Buddha teaching yet is so respectful.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 So respectful. All the schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 He made his journey to receive those teachings by his own, his own pit.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 And went to different places and received the teachings.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000
 The practice of meditation. So they become the holder of all the Buddhist teaching in Tibet.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 He is the founder, or co-founder of the Rimi movement.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 Modern time, or they call it Rimi.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 Truly, he is the founder, or co-founder of the Rimi movement of the practices,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 along with the great Yangmukundra.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 They both are really become so famous.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
 So this great master became his root teacher.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 Mahan Ramaji's root teacher. And he received all the teachings from the great post-chintze,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
 the great post-chintze, and the practice of meditation.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 And then he got highest realizations.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
 And also post-chintze, great chintze, encouraged to Mahan Ramaji.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
 Now you should write the books, teaching that will explain clarity

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
 and teaching of the Numa schools.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 So you should help write the books.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
 And as his encouragement, and as well as others, he wrote about 32 books.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 And now it is on the wood block wall and things.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 And all those, in that goal, they range from the Buddha's first teaching

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 all the way to the Dukki teaching.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 And he was one of the great masters.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 And then he also never stayed in this big monastery all the time.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 He stayed always in hermitage and practiced the meditation.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 He's just a simple monk, monk and a simple practitioner.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
 And he stayed in caves and hermitage, one after another.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
 Even though he was respected by so many, like in the early, like in the thirties and forties,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 everybody see this, his knowledge, realization, the extraordinary call.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 He was so honored that, but yet he chose the humble and the simple

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 as the great teacher, Buddha Hekamuni did, really.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
 Even Buddha become the Buddha.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 Buddha is humble and simple and joined with all the monks and the nuns

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
 and go to the with lunch with them and they're coming by that same way.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 Buddha released that.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
 So this great master did.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 And this is his teachings.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
 His teaching, one of them is teaching.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
 So I just choose this again.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 So this is the great master.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
 And then he entered Mahaparin nirvana around 1912-11.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 Mahaparin nirvana.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
 And that is a brilliant historian of these teachings, of these great masters.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 And so now we go to this text.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 I'm sure you all have this.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 I'm going to this text now.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 And this is the, this of course, according to teaching in the Tibetan Buddhism,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 when you go to teachings, they always kind of divided this,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 trying to highlight all these topics, one after another.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 And that will make a little bit easy understanding of the practitioners

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 or the one who is trying to learn.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 So they just always do that.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 And I will do that just a simple way to do this.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 This teaching is divided into three sections.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
 First is a title.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 Second is the principle of the teachings.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 And the third is the colophonous.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 Those are the simple ones.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
 First is the title.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 Title is with Buddhism, and there's always in teaching mentioned,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
 title has teaching, title is named after Buddha teaching.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 For example, Buddha teaching, named after the place.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 That teaching is named where that teaching came, taught,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
 named after the places.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 And sometimes teaching is named after one whole recursion of that teaching.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 So named after that individual's names.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
 And sometimes teaching named after the meaning of the teaching, sorry,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 meaning of the teachings.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
 And sometimes named teaching with examples, some examples.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 But this right teaching is named after the meaning of this text.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 So this teaching, this title is really the essential meaning

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 of the entire of these teachings.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 Teaching, teaching.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
 And that which is this also is help,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
 I able to translate this by the assistance of the,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 or not just the assistance, I asked to translate this to

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
 Peter, Pema Tarje or Peter De Niro.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
 De Niro, he translated, helped me translate this.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 So he's already translated.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
 And now in that, his translation is here, see it.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 In Tibet, it is called.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:55.000
 That's the Tibet translation.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 And English translated as essential advice

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 on the key point of the nature of the mind,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 which bestows the awakening to your hands.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
 So that is the title, title of that.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 And now we go over, what's the word called?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000
 We tried to, C-H-E-W.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
 He tried to chew this title.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 So what the use comes from this, that we try to do that.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 So we try to chew this.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 The pose is, pose where you understand already translated.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
 So this, but now I'm saying, we try to chew.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
 So the chewing is, this explaining,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 this explaining the foundation, part,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
 and the result of the practices.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 Foundation, part, and result.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 So what is foundation, which I explain here.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 If we translate it, if it's a word in Tibet, then easy.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
 But here, if we say the foundation is,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 key point of nature of the mind is a foundation.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
 Foundation.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 And then part is essential advice.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 And then when you follow that essential part,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 essential, when you follow that path,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 or essential advice, then what is brain?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
 The result, a waking mind, a waking mind.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 A waking, not mind.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
 A waking, is brain is a waking.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
 In Tibet it's called sanjir.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
 Sanjir means Buddha.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 And then how it brings, when it brings, right now.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 Right now I handed it to you.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
 It's your hand.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 So it's fast.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 It's fast delivery.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 It is like more fast than the paddocks.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 Faster, yeah, it's really, that's it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 So this is what is explaining.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 So pose is grown, I said grown.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
 I'm sure you heard so many times in the teaching.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 If you go to the very teachings,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 always they talk those things.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
 So it's not just a new term.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 Grown means what?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 The foundations.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 Foundation means what?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 The what is best.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 Best of what?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
 Best of samsara, best of nirvana.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 Because samsara and nirvana, of course,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
 samsara is a nirvana maybe you don't see now.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 But samsara is here.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 What is really best of samsara?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 In Buddhism, you know,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 they don't believe the cradles outside.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
 They don't believe that.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 So samsara is then best on what?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
 This samsara is here.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
 All this.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 Samsara is according to Buddhism

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 or according to Pramdha Mahayana,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
 all the way to Dokchin.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
 It's best on the mind.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 Samsara is best on the mind.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 That means what?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 Just only samsara.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
 What about nirvana?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
 Yes, nirvana is best on the mind.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 Not just the samsara and nirvana.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 Part to the nirvana is best on the mind.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 Mind is everything.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 Whose mind?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 Our mind.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
 My mind.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 My samsara is best on my mind.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 My nirvana is the best on my mind.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
 And your samsara is best on your mind.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
 Your nirvana is best on your mind.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 It's all in the best mind.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 For that reason,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
 great teacher Bodhakshaktamuni said,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 This three realms is nothing but mind.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000
 Three realms is nothing but mind.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 What three realms?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
 In Buddhism, desire realms,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
 poem realms, and poem-less realms.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 Those are called three realms.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 It's all samsara.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
 Desire realms include hill realms,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
 hungry ghost realms,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 animal realms,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 human realms,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
 asara realms, part of the god's realms,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 is all known as desire realms.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Why is it named as a desire realm?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
 This desire realm is so much attached

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
 with the personal contract

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 to the other individuals.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 True attachment.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 That is a desire realm.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 Every species,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
 everything is very much desired

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 because I like that called desire realms.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000
 Poem realms are mostly born

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
 according to teaching,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
 take the miracle as a birth

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 or incident as birth.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
 Immediately they take the birth.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
 Poem realms.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 And they have the perfect features,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 perfect feature and perfect beautiful body.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Therefore, it is named as poem realms.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 Poem-less realm has no poems.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
 It's all mental forms,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 no gross forms or mental.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
 That is mental forms.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 Doesn't matter what poem you have,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
 what kind of desire you have,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
 it's all samsara.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 Samsara is produced

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 by the karma and emotions.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
 Samsara is produced.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 And who creates the karma?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 By mind.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 Who created the emotions? By mind.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
 So, ultimately, it's mind.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
 Even though they externally see something,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 different things, this and that.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
 This, but it's all mind.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
 For that reason,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 the greatest teacher said in that sutta,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
 in this,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
 subjeba said in that ten bhumi sutta.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 Subjeba is a Tibetan word

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
 and ten bhumi, I'm translating,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 that in that English.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
 Thiriram is nothing but samsara.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 So, nothing but is mind.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
 Mind only.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
 Mind only is all.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
 So, that.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 This is not just only the sutra Mahayana teaching.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 Mind only.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 I mean, you heard also in Buddhism,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
 there is poor schools, doctrine schools.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 And bhiva shaka, sutta shaka schools,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
 post too, bhiva shaka and sutta shaka.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 And the third one is mind only school.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 And the fourth one is madema schools.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
 Mind only school is also Mahayana.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 Mahayana is all the way to the dokkim.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 It's all then same. It's all mind.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
 Mind just created that.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 Everything, really created it.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
 So, that.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
 Why post too?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 That.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
 They have a different understanding.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 Post too is explaining,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
 explaining this all caused by the atoms.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 Sutta ntaka and bhiva shaka school,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
 this came,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
 the root of the samsara

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 is cause of the atoms or particles,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
 combination of the particles.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 They develop these things.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
 So, they don't go further because that's what Buddha taught.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 Taught.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 Gradually Buddha lead.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
 In Mahayana, then Buddha break through.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
 Then is mind.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 That.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 So, from that school is all mind.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 And then there is numerous teachings.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
 And of course, in this teaching,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
 we are also explaining all is mind.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 Mind.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 And that is then our mind.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 And for the example in the great master,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 Nagarjuna said,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
 said,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 one you don't recognize,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
 one you don't recognize,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
 you are wondering in the samsaras.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 When you recognize that,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 you are free from samsara.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 That's what great master Nagarjuna said.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 So, then that is same thing in the dukkim prayer that we chant.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
 Very famous dukkim prayer that we often chant.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
 By the power of the knowing and unknowing,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 samsara, nirvana are went different way.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 And the ordinary is the same.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 One in that teaching said that we chant often.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 And one source to part and to result.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 One source is one best.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
 There is no different best for the samsara.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
 There is no different best for the nirvana.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 It's the same best.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 That is mind.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
 According to the teaching and the dukkim teaching, explaining.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
 That's simple.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
 And then, that nature here said,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
 essential point.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 That essential point is

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 that the Buddha nature is essential.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 Essential net

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 is the Buddha nature

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 that which we don't see now

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 due to our again dualities.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
 What great master Nagarjuna said.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
 Under the deep of the earth, there is clean water.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 Clean water.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
 But we don't see.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 Clean water, pure clean water.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
 Perfect clean water.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
 But under the deep of these negative emotions,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 we don't see the purity of this.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
 Our beauty.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
 Now our beauty, this is essential.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
 Of course, it's explaining more in the teachings later.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
 So that is essential.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
 How now to discover that essential?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000
 That is then

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 the essential advice.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 Then that is the advice translated in English.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
 In English, it is called shardam.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 Shardam means oral instructions.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 That also indicated.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
 This instruction is not just made up by recently.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 It's oral.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 It came from Buddha, great teacher from Buddha.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 Then all those master's.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
 It's a continuation.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
 Many times in a new school, they used to say

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
 the stainless golden chain.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
 Staleless golden chain.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 Why they use that golden chain?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
 Because everyone has perfect motivations.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 Joy, respect, and appreciation.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
 Courage and commitment.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 And diligence, really.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 And keeping preserving the lineage of teaching.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
 Not diluting these and that things.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 Those are called diluted lineage.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
 Diluted.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
 But teaching of the newman schools

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 or all the Buddhist schools is the stainless.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
 Really continuation.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 And when you preserve that to your heart,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 keep that up.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 Then it is eliminated.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 It brings up the light.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
 Light of love.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 Light of compassion.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
 Light of the humble and light of the humiliation.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
 Don't the earth.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
 Not hovering.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
 Hovering.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 And adding different things, this and that,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 all these things.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
 It's diluted.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
 It won't go any further, further.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 Even though it is a little bit counter-life.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
 Satisfying for the short time for the intellectual tolls.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 But reality is not going to break further down.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 Results.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
 When you follow with the lineage,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
 instructions, with the joy and the devotion,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 with the courage and the commitment,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 being loyalty to the teachings and practices.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
 The true beauty, true result, true accomplishment.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 Really welcome.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
 Without any doubt and hesitations.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:17.000
 This ordered advice also means in the newman Buddhism.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
 You all know that there's three lineages.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
 Mind to the mind transmission lineage

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 and symbolic transmission lineage.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
 This and ordered transmission lineage.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 Those two are concluded in the third lineage.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
 Blessings of the mind to mind transmission lineage

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 and symbolic transmission lineage

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
 all include the ordered transmission lineage.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 This.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 And what is ordered transmission lineage?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 Order instructions.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 Order instructions or advice on the view.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
 V-E-I-W.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 Instructions on the view.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 Instructions on the meditation.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
 Instructions on the or advice on the conduct.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
 Those follows one after another.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
 All connected.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
 Meditation is connected to the view or best on the view.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 Conduct is the best on the view and the meditation.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
 Follows that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
 What is the view explaining,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
 going to explain in this teaching so many times.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
 I won't talk.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
 And what is meditation?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 Meditation in the Dzogki teaching is rather true

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
 and is not of toga.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 Toga meditation and toga meditation.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 This teaching is more emphasizing on the toga meditation.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 Conduct means how you keep up the practices,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 lineage teaching or this lineage teaching.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 That is the conduct.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 Conduct is so important in the teaching set.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 And all the great masters said,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
 conduct will boost our realizations.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
 And we don't keep the conduct.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 It will jeopardize the realization and achievements.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 Conduct.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 There is many conduct in the Dzogki teaching.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 Optimization.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
 Those are known as the port for conduct.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:47.000
 And Dzogki in the meditation says,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
 true conduct.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 Dzogki means thoughtful or head-pullness,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
 or consciousness.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Conduct of consciousness or head-pullness.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
 Second conduct is toga yoga,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 which is a Tibetan word.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 And I saw the many translators,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
 those famous translators of this time,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
 the English translators,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 the translators of yogic conduct.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
 Second is yogic conduct.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
 Yogic, yogic conduct, conduct.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
 But among these two,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
 or that if we divided that more,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 more in the Buddha teaching set,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 there is five conduct.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
 The all native beginner conduct,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 yogic conduct, great yogic conduct,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
 and Mahasiddha conductors and Buddha conductors.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
 Those are the five conductors.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 Five conductors.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
 So the first one,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
 beginner practitioner or the general conductor,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 is then the conductor of the consciousness,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 or conductor of head-pull, head-pull, right?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 H-E-E-D.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 H-E-E-D.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
 Heating, yeah, heating.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
 I thought I saw the heating conduct.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
 Heatfulness, heatfulness.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
 So these are the five conductors.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 The first conduct is for the beginner practicum.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 Every practicum is so important

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000
 to keep the basic good conduct with mindfulness.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
 For example, all the united teachings,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 it has for teaching.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
 Heatful or consciousness teaching.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 Teaching, all the conduct.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
 That is, as I say, simple ritual,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 is conduct of the mindfulness,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 is conduct of the tempo,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
 and thoughtful, and it's conduct of the consciousness.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 That is all that.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
 So this.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
 And then what did the teaching say?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
 Teacher.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 First, for example, this conductor,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 first practitioner,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
 or first beginner practitioner,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 should not act as a conductor of the yogi,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
 nor should not act as a conductor of the great yogi,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 and nor should act as a conductor of the mastidas.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
 And of course, don't mention Buddhas.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
 Buddhas.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 So don't.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 The better to save heaven.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
 Stay on the ground.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
 And grow up slowly.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 Even if you have the highest realization and achievement,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
 still be as great master Mahore Ramaji as we can.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 Be as a great master Jangwoo Kuntra.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
 Be as a great master,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
 a great person chancing,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
 or popular Ramaji.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
 Really, that's it.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 We should act as,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 like only people are kind of trying to act

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
 as the conductor of the yogic conductor,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
 or as well Mahore said the conductor is that.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
 Then we fall apart.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 And in the Tibetan village, you're saying,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
 don't imitate a tiger and try to jump.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 Emitate a tiger or a cheetah.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
 Where a cheetah, a cheetah, and a tiger jump,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
 and we're trying to jump.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
 You're that way.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
 And we can break our back.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
 Back spins.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
 Then we're heading to the,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
 what's called this name?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
 911.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 So, what does that say?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
 So I don't know if we can.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
 And then it's so much communication.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 So better to stay in the same,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
 and let grow beautifully,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 and beautify that way.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
 So that is the IQ,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 trying to cue the two world,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
 three world stay here.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 I live here today, okay?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
 Everyone who participate, okay?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
 Thank you.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
 Thank you, thank you.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 Thank you for coming.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
 Again, thank you for participating.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
 We do, again, free meditation,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 and then we do this dedication

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
 already in this booklet.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 So we just follow with this dedication, please.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
 Thank you, everyone.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
 (Applause)

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
 (Applause)

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
 Okay, and page, page 25,

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 according to this.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
 What?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 Oh, 24.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
 I'm sorry, sorry.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
 I'm sorry.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
 23, 23.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
 Page 31.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:18.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
 Thank you.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
 Thank you.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
 Thank you.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 Thank you.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 Thank you.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
 Thank you.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
 Thank you.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
 Then see you on Monday.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
 See you on Monday.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
 See you on Monday, and tomorrow we won't have the Zoom

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 because I'm going to do the empowerment of the --

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
 of the great wisdom of the Indonesian soldiers.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
 So kind of -- I feel so hesitant to do that on the Zoom.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
 And plus, even the teaching itself, really,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 also I can't feel that, but there's a technology,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
 and so many people were already practicing this.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 And one point, a great master, his whole journey said,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
 said everyone is so kind of participating.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 I mean, they are all interested.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
 And then also in a great, famous sutta called samajiraji sutta,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 in that teaching said there was no one is incapable

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
 because everyone has Buddha nature.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 Nature said that.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
 So therefore, in that context, of course, as I said,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
 we cannot follow, kind of do the imitator

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 as his own [inaudible]

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
 or other great masters.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
 But at least they said, and you all read the books

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
 and know that more than me.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 So I thought maybe it's okay trying to do this through the Zoom.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
 The teaching itself, the empowerment is more kind of connected

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
 with ritual and all that.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 And so then they're kind of always hesitant,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
 so that we won't do that tomorrow.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
 And then we'll see you again on Monday.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
 And thank you very much again to participate, everyone.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 Okay. Thank you.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
 Thank you.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
 Thank you.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
 Thank you.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 Thank you.
