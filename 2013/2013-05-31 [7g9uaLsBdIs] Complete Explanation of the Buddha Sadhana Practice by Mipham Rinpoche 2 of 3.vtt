00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.000

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.150
 This is the third of the three videos covering the complete teaching on the Buddha Shakya Muni Wind

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.000
horse Retreat.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Even the cops, they are so hungry, so fast, there is nothing left.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And he gives up his own life to save this hungry tiger, and the tigerous, and the cops.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 That's the one beautiful story that the Buddha gave up, his own life to free the tigerous.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And there are so many beautiful stories, one after another.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.100
 There are so many that the Buddha gave, how completely activated that he performed through that, he

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.000
 became the Buddha.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.250
 But the one after another, through his generous, through his willingness, through his courage and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.000
 commitment.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.740
 And there is another beautiful story, again, is that the teaching said that one time Buddha was

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.000
 born as a turtle, sea turtle.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 I mentioned that one time, I mean, so many, but he was born as sea turtle, sea turtle.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 In the ocean, there is also martians going in the ocean.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.940
 I wrote martians in the ocean and said, "I want big sheeps, sheeps, suddenly big or I can tell what

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.000
 type you came, and it's completely upside down."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And then all those martians, those beings are holding whatever they can hold to save their lives,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 lives.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 But this is not really going so far.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 At that time, Buddha was as born as I said, sea turtles.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And again, he came on the shore to save them.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 He indicated they can hold him.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And as he did, and all those martians are whole, travels born to the sea turtles.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And Buddha drove them to the shore with big apple.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 He brought all of them on the shore.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.020
 Once he go to the shore in the teaching, he said he was so tired, so tired, he fall asleep on the

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.000
 shore.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Then he woke up.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 The moment he woke up, he woke up because so many insects are biting him, biting him.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 And because of that pain, he woke up.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 And he thought, suddenly going to jump to the ocean, talk.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And then he thought, oh, I came here to save these human beings.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And now if I jump back, this all will die.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 So what does that mean?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 This is the time I'm going to give my life.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Even they eat bone, and I'm going to eat.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And through this effort, through this quality of commitment, I did become the Buddha.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 May I share my first teaching to these beings?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Because he made that beautiful statement.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 He said, and the teaching said he passed away because of everyone.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So this is again one of the beautiful stories, how kind and competitive.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Even he was born as animals.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 He continued to keep his commitment and courage.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Same thing, and then he became the Buddha.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 So therefore, here, the great compassion one, great teaching, I propose.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And how many is there?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Again, respect and appreciation is very opposite of the arrogance.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 When you don't have the arrogance, arrogance is one of the most negative emotions, obstacles to us.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Like all, money, I mean not all, but many mistakes don't bite our arrogance.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 There's gross arrogance, medium arrogance, very subtle arrogance.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.960
 And this arrogance, generally, as soon as we have the ego clinging, there is some degree of the

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.000
 arrogance.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 We act that knowingly, unknowingly, and that becomes disturbance for our joy and peace,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 our own and joy and peace for others.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Therefore, arrogance is one of the negative emotions.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 During the respect and appreciation is very underdog of the arrogance.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And so that with the understanding, with respect and appreciation.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And then there is the offerings.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Offering the second group, again, is the way to accumulate the merit, so offerings.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And this is, again, generally, offering me this practice of generosity.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 There's many, as in teaching, so now maybe I won't go to that community.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 We all know this basically.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Accumulator of the merit of the three dolls by the wealth of my seven fathers.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And this is three dolls.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Accumulator of the merit means somebody don't bite a good heart.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Good heart.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And that is, as we elaborated that good heart, is by true love, true compassion, devotion, joy.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Whatever we did something with that divine thought and start that with it,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 reflect that we wobble and ache, whatever we do, it is merit.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Why is old merit?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Because it matters.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 You have it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Where it started is habit.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 True love is habit.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 True compassion is habit.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Devotion is habit.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Joy is habit.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 With that, we do some activity.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Also, it will make same thing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Others are not happy.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Others make peaceful.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 It makes beautiful environment.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Therefore, it is known as "meh" is a good deal.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And so good did whatever we did by our three dolls.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 This is a metaphor in Buddhism.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 They use three dolls.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 That means body, speech, or body, verbal, and our mind.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 That is what we get.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And why they put dolls in the teacher always?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 These three are the entrance of our every deed.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Then through this entrance, it performs every hour deeds.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Whether it is negative, whether it is positive, whether it is neutral,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 every human went through these three dolls, three entrance.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Went through mind, through verbal, through physical.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 They are like an entrance of dolls.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Dolls, for that reason, is a music metaphor.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Here he discusses the good deeds.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Good deeds that whatever I did, did,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 and then together with our good deeds and my wealth.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 That my wealth and this time I have.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 All that wealth.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Well, and not just my wealth, but also wealth of every dimension.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 So that means physically existing our wealth and together with it mentally.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Mentally anything that you see, beautiful things, good things in this universe,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 or not just the whole universe of all, that what we see now.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And then in the teaching always also said, even if we don't have now,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 but in the past, in the past our lives, we have many a wealth too.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 In life, those all we bring back to now,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 and in the future lives, whatever we have wealth and others will have wealth.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 We bring that to now here, to the person,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 and make that as one big offering, things, and as in the teachings.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 When you write them as offering the clothes,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 it's magic with the smell of offerings, endless, infinite,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 and beautiful, exulting things that I've made that offering

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 to all the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, and all the enlightened beings,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 or to benefit all living beings.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So that is offerings.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 And offering is then, is opposite of, what's it called?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Mises, I will say.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 I will say it, and offering is also a generous practice.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 And then next is compassion.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Compassion is a pre-replication practice.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 It's called pre-replication.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Again, compassion means this, of course, terminology of the Buddha teachings,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 or the spiritual or world-use compassion.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 But compassion is tools and means to harmonize them,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 to cleanse them, and to purify them.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 This is what compassion is.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 That is called purification or compassion.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 We purify, we cleanse with that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Compassion means also we are acknowledging the deeds,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 something if not good, you acknowledge it yourself.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 I know, I did something wrong,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 and then I'm glad to clean, I like to purify.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 That is the one that we need compassion.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And this, of course, even though in the samsara world,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 even we didn't use the terminology or the religious terminology,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 in the samsara and mandic world, we do that.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 For example, we may say to each other, "I'm sorry."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 That sorry world is compassion.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 That we've used the world as religious.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Sorry world, you see.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 That means you acknowledge it.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Tools acknowledge it, something that mistakes,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 and that hurts feelings for others.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And therefore, you will say, "I'm sorry."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 When you say, or when people say, "Sorry,"

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 that cleans, that clears weight.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 That negative clears weight, it won't.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Others also don't hold that as negative.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 That energy, that evaporation is clearing.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And also, also, you become happy.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Why say that?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 That is cleansing.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 That is purifying.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Of course, it's all magic.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It's all a dream again.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 It's nothing solid, permanent.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Is it just a dream?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 It's a verb, it's verbal.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Verbal, but the verbal is magic verbal.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Magic verbal, and it means, as I said, we acknowledge it.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Something not right.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 And therefore, I say, "Sorry."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 I say, "Sorry."

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 "Sorry."

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 That is.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And here, sir, I needed that I did mistakes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Knowingly, unknowingly, and directly, indirectly,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 that hurt me, that hurt others,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I'm now going to cleanse and qualify.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 I'm not going to keep that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 With that experience, and trying to also keep an heart in mind,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 I'm never going to do again that.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 All the blessings of the Buddha and Bodhisattva,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 I won't do any mistakes.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 That will hurt others, hurt me.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 This is restricting our quality and commitment.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And also, it is purifying, because what we call,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 we practice.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Practice makes perfect.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 It also means that we do some mistakes.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 We're not perfect.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 But yet, we are trying to make perfect.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And this purification and compassion

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 is one of the special tools.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Tools to make ourselves perfect and beautiful.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 And then it won't stay in the mental states.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And so, with that understanding.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And this purification is also known directly,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 and this purification is directly

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 the antidote of ignorance.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 It's also ignorance.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 But when we do the negative activities,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 most of the time, we're not doing that with you.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 With knowing.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Many times, we do the mistakes.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Even we do with knowingly,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 we did that with emotions.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Emotions are rooted on the ignorance.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 The primary source of every negative activity

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 comes from the ignorance.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Therefore, in the Buddha teaching said,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 anger is the best condition,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 source of every negative activity that we do.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Therefore, it's an ignorance.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 And therefore, when we perfect this,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 this is the direct antidote of ignorance.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 So that is really a Buddha's compassion.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And next one is rejoicing.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Rejoicing, again, in the teaching said here,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 so I won't do too much,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 but it's rejoicing opposite,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 direct antidote of the jealousness.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Rejoicing.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 When we rejoice and joy,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 happiness and goodness for others,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 when we feel rejoiced that,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 it's also joy and rejoice.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 We don't get upset.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 We didn't get kind of feel bad.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 We didn't make comment on that.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 But feel happy and joyful.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Oh, how wonderful.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 How beautiful.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 May they have that forever.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Not just for them,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 but make every living have that beautiful success.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Beautiful things, beautiful times.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Really, which is sincerely from our heart.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 That is not rejoicing.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It is so powerful,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 so special in the Buddha teaching said.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Here we are, what the Buddha said.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 In the merit of the noble one of persons,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 all their events are culminated

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 throughout the three times, highly rejoiced.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Good deeds of the events,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 who are doing some of the good things in this world,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 something making really beautiful difference there.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Who wish that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 How wonderful.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 May they can do for that for a long time.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Even better that.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 May everyone can do that.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 May even I can.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 May I able to do that similar as they do that.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Wishing that sincerely and making that statement

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 from the heart.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 That is rejoicing.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 And then good deeds.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Anything good deeds.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Everything good deeds.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Whether they are enlightened beings doing good deeds,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 or whether ordinary beings are doing something good in this.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 In the name of religions,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 in the name of not only religions,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 a good deed is a good deed.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 We have to enjoy, appreciate, respect that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Wishing that sincerely how beautiful it is.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 In the teaching said,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 if you wish that even you didn't do your self-physical,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 but there's a wishing in self,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 you join with that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 You join with that,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 you will get also merit.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 You will gain merit.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Merit.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Even their performance,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 not their drawings,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 but simply our gesture,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 heartfelt joy,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 appreciation,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 what they did,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 exalt is great merit.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 We will get same result in the Buddha teaching said.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 We will get the same result.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Result, benefit.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 It's one of the spiritual way.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And then it is also known as

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 direct antidote of jealousness.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Jealous.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Jealous.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Jealous.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Jealous.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And also in teaching said,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 it will open our capabilities.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Couple of bullets of good deeds.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 You aspire.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Once you aspire in your heart

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 with that something good,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 that means you are opening that couple of bullets.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Your self.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So you can perform that.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Similar things even better.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Better.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Therefore,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 can close shut down with guilt

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 and kind of making comments on those things,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 then it's just pulling our self,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 making our self more weak,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 stronger and reduce our capabilities

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 instead of explaining that.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 That's what the teaching says.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 And so that's,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and then next one is,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 is then turning the wheel of dharma

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 as opposed to teaching.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Teaching, and this is already said,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 but this teaching is known as,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 as opposed to teaching is known as directly,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 then antidote also ignorance.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 It is for the Muslims.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 It's because we are asking,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 wisdom, so that is,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 this many varieties of the Buddha teachings,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 from the Mahayat in the Yarnam,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Pratihi Buddha in all the Mahayana teachings,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 all the Muslims.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Or any of the world of the Muslims.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Anywhere there,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 purpose have the capabilities,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 and they're not for whom.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 You're asking,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 that is then known as the coastal thing.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 It is then, again, direct antidote,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 ignorance.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It is wisdom, all the Muslims.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And then,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 the prayer to remain.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Prayer to remain.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Remain, again, this is,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 and this is then, again,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 prayer to remain is directly,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 again, antidote of the teaching,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 anger and jealousness.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So that whoever is doing,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 performing the novel activities in this world,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 or anything,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 that they will pray,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 they may have,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 they all have long lives,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 long living,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 and continue doing good activities.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 And the same time,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 every single living being

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 has a long life,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 and hope for joy,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 and happy, healthy lives.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 So this is very special practices,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 and this is the real antidote of the giros,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 and as well as angers.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Angers,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 and that is already here.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 So then,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 whether you may appear in this,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 or be in this world always,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 that's what is in the teaching setting.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And the next one is the dedicating prayers.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Dedicating prayer is then,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 dedicating marriage.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Marriage,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 to, again, our deed,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 as exactly as we say,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 it is,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 dedicating is,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 again,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 directly antidote of attachment,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 and as well as miser.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Miser.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And it is also,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 directly antidote to the ego claims,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 like that.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 So in the teaching setting.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 So therefore,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 dedicating,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 very special,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 is the one,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 again,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 extra only in the teaching of the Buddha Chaturmani,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 that our good deeds,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 married,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 and in what we have,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 we are going to share that to every living being,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 with them,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 to all beings,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 God that,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 by that,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 when they are suffering,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 difficult,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 is one of the very special tools of,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 again,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 but by compassion activities.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 So we are going to do this for all living beings,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 not just only for some small gurus,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 but every living,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 whatever I did,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 whatever I do,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 meditate,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 practice,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 go even smoke,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 good deeds,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 whatever I do,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 may this become the benefit for all living beings,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 beings to everyone,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 everyone.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So we heed that,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 and sincerely,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 God is called,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Dedication Praise.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 And that also,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Dedication Praise,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 is convoluted,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 the practice will be born into the truth.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 So it's both ways.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 And next one is the emocation.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Yes, the emocation,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 this is generally,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 means the Buddha,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 you are the enlightened beings,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 whatever that I have not,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 I understand realization,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 that through the teaching of the Buddha,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 is your enlightenment activities.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Your things,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 if you didn't come to this world,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 there will not be such a great teaching of love and comfort.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 First of all,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 I don't have that understanding,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 have that clear understanding.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Therefore,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 whatever knowledge,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 the realization that I got from the Buddha teaching,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 is your activities,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 whether it come from Guru Pia Masambha,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 whether it come from all,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 any God of great masters of the schools,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 of the Buddhism,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Buddhism,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 fundamentally go back to the Buddha,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 you,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 you are the soul of everything,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 that's what I say.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Therefore,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 I understand how you are so spiritual,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 how so important,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 and please be continually,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 keep me in your compassion,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 I,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 and hold me with your hand,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 and always guide me through your compassion activities,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 so that I become,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 exactly same as the you,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 so I can benefit all living beings,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 as you are doing that,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 and please make that be that.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 So that is the emocation.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 It is sincerity,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 courage,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 confidence,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 trusting,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 competent,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 and devotion,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 and that you are,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 like to make that,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 with determination.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So that is the statement.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Statement,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 and with those all praise,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 in the,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 in the context of the seven brain,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 accumulation practices,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 and then,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 with strong presence of Buddha,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 and we guide this praise,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 praise,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 and we guide these mantras.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 And these mantras are,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 of course,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 the mantras of the Buddha Kherkamuni,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 but Buddha Kherkamuni teaching says,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 this is a mantra,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 not just the Buddha Kherkamuni himself,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 but it is the Buddha's,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 of all the potent Buddha's mantras,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 and all this so spiritual mantra,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 mantra that Buddha Kherkamuni himself

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 become,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 by also one of the principles,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 these powers,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 these mantras,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 is teachings,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 teachings,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 and as well as them,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 and also great,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 J.S.,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 our Lord Kherkamuni also become great

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 companion,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 emanation in one,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 according to one teaching,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 because of these mantras.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 This mantra is so special,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 and with this understanding,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 residing in these mantras.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And then,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 the world,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 the world meaning of the mantra is then,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 the other is das,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 I think, das,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 according to this das,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 and then the om is the aspicuous prosperity,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 aspicuous prosperity,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 and goodness,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 good fortune,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 and harmony,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and those are the meaning of the om.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Meaning of the om syllables,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 according to the Sanskrit language.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And then,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 muni,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 muni,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 mahamana,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 here is soa,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 so those are the mantras.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Muni is one,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 there is a second muni,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 there is mahamana.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And the world meaning of muni means,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 mighty one,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 mighty one,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 great mighty one,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 and then,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 soa,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 all muni can be,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 it is translated as tupa,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 that I'm translating mighty,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 or it can be sujure,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 sujure,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 sujure,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 great sujure,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 that established.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Soa is established.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And what that means,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 the great master,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 K.I. Bhaddishwara Muni mentioned,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 this is muni,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 it has many meanings.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 One may,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 it's called in the negative emotions,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 where is arises.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 There is three principle negative emotions.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Those are known as three bosons,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 three bosons.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 And those are those,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 that many of you know already.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Those are,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 we go to the first,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 as anger.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Second is attachment.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Third is ignorance,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 ignorance.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So the first muni means,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 means you sujure the anger.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Second muni, you subdue the attachment.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Third, mahamuni,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 the great subjure.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 You subdue the ignorance.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Ignorance comes from,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 attachment and anger comes from ignorance.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Anger is,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 I call it the ignorance level,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 anger is more on the surface.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Surface is more stronger,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 but yet it's a little more light.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 It's not light.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 So anger actually comes from attachment.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Attachment comes from ignorance.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 So anger,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 attachment is stronger or deeper than anger.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Anger, so there of course is,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 anger removed.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Attachment removed.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And then,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 all sorts of emotions, ignorance.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Ignorant removed.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 All the subdued, subdued, you subdued.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And then another way, again,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 can you be all alone, know that, know this,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 through the way we act,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 the activity of the body,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 negative activity of the body,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 negative activity of the verbal,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 negative activity of the mind.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 So forced muni means,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 the mighty one who subdue

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 the negative activity of the body,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 mighty one who subdue the negative activity of the speech,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 the great mighty one who subdue

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 the negative activity of the mind.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 The negative, all negative activity comes from the mind,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 whether it's verbal, whether it's physical.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 So fundamentally, it is the mind that you subdue.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 So therefore, then when you subdue that,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 what it becomes?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 What it becomes?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Anger becomes the wisdom of true loving kindness

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 and a loving kindness.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So the attachment becomes

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 great loving kindness and compassion.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And then anger becomes the great wisdom stress.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And when you subdue all the wide activities

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 of the body, speech, mind, what it will become?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Then body becomes so gentle and so peaceful.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And speech becomes so gentle and so peaceful.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Mind becomes, when the mind's negative and subdue,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 becomes so gentle and so peaceful.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 That was called, then,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 the gentle, peaceful, bliss.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 That is what comes.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So by practice of this,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 with that understanding, with that meaning,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and the recital this month,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 they had their own muni, muni, mahamana.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 They called them muni teaching, and they said,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 so you can jai it as many as time,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 they had their own muni, muni, mahamana, and so on.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And then sometimes, if you don't want,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 they are in the teaching, say, also you can jai from

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 own muni, muni, mahamana, and so on.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So in either way, the KG body generally uses jai

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 in everything.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 He jai in everything, every time.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 All the time, not really kind of making

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 different tayat, that means tayat or muni, muni, mahamana.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 That's why he always jai tayat or muni, muni, mahamana, and so on.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 And then some other great teachers jai,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 jai that or muni, muni, mahamana, and so on.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Don't say.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 And then afterward, or muni, muni, mahamana, and so on.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 So I think either way is fine.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And the teaching said too.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 So either way, so then they decided.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 During that time, during that time,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 then in the Buddha's bodhisattva eminence,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 so many golden lights to you, to all the victims,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 and removing our suffering from the difficult troubles

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and ignorance, and removing our Buddha nature

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 completely, purely perfectly.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 And then it was all the same.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 We're thinking that with full devotion,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 with full competence, competence without intellectual

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 aid, analyzation, and skeptical thought, practice.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 That is what required practices with that practice.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 For yoga, yoga, bodhicata, mandar, the blended, all that,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 all that, when you meditate practice,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 they really throw all our system, the body,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 going the great healing, rejuvenating, natural.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 They're going everywhere.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Love and compassion, wisdom, joy, appreciation,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 is going everywhere, all such stuff.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Our body has become the body of love, compassion,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 joy, and devote.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Our energy becomes that.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Our system becomes that.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Our breathing becomes that.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 And our continuity serves.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 And the blood becomes in that womb, the beautiful status.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 This is the great healing practices,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 great powerful practices.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 And then what indeed?
