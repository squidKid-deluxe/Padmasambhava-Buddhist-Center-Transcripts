NOTE     "synopsis": "New Buddha Statues Arrive to PSL in Upstate New York!\nby Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nOctober 29, 2019\n\nA 20 foot Enlightenment Stupa will be placed in the center, surrounded by the following 12 foot stupas in the four directions: a Heaped Lotuses Stupa, a Many Doors Stupa; a Complete Victory Stupa; and a Mahaparinirvana Stupa.\n\nThese five stupas honor and commemorate Buddha Shakyamuni\u2019s birth, enlightenment, teaching the Dharma, extending his life, and mahaparinirvana.\n\nThe five stupas are made of solid volcanic rock, and were hand-carved in Indonesia by an expert craftsman. In addition, a small temple is being built in to honor and house a life-sized statue of \"Looks Like Me\" Guru Padmasambhava!\n\nIf you would like to support this glorious, meritorious project in honor of our lineage masters, or a loved one, please mail a check payable to \u201cPBC\u201d to Padma Samye Ling monastery, and note in the memo who the donation is being made on behalf of.\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org/psl-meadow-stupa-garden\n\nThe benefits of building stupas were spoken of by the buddha in the Noble Amazing Sutra:\n\nAnanda! Any devoted noble sons and  daughters who fill this entire three-thousand-fold universe with the  seven precious metals and make offerings to all the stream-enterers,  once-returners, non-returners, and arhats\u2014as well as all the sangha  members in the four directions\u2014do not accumulate as much merit as  someone who makes a stupa to the Tathagata\u2014the Subduer, the Perfectly  Enlightened One, the One Who Entered Mahaparinirvana\u2014 that is even the  size of a churura seed, with a central column the size of a needle, an  umbrella the size of a juniper leaf, and filled with grain-sized statues  and mustard seed-sized relics.\n\nMoreover, in the Analyzing Activity Sutra, the Buddha said to the brahmin son Netso:\n\nWhoever builds the Stupa of the  Tathagata will gain the eighteen benefits. These are: (1) to be born in a  royal family, (2) with perfect features (3) and a beautiful body; (4)  who everybody loves to see (5) and looks to as a leader; (6) with fame  expanding in the ten directions, (7) beautiful cheering sounds, (8) and  praised with beautiful verses; (9) very detached from the world (10) and  honored by gods (11) and humans; (12) very wealthy, (13) with a long  life (14) and as healthy and strong as a vajra; (15) possessing the  major marks (16) and minor marks; (17) born in the upper realms; (18)  and soon to enter the supreme enlightened state.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org/the-importance-of-stupas",
