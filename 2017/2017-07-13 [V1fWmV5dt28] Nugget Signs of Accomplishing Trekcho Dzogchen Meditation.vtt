00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 Good, very good, big topic. Sign of the Trekcho meditation. That is then we're talking about the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 Trekcho. So, the Trekcho meditation, sign of the Trekcho meditation, for example, the nugget signs

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.000
 are

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.640
 more bodhijatas. Really, bodhijata arises so beautifully, so spacious. And your devotions

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.480
 are also so strong and so powerful and so warm. And your joy and appreciation is also very strong

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.160
 and beautiful and so kind of precious. And then also your attachment is really very soft, very

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:03.360
 much soft. And emotions are not really killing us, such as anger, yellows, arrogance, against not

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.560
 really killing us, as usually do. And even though even those can arise, they definitely can arise

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 for a long time, but also immediately recognizing that and not let that go far and immediately

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 liberating that, those thoughts. So, those all are really, in the particular and in the teachings,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.840
 of course, preposonants are very powerful. But among these two, two are, that is what, arrogance

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.440
 and the yellows. These arrogance and yellows are generally the combination of three poisons,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:53.680
 but they are so easy to come in our mind. Yellows is very easy. Many times we don't detect them,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.120
 yellows. And also arrogance is so easy to come in our heart and mind. We don't detect them. So,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.960
 really seek out those so clearly and let them come. Then really we are quite very good, very good.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.960
 And then our meditation, that means also our meditation on the tikkyu is a very good step.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.920
 That is really then excellent, excellent. But even if we didn't reach that status,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 that status, then we started practicing tikkyu in the tikkyu teaching, also within good foundation

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 of the, I mean, we start practicing tikkyu with a good foundation of tikkyu. In the teaching set,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 also really it will help to boost up the tikkyu realization too, because it's connected. It's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:51.520
 connected. So, it really boosts up as tikkyu realization by tikkyu practices. So, therefore,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.040
 I think that we can start the bursa of pukkles in the teaching set, those are really important

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.840
 and I'd generally, generally a struggle of the lineage, again, our hondra practice and rafukin

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 bodhijeta, those are really teaching set. And once you did those things, and then do also, if you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.400
 have time, this hondra practice, ah, it's hondra practice of tikkyu and toga practice, we do those

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.800
 also, eat with us as much as we can. And then I think maybe it's going to do started with the toga

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 Practice is awesome.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 Thank you very much.
