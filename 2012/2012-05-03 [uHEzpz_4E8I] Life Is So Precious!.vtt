00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 "Now, the first is the Four Renal Sessions. Regular terminology. The Four Renal Sessions

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 is as I said, and you know, nothing is a mystery, nothing is exaggerated or nothing is added

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.000
 with the Buddhist dogmas here. Whether we like to omit that or whether we don't like to omit

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.400
 that, that's what it is. That's it. That's what it is. Among the Four Renal Sessions,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 what is it? The great master's singing, fourth one, is the precious human body. The precious

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 of our life. Human body, in particular, our life. This our present life, you, me, is so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 precious, so special. That's what I also said the other day. The father said, have the joy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Joy is important. We have every reason to be joy. This beautiful life is with us. This

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 is beautiful. It's all the means of tools, as the great master said. Another master is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 welcome. It's bold. It is planned to cross the samsara to make the change, to make the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 difference. We know that this is. We're not going to achieve. We're not going to do it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And then, particularly, this is so special. This life is so special. And this is, again,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 very simple. As I said, this great master's teaching is so simple, so direct. It just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 goes to the target. Target is, as I said, his own realization is experienced as one

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 of the great teachers. It's also very colloquial, of course. You don't know that it's colloquial

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 but in Tibet, it's colloquial. It's very beautiful. Colloquial is very easy to understand.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And also simple. Now, here, that begins with what? It begins with the chima ho. Chima ho

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 is wonderful. How beautiful it is. It's wonderful. It's beautiful because it's going to give

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 the songs of the way things are without keeping in or hiding. And this great master is going

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 to sing the song without any fears. Fears, excited as it is. It's wonderful how beautiful

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 it is. It is the song of freedom, song of joy, song of appreciation, song of recognizing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 the values of the way things are. How beautiful it is. And each time, he highlights how precious,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 how beautiful. That is what I have. It's not just talking somebody's trail outside. It's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 not going through the cane story about trails. Oh, you have this and that things. He is saying

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 that to us we have that. You have that. You have that. How precious. How rich. Oh, he's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 saying himself. I have that. I have that. I have this. This. It's a wonderful one, not

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 another. So beautiful. And the first one is then, is that said, as I translated, there

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 are many eons, but they're rarely done history. So there's many eons. Eons is chain of the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 times in a way that we know. I mean, you know, the century, millenniums. Millennium is not

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 just stay forever. Centuries are changing or the days are changing, hours are changing,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 days are changing, month is changing, years are changing. Decade is changing. Centuries

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 are changing. And millenniums are changing. All millenniums are moving. It's moving, moving,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 moving. And the aeon is changing. Changing. And then even though they're all changing,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 they're not, that means they're not saying. It's not exactly the same. It's changing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Changing. Yesterday is not the same today. Today will not be the same tomorrow. It's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 just the way things are. Things. But this time is when it's changing. Changing. Even

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 there's so many changes. Therefore, the teaching in some eons or some centuries, some millenniums,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 there's no teachings at all. Buddha in the teaching said, Buddha never, Buddha came,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Buddha gone, Buddha didn't came, and their teachings are not there. Buddha came, Buddha

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 gave the teaching, teaching disappeared. That happened. That happened. But this time, this

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 beautiful golden portion of eons, among the portion of eons, the gracious teacher, Buddha

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Shakyamali came, he gave the teaching. Those great practical and the lineage borders are

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 pulled. Teachings are still shining as billions sun. Even there's many interruptions up another

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 that. But in our area, our place, there is a beautiful window of light. The sun is shining

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 brilliant brightly and warmly to us. How wonderful, how beautiful it is. How joyous it is. And

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 then this is one after another. I don't have to go this, this, so I won't go through more

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 things. But then there's many things, all these, like there are many, many buildings,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 but also Buddha won't come. And for example, in this portion of eons, there is also one

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 portion of Buddha came. And this portion of eons, and in this portion of the eons, there's

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 one portion of Buddha, and this is the fourth of Buddhas. And then even Buddha came, sometimes,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 as I said, more real, and then his terms and teachings are not there. Buddha came, teaching

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 this effort. So that is about the teachings. And now, next one is about our lives. Our

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 lives are very precious. My life is precious, your life is precious. It's also real. It's

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 real. That means it's real, real and precious. It's difficult to obtain such assets as what

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 we have these conditions. First that you know, the 18 endowments. Among the 18 endowments,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 first is called ad freedoms. We all have the ad freedom lectures. Ad freedom lectures.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 You have, I have. It is so special. If we look at these ad freedoms or other things,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 that can be, we can have maybe only seven freedoms. We can have only like ad freedoms.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It can happen, but it's not happen. That means our cause and the condition, our circumstances,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 everything went so balanced, exactly where we want. Everything went so beautiful, exactly

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 where we want. Time we consulted, time we kept the birth, time we grown up, even there

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 is, this and that things happen. But still, I am. Still you are what you are. So beautiful,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 so sweet. Anything can be interrupted. Even everything walked so well. Some kind of happened,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 happened and then changed the course. That we know. So that means everything really went

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 so well and so beautiful and it's so sweet. And then among the human beings, and then

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 we start talking about generally, and then among the, in the court of Buddha teaching,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 there is four continents, four continents. And first, there is four continents and that,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 among that, this, our continent is called the Southern continents, which is so special

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 according to Buddha teaching. Because this Southern continent is the place of the opportunities.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And this is also where you can develop things. There is also not always easy, not always

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 so kind of like as lala lamps. Which is, in the Buddha's teaching, is good because the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 challenge makes ourselves stronger, deeper, and we go to more, in a way, training. Training,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 without the training, we won't be stronger. This naturally, there are so many trainings.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Physically trainings, mentally trainings, and psychological trainings, trainings,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 trainings, trainings, trainings. And we cannot keep up that. We make each time stronger,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 stronger, and stronger. That's why. Therefore, this, the Southern continent is so special.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And for that, as I said, it's called land of opportunity. In the Buddha's teaching,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 zamling leja sabha, zamling leja sabha, where you perform the karmic activities here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 For example, like three other continents, East, West, North, God's rain, and animal rain,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 all those are mainly going through the result what they did.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 The karmic concept is what they did. There's not many new karmic things happening, things.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 They are spending, whether they're good or bad, spending their vast deeds.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 This war, therefore, is the land of karma, the Southern continent,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 where you perform the activity, not just spending the karma that you had,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 but you are creating new vision, new goal, new activities.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And therefore, this is the best place in the Buddha's teaching.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 So here, among that, all the Southern continents to be born in the Southern continent is difficult.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Among the Southern continents, there is also many places, no dharmas.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 And so where the dharmas places, it's real.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Among those places, even now, it's more kind of clarifying about the freedoms.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Even if you're born as a human being, but if some of our organs are defective,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 such as we are new to other people, what's called this?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Dev. Dev, yeah, that's true.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Dev, or some kind of organs are missing, then even if you have the beautiful intention in heart,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 really you cannot communicate so well.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 You can't see four advantages.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Therefore, we're not so lucky, so fortunate.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Therefore, we have to glorify our richness, highest things.
