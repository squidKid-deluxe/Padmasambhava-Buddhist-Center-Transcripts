00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
 "Of course, the Vajrasattva practice is the, generally, that is the principle practices,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the addition practice is then these Gymsak practices in the Tibetan language, called Gymsak,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.400
 in Sanskrit, it's known as Yajja or the Homer, and then, I think, commonly named as fire puja,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:33.200
 called, but it is more than fire puja. It is visualization, it is meditation, it is vibhachana

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 practices, it is shamatha practices, combined with the glorified bodhicata, love and compassion,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 kindness, joy, the all the goodness quality that inherited in our natural mind is pulled up and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.480
 brought up together and practicing today here. So therefore, Vajrayana practice is considering

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.040
 the most powerful practices, because it's not just only emphasizing one aspect of nature of the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.840
 mind,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.080
 but it brings all the goodness qualities, every aspect, surface, deep, sight, on top, bottom,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.120
 every aspect of the beauty of the mind, the natural quality, which is often known as the Buddha

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.800
 nature,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 that I think many of you may be heard that name, that really brings up these. So this practice of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.880
 the Vajrasattva, practice of Vajrayana practice, not just remembering the mantra itself and that,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.080
 but if you really concentrate your mind with the song, with the breath, with the energy,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.610
 with the open, with the love, with the compassion, with the kindness, and you are middle of that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 all

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 glorified, the beauty of the nature of the mind. That's why this is Vajrayana practice,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.600
 known as the most powerful, sweet practice of the getting enlightenment, or fulfill our goal,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.520
 that we can benefit to all beings. So therefore, that is what we practice. For example, when we

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.680
 reside in the mantra, we're not just residing in the mantra, in every kind. We are residing in the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 mantra with meditation, which is commonly known as samatha, vipashana combined together, your

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.720
 breathing,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.760
 your air, your mind, your energy, all condensed in one single state with love and joy,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.560
 and compassion. That is the most powerful practice, very soothing, calming,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.680
 and very beautiful, rewarding practices. That is what Vajrayasatva practices. When we visualize the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 Vajrayasatva, for example, in the beginning of time, many of you know the mantra, the dharma,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 red, and so I don't have to repeat again and again that, because then you receive this teaching,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.560
 that means we have to keep that practice, not just a record, or I want that practices,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.640
 I want that teaching, I want that, I want that. If we started thinking that, then we are not

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.080
 almost like we are kind of ignoring the practices. We're not really keeping up the practice up to

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.400
 current, but you sense you went so many teachings and so many practices, this is now we are keeping

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.720
 up that. You are, we are in that status. For example, in the beginning of time here, here in the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.080
 this is the reminder of our meditation, our zukkin meditation, our vipachana meditation,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.160
 our shamatha medit, reminder of the shamatha meditations. That means removing all the duality,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.320
 habejapatam, publications that are bothering our life, up to life, we will put that

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.440
 completely removed or read out. We are sitting right center of the true nature itself,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.410
 self and this, that is the reminding. And so this, look at this, how beautiful this practice begins

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.600
.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.120
 Om is all this phenomena existing, Om generally symbolize the body aspect of the Buddha,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.200
 Buddha often known as this poem, permission. And of course, also Om has meanings, Sanskrit

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.000
 language has many different natural meanings to that. But this time Om is all the permission,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.400
 all phenomena existing, that all phenomena existing is also so harmonizing, so archbishops,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:58.090
 archbishops means harmonizing, how beautiful, how balanced, but yet it is as it said in Maha Shun

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.320
eta.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:09.840
 Maha means great, great. And Shuneta means emptiness, the openness, the great openness.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 The great emptiness, great infinite. This means all phenomena existing of this

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.160
 is great openness, great harmonizing and great infinite status.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 That Shuneta, Maha Shuneta, openness is not just weak Shuneta, weak, blank emptiness.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:44.960
 That's what he said, Jana Benjara. Jana is wisdom. Wisdom many times we think is kind of

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.920
 intelligence,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.760
 it's true is intelligence and knowledge, but wisdom is combined with compassion. The true

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.960
 wisdom is compassion, true wisdom is love, it's caring, concerning, knowing of what things

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:11.840
 happen in the phenomena world, exactly. Therefore you are outreaching, unconditional, outreaching,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:24.160
 call it, serpentine without burden, without heavy, that is the intelligence. So this great Shuneta

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:33.120
 is filled with that Jana. Jana is Sanskrit word, again wisdom, the primordial wisdom.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.400
 And then what he said next, Vajra. Vajra of course many of again you all know this,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:52.240
 Vajra is indestructible, unchangeable, unbreakable. This nature of love and compassion of wisdom

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.200
 that filled with openness is inseparable, inbreakable, inbreakable, indestructible.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.040
 That is the beauty of the nature of this mind. Yet even though it is inbreakable, even though

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.840
 it is indestructible, yet it has no kind of like burden to us. For example our love and compassion

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:21.120
 is filled with the nature of the mind, mind but there's no burden, no is kind of like any

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:29.760
 kind of like this drugging. It is so open and so relaxed yet is indestructible, in unseparable

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:38.080
 status. And that is what we are practicing here. Vajrasad of practice is that is what

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:45.040
 practicing. Compassion and love target them and wisdom, that is practice. And Vajra Kala is

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.680
 practice,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.160
 that is what is practices. And that then is what said so bhava. So bhava is what? This beautiful

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:02.400
 openness, the great emptiness, intelligence was inseparable. It's not just born from somewhere else

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.400
,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:12.000
 or it came from somewhere else, or it's not kindly we got that later while ago, or once

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.960
 and while we get that. But no, it is natural. Therefore it's so bhava means nature. It's a

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:28.000
 natural qualities. It is with us. And today for example practice of Vajrasad, we're revealing

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.360
 that qualities. This is hidden, blurred, obscured by our own actions of the ego clingings,

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:51.840
 ego maniacs, and ego obscurations. It was obscured, not just obscured for one time or three times.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.760
 This has been the life after life because ego is very tricky, tricky. Ego is very naive in one way.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:07.760
 And ego is many times put a very kind of low key, low key naive. It tricks us.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:17.920
 And it's manipulation, it manipulates. It carried and then what it does, it just drags down us,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.960
 pulls down in the ditch one after another. And therefore habit pattern, the bad habit pattern,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.760
 is so easy to catch. It's kind of soothing in one way. That is tricky. Ego is tricky.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:44.560
 And ego is obstacle. But this nature is always abiding, no matter whatever the situation,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.640
 circumstances we go through, is altered. And that's what it says. It's so bhava. It's so bhava.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:10:01.440
 And then next sentence here, what is it? Next word, atma, guham. Atma means ego. Atma is ego.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:11.360
 And atma is grasping and clinging. Grasping and clinging, no matter whatever we're grasping,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.280
 clinging it. It is source of pain, source of suffering. When we don't have the grasping and

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:26.640
 clinging, our nature flows so beautifully. Love and compassion and wisdom come so easily.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.600
 And this is always, it brings the bright, always bright. But ego and grasping and clinging,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.640
 it is obstacle. And therefore, this is free from the obstacle. Atma, guham. Free from the

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:51.920
 atma, free from the ego. Ego, guham. So this is the really the, in one way, this whole sentence,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:59.680
 this Sanskrit is the reminding of, of all our practices, or this is the congruence of the

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:06.400
 practice of our vajasattva. Jamsic practices, vajasattva practice. Then it went a little bit

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.880
 elaborated, and it's translated. I don't have to translate it. And how beautiful is it? All

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:22.000
 phenomena samsara and nirvana are organically unborn, emptiness-proof. All phenomena of the

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.880
 samsara and nirvana are organically unborn, emptiness-proof, which, which then unceasing

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.600
 emanation of compassion. And this is so beautiful, you know. When you join this, it's so calming,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.920
 so soothing. We reach the, go to the new levels of our, where we are, we used to be. It's something

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.240
 very soothing. And that all begins. And then the beautiful display begins, one after another.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.720
 The unfolding display of the vajasattva. So beautiful. This is the words of the Gopeng

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.880
 Masambha. Words of the great master, Junmi Dorji, the manateeji. It's a vital word. Each

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.120
 sentence really begins. So beautiful, it's unfolding. So this soothing, calming, there's

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.880
 no kind of like partitions or kind of propagations. Blore, so calm, soothing. You just say kind of,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:22.400
 almost like that, what's called? Sailing. Sailing your sailboat, very calm ocean.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:30.960
 Just, oh, you reach the cruise level. Completely cruise level. Relax and rest and there's nothing.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:38.240
 Now enjoy the panoramic of the beauty. And that's really how it is. All that begins. So this is the

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:45.600
 what we practice. This is the all combination of the like, as I said, Shama practices,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.360
 Vibhachana practice, all that. For example, when we reside in a mantra, not just a kind of

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.400
 reside in a mantra and mind is wondering, but when you reside in a mantra, when you reside in a

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.360
 mantra, we stay with that sound. Stay with this spray, this spray what you shine. Radiating light,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.760
 a compassion, love, and all this, then we are really the most powerful state of meditation.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.880
 Vibhachana meditation, all that. Not just a kind of like forceful meditation, just kind of holding,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.640
 so steady in like this. But we realize and yet we experience the mostly deepest state of the

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.880
 nature of the mind and nature and all that. So therefore, when we reside in mantra, again,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.120
 with this, trying to bring up those beautiful qualities. Look at this here. This, what it does.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.000
 Not just we are residing in a mantra, say this word with it up and down. But here, for example,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.600
 in page 17, here, see it. See it. And I mean, just you read. We read this. Spreading light and

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.080
 making offerings to the noble ones and gathering all their blessings and purifying the obscurations

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.080
 of all the sentient beings, not just a one or two or three or four, or not just a group,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:11.040
 but all the beings purifying. And then that again brings what? The light returns and

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.760
 emerges in the once a mantra garlandess. And so beautiful actions all happening everywhere we

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.000
 reside in mantra. All beautiful, beneficial activities really happening in visible,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.320
 in the cyber highway, in a way, cyber, that you're sending emanating that, that in performance. And

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.480
 that's why all those great masters achieved such a high realization. These masters, we call open

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.360
 masters, but they are great practitioners. They practice. They're great at the courage and

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.360
 commitment, the joyful effort, love and compassion. That's what we call the great masters. And they

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.990
 did this practice in performing all these beautiful activities and actualizing many different

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.440
 levels

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.240
 of the fulfillment to benefit one's own or themselves to the other.
