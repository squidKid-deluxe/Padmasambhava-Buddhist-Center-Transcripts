00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Regain your awareness of the slightly of the concentrate or meditation of in this lifetime.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 That moment actually in the teaching scene, you really stop or you change the direction instantly.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 So that time is so, so what's called, powerful, so crucial, but also slightly situation can change.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 It's very easy because there's no mind nature of the physical and no any other also made it too

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.000
 much.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And only your mind is alone now in a way and therefore it can change very easily, you know.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.320
 So therefore you use it as waking up, instantly you wake up, wake up that long kind of lightweight

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 dreams.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.490
 You wake up, moment you wake up in that moment and you connect to that what you work to are,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.000
 immediately that, that and then change the direction.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 But somehow again we miss the, we didn't happen there then and the teaching sit here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And now this is according to example taking birth in the human relationship.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Now still we distant because our mind is with us, our conscious is with us.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 So therefore then single grade wish or single grade as pressures connect to family with our common

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 good kindness.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 So that means our good practice in this lifetime.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.630
 Still, still, still and you, you can stop the warm birth or birth and go to the period as I said,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.000
 moment you wake up that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 But somehow if we miss that then we should try to be now have more pure perceptions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And the pure perceptions are related with visualizations.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Visualization when we did this during the lifetime, we met it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.220
 When you are the deity, we visualize the deity and this time again, we strengthen your

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.000
 visualization, your perceptions.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And particularly in the teaching said, now you are going to take the good birth.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And good birth is again, can throw the kind of wind or throw the kind of consequence.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Our consciousness are wondering through that balance, around that balance.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 That home we will become our parents.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.180
 So our consciousness wind is wondering around that balance, many times in the teaching said,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.000
 according to our karma.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Karma, if we are going to be as a girl, we start to have a little more attachment to the father.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Father and then let them all distant to the mother.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And we are going to become our karma as a boy, then opposite.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Let the attachment to the mother and let her distant to the father.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And that's what he in the teaching said.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 The word jealousness, so let the jealousness attitude.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.230
 Jealousness attitude, jealous is of course we all know, jealous is the combination of attachment

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 and the angle or distant thoughts.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 So accordingly our karma, and then that can happen.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.360
 If that happens, our life will be very emotional, very emotional, and very, very again, kind of

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 heavy cards.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So if we remind, if we remember our visualization, even if we didn't remember our visualization,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 we try to involve love and compassion, body to the top that we can.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.870
 And then in the teaching said, if we can, jealousness, we realize where is the father, father and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.000
 mother goodness.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 All the men and the female put up.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Where is jealousness? Where is the daughters? Where is the girlfriend or someone? Someone.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And we can realize that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 That moment that we concept it in the teaching said, then our conception will become very special.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.610
 Special, and then if that happens, that happens, then staying in the warm is all in a way with

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.000
 awareness,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 with the practices, practices.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And those many great master's life story, they meditate, they practice it, practice it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.470
 And staying in the warm 10 months, according to that teaching, it is similar as a 10th building

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.000
 status.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And you stay 10 months, and after 10 months you come, then 11th building is reaching in life.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.870
 It is all, there are other symbols, other signs, other kind of low key element that we can

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.000
 highlight that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.190
 Starting with the visualization as parent, as male and female Buddha or Guru, and that is very

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.000
 special.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And then you have more awareness during the warm time, more clarity.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 So that is the end of this Vada of the Become.
