00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.630
 Kata Gurus and this is another teachings and Mahat, combination essence of Mahayoga, Anayoga, and

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.520
 Adiyoga teachings as well.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.280
 And with this again, this teaching was debate by the great master Murabaya Masama.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.800
 When Murabaya Masama came to debate in the 8th century, one of his first teachings was

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 teachings on Adiyoga's, Adiyoga teaching, he gave these 9 select students, and says that this

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.880
 teaching is then continuing, continuing until now, from the Kama lineage and the Tenma lineage is

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:46.160
 continuing. And today's teaching is particularly Tenma lineage, is revered by very few moves,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.240
 we know Tsak, Tethu, known as Tsaksonoma, you all know. But I'm talking this according lineage,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.560
 again even though we already know, but we strengthen our joy, appreciation, and and our

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.600
 devotions. For that reason, I'm talking, again that's lineage. So it's revered by great Tenma Tsak

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.240
sonoma.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.880
 Tsaksonoma, there were so many different Tenma teachings that related with Adiyoga,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.640
 and Anoyoga, and Adiyoga teachings, but among these, this is one of his famous Tenma teachings,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.040
 that he revered is from southern Tibet. Southern Tibet, now in that territory falls, I think in

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.880
 Arunachaporti, it's the part of the Indian, it's called the Chauta where he revered. We have

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 this beautiful, and introduction story is that this, our beautiful book, we have known as the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
 Dark Red Amalekt, which is, I'm talking about the beautiful, adequate, detailed, and viable,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.760
 kind of precisely mention those things. So therefore you can read that, but however,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.200
 he revered this, there were teaching from that. And then as we did revere this teaching, and this

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.880
 is continuing, and many greater Tenma masters also appreciated this teaching, particularly

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 Great Chancing. The folks in Chancing mentioned also this teaching is one of the world's best

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 because it's the union of the Yandai, Haruka, and Vedekalaya together, so this such teaching is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.920
 quite

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 rare among the Tenma teachings. That is what Thasong gave us. And as Thasong gave us,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 this teaching is continued in our areas, particularly, and then I received this teaching,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.080
 one of the young, one of the leading great masters of this lineage, known as Lama Numa,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 I received this teaching from these great teachers. And afterward, I received this teaching many

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.160
 times,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.200
 from Venerable Kedki Pharnishar, many a time, this. And ever since of this, this practice

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 becomes one of the important practices of our family. Father used to do this practice all the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.440
 time, non-stop, since I remember him. Every day he do these practices, and Kedki, everybody does

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.040
 that too, and I followed with their echoes and footsteps. I've been also practicing this. So this

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.720
 is one of the important practices of the lineage, important practices of the teaching, and the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.440
 importance of the Thasong Numa, and that is, in a way, a brilliant history of these teachings.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.880
 The Tenma, as an empowerment, you basically again know that, but again, according to the lineage,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.280
 I imagine, have to say. And so then empowerment is very, very important, special importance of the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.480
 Vadiyana teachings, and Vadiyana teaching, and there's so many skillful means. Among that,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 all skill means of teaching, empowerment is one of the very powerful things, because it's

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.320
 directly introduced into the nature, where things are, and instantly removing the curtains of the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 dualities in public areas. It gives an instant behold in the natures, and it's aspirating the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.040
 lineage blessings of love and compassion that continue from the Buddha, Shakyamuni, or the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.120
 Buddha, Samadabhadra, and all between now, and instant it's aspirating. So therefore, this

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 empowerment and lineage is so special. It's one of the very special teachings. And as in the Vadiy

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.440
ana

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.240
 teaching, always an empowerment is asked to work, for example, Abhishekha, which means

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.640
 pouring and despairing, pouring the lineage blessings, and blessings of love and compassion,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.640
 despairing the happy dependent and the dualities, and those are the great meanings. So that's what

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.880
 it is. So therefore, this lineage is very authentic, beautiful. It is also essence teaching of the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.520
 Buddha Shakyamuni, essence teaching of the Nghurapayama and Samadabhadra, essence and important

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.920
 practice

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.960
 of Nghurapayama, what's the definition of that, and then continuing this. So that is the really

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.400
 of the introductions of these teachings. Now, we begin the actually empowerment itself by the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.360
 principle of ceremony, and that begins with now again, as you already behold it, as you are already

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.480
 in that status. But now, let's begin again one more kind of reigniting, kind of activating,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.880
 re-glorifying our realization where the beauty of the nature is. And now, I'm going to join.
