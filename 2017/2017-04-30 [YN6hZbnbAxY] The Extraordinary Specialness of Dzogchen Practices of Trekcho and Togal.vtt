00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.750
 Merit, for three countless aeon. The first one countless aeon accumulated merit, wisdom merit,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.000
 accumulated merit. He got realization of the past goodness.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.410
 This is not just a hymn, a cold Bodakshatyamuni, in general, in Mahayana. So that's how it lay out.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 Then you continue to practice. Now you see the same path. You've got to see. What means the same

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.000
 path? You see the true nature, exactly as it is.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 Exactly as it is. Before that kind of most theoretical, again, of course, the realization goes.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.000
 Before the first, what is the according path? Accumulation path, application path.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.080
 And the application path, during that time, you got more realization. It's not just a kind of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.000
 theoretical, but not so clear. Exactly. Still.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.390
 But when you see the first, we were saying path, it's a synonym. First Bumi and the same path, syn

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:12.000
onym. That time, you see clay, crystallite, exactly as it is. Now, no theorems, the theorems.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.620
 So now the zooky techniques, by these techniques, instant techniques, we really discovering,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.280
 connecting that, instant that realization. But however, again, we don't have long experience, long

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 kind of like accumulation, then it blows away.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.800
 But this is, therefore, this zooky teaching, all the international teachings are so fast to reach

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.000
 enlightenment, or to discover our nature.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.390
 Then in the Buddha's teaching, again, for example, Buddha's approach, then second accumulation, to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:01.050
 reach the seventh Bumi, according to the seventh Bumi, you accumulated the second countless years

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.000
 to reach the seventh Bumi.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.620
 And the third Bumi, from third, so that means, from the act 9-10, you're accumulating that another

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 accumulation. That's the accord of Buddha Shakyamuni himself. He went through that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And the teaching said, the gracious teacher said that, and then become the Buddha.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 But zooky teaching instantly connected. That is a trick you. But now adding further, not just to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.330
 only discover the Buddha's nature, or discover the Sammana Badra, but all the richness of Sammana

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.000
 Badra, now we discover, richness of Sammana Badra, what is known as, according to the teaching.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 Sambukhaya, we heard Sambukhaya is so luxurious, so luxurious, always enjoying, always enjoying the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.000
 five certainties, enjoys.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.050
 That richness is discovering right this lifetime, every joyful effort, every devotion, courage and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.000
 commitment, all those obligations what teaching taught.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.520
 So therefore, Trichu, sorry, Togalai, is so special, so powerful, but yet it needs rest on the Tr

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.000
ichu because of our habit, our dualities.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 It could be spoiled. We can spoil it. So for that reason, this is what Trichu is needed.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 What if the brain is very successful of the Togal practices?
