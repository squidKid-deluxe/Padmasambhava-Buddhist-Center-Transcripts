00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 "All arising samadhis, all arising samadhis is also known as compassion samadhis. That tells you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 why cut the angles, but that regular wrath, that great emptiness is not just blank emptiness,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 it's not just negation status, it's filled with the energy. That energy is compassion, compassion.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:46.690
 Therefore we said the regular wrath that cuts the anger, when you have great compassion, there is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.000
 no name of anger at all existing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 There is sunlight and darkness. When there is sunlight, there is no trace of the name of darkness

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.000
 existing. We have those who have great pure compassion.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.960
 That moment, the anger is gone, not just only anger, all the other emotions are gone. What are the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.000
 other emotions? Such as jealous, hated thoughts, attachment, arrogance, and doubt and hesitations,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 skeptical ideas.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.770
 All those just melted, melted where in that dharma, dhatu, in that certainness, meditrache, or

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.750
 great emptiness states, all melted, all transcendentness, what is now coming up is great compassion

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.000
, great loving kindness.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.010
 All 5 of us are beginning to shine through. Where ever the nature of the emptiness or dharmakaya

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:04.160
 nature is, that far is compassion, that far is loving kindness, that far is wisdom, all those are

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.000
 Muslims.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 That is what the nature is. That is the absolute vedigalaya arising in the form of compassion.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.120
 So vedigalaya is compassion, not just anger, it is full of compassion, full of love, and full of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.000
 all those words.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So again, this arising, all manifestation samadhi, what is all it means? It is arising energy,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 already I mentioned, it is arising energy.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 Because of this arising energy, it is also known as transcendent. It is transcendent our regular

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.000
 habit pattern in the divine mandalas, divine mandalas.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.220
 Therefore, it is known as also the great magic. This compassion is like great magic, the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.000
 combination of great compassion and emptiness, or the absolute truth.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The combination of it is like great magic, that well, the magic of the great transformations.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 It will transform all habit patterns of the gross levels into divine mandalas, mandalas.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.330
 Because of that, and then also it will transform, it is great, also it is named like this, what is

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.000
 called this, this comparison, samadhi, or arising samadhi, is named as magic of skilful means.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 It is also named magic of skilful means. Why is called magic of skilful means?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Because when you arise this nature in your heart, when you realize it, that every neurotic mind,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 neurotic state, self-important thoughts,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 all that completely removed, completely transcendent, it is all natural state, natural state.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Therefore, it is known as magic of the skilful means, magic of the skilful means.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Then is also known as the magic of the great Muslims. Why is it called the great Muslims?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 Because even though it is a very different form and different images, for example, we visualize all

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.000
 those deities, mandalas,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 they are no other than the display of compassion and loving kindness.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 It is compassion and loving kindness, a pain in that form.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So therefore, it is known as great transformation practices.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And also, when we have these great companions, what does that do?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Also, then it has become the union of compassion and emptiness.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.170
 That is the heart essence of the practice of the Buddha's teachings, union of emptiness and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.000
 compassion.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 If we practice only emptiness, then we are not really touching the heart of the natures.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Natures, we neglect it. We are not completely fully, completely perfect practices.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.710
 When compassion and great emptiness or wisdom join together, that is perfect meditation and perfect

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.000
 practices.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.950
 So therefore, this is known as the great compassion, the great transformation of magic of the great

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.000
 Muslims.
