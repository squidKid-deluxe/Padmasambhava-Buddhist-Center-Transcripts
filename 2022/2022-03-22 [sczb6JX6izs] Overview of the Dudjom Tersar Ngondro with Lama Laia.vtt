00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.840
 As usual, we all, just kind of recognizing our place, we have the great good fortune to be

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.040
 able to be here individually and together, both in this room and then through modern technology

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.600
 throughout the world. That's special and precious, and we've inherited the full body of the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.980
 Buddhist

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 teachings, and that's basically broken down into, you know, the Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 all practiced as a great unity. And right from the beginning, we want to touch the heart

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.680
 of the practice, and that's why all the great masters always remind us, before we begin

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.960
 any activity, especially study, contemplation practice, connecting with the heart of these

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.480
 three vehicles, which is what? Our joy, our devotion, really just recognizing out of all

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.400
 the situations that are possible, we're free of so many circumstances and habitual patterns

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 that would prevent us to be reflecting on our own beautiful nature and trying to bring

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.720
 those qualities up in our own minds and hearts for the benefit of all. Just really appreciating

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.880
 that and then of course, and then really connecting with a mind and heart, just vast bodhicitta,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 which is the essence of Mahayana, both generating it and actualizing it, really truly aspiring

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.720
 that in this precious moment, it can really bring benefit to limitless beings beyond any

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.320
 of our current limitations and capacities. And then the heart of the Vajrayana is our

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.720
 pure perception, our devotion, our trust, and the innate goodness of everything. And

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 in a way, the perfection of this moment when we really take responsibility for every aspect

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.560
 of our experience to the best of our ability taken to our mind, just how everything, all

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.800
 forms, all appearances, are perfect and pure, all thoughts and movement are perfect and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.320
 pure, all awareness, our mind and its openness is perfect and pure. And that within the relative

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.360
 truth is totally infused with the absolute truth, they're completely inseparable. And

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.640
 therefore, this moment is very, might seem common, but we want to see the uncommon, beautiful

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.400
 preciousness of this moment. It really is, this is recognizing this perfectly pure now

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 is the perfect moment to wake up and purify, to do good deeds, to receive blessings, to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:28.120
 remove our own veils and obscurations and their causes. So we'll just take a few moments just

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 to be with that.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:20.480
 Okay, so then, we'll just take a few moments, a few minutes to reflect a little bit. Again,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.600
 I mentioned before, I think there are several new people here, and some of us have been

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.960
 practicing a long time, sometime maybe just beginning, and then a lot of us in between.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.840
 So just kind of going over some of the basics of what we're doing with nundro, and then

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:51.360
 I think I especially just want to encourage, you know, practicing. So, we all know in that

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 light, nundro teachings and practice embodies all of the Buddhist teachings, we've heard

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:17.040
 that, we know that. So, really reflecting on kind of what that means in a nutshell I think

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:27.520
 is helpful, right, because often the nundro teachings embody all the Buddhist practices,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.800
 all the Buddhist teachings, very simply kind of the core essence of how we progress. So

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:44.400
 how do we take that into our daily lives? You know, sometimes the nundro we've all heard

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:53.440
 is translated as preliminary, and I think often, again, the great masters really kind

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.160
 of really want us to make sure we understand clearly that by preliminary, doesn't mean

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.560
 it's like a task we have to check off our list, or a form we have to fill out to get

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.960
 by customs, or something like that, that it's somehow baby stuff, but more so, nundro is

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.840
 preliminary and that it's essential. All these aspects we have in the nundro practices are

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.240
 essential to our practice, and like Kim Poseong-Wampushe says, the nundro practice is from now

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.880
 until

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.800
 enlightenment, and that's why these skillful means of these really simple practices can

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:53.880
 bring us to that, all the way to enlightenment, just keep going. And so, first, we have our

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.640
 formal practice, and the formal practice of nundro, again, I'm just going to go over the

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.160
 basics of the structure, right, we have within our practice, we have what are known as the

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:14.060
 three frames, or three noble ones, a good way to have our formal practice be kind of effective

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.480
 and have a nice container, that means it has a beginning, middle, and we're starting like

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.000
 I just mentioned a few moments ago, with a mind and heart of joy, devotion, courage,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.840
 commitment, bodhicitta, devotion, just really reveling in the preciousness of the moment

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.560
 and sparking with that, with love and devotion for all the lineage, feeling the presence

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.380
 of the three jewels, the three roots, and our trust in the three jewels, doing our lineage

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.620
 prayers, kind of setting that basis of the heart of the practice, and then with nundro

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.400
 in particular, that kind of blends in with the four thoughts that turn the mind toward

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:10.180
 the Dharma, with refuge, which is essentially affirming our deep trust and joy in the Buddha,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.840
 in the Buddha's teachings, and all those who uphold them, and in our own, in the innate

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.800
 goodness and beautiful potential of our own mind, and our own experience to be totally

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:32.440
 free, and that all beings can have that, so generating that really thought of enlightenment

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:40.240
 for all beings, which is bodhicitta, and then we're generating merit through the third part,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:49.120
 which is making the mandala offerings to the three jewels, on top of accumulating our merit,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.640
 increasing our joy, appreciation, our bodhicitta, we're also purifying our obscurations and

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.920
 mistakes, purifying the ultimate mistake we have, which is not recognizing our nature,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.280
 getting caught up and tangled up in our conceptions and our hopes and our fears, dragging them

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:16.680
 around in all kinds of drama and boringness, etc., etc., but purifying that, so purifying

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.480
 the ultimate mistake we have, which is just simply not recognizing our nature, through

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.840
 the skillful means of the Vajrasattva practice, and then also purifying all the relative abstains

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:37.200
 and mistakes and obscurations we have, again, all the way from our most common, rough, emotional,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.200
 and karmic obscurations that we're creating, kind of passing them, purifying them through

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.200
 to our more subtle knowledge obscurations and very subtle habitual patterns are being purified

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.360
 all the way to enlightenment, and then the supreme guru yoga is the real heart of the

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:05.040
 practice of mingling our own mind with the mind of the fully enlightened state embodied

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:16.680
 as guru Padmasambhava, inseparable from all appearances of our own mind, liberating our

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.480
 own mind, okay, and once we spend our time with that, which we're going to do after I

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:32.560
 finish talking, we always dedicate the merit, again, all the positive results of our practice,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:40.080
 getting that for all the limitless beings throughout all time, all space, all possibilities, that

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.320
 the positive effects of our study, our practice, our meditation, our actions can really just

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:57.200
 dedicate it to be a boundless source of refuge and support for all beings, no matter where,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.640
 and like the Buddha reminds us to, we can also dedicate that, all of our past deeds,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:11.520
 our present deeds, our future deeds, those of other, everyone, from the most simple act

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:19.040
 of refraining from harm to the most supreme enlightenment, just totally rejoicing and dedicating

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:29.600
 that, and making time for the formal practice is so important. So, you know, when we talk about how

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:40.000
 to bring practice into daily life, it might sound kind of snarky, but really being mindful of how

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.130
 much time we're going to really set aside for some formal practice is important, because we can

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:48.200
 have,

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:54.360
 of course, we're blessed by receiving so many teachings, and we can contemplate them to some

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:05.000
 degree, but really absorbing them into our heart and just letting, letting the practice take its

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.160
 effect, you know, on a deeper level than just our intellect is so beautiful and so important, and

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.640
 maybe as we do that, the more we recognize how beautiful and good that is. So again, as far as

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.440
 bringing dharma into daily life, we want to always actually make a little time for formal practice

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:33.400
 that's reasonable and practical, you know, in relation to the other things we're also committing

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:40.720
 to do, but if we really want to practice, if that's part of our idea, making sure we're actually

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.000
 making a little time for ourselves to practice is good, and within that apply these three frames

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.400
 and

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:58.360
 doing whatever our practice is, in this case our nundra practice. So forgive me, I'm being a little

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:11.020
 bit very general here, but just kind of going over these, these basics. So generally, our Buddhist

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.600
 practice too, you know, when we think about nundra, I kind of just was very briefly going over the

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.680
 formal practice we have, which is called, right, there's two kinds of practice we have, meditation,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.340
 post-meditation. So of course, our daily life for most of us is more than just sitting on the

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:31.560
 cushion

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:46.720
 and having a formal practice session. But just like the nundra practice isn't just a preliminary

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:56.160
 thing that we get by and check off and leave behind us as we move on to something else, I think for

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:05.200
 myself and all of us just kind of trying to really maintain whatever we come upon in our formal

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:16.480
 practice, it's touching that home base. So really trying to bring the atmosphere of what we find

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.520
 when

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:26.100
 we're studying, when we're contemplating, especially when we practice and dedicate the merit,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.240
 bringing

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:33.520
 that out into the other aspects of our life outside of that very special precious time and place

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:33.880
 for

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.600
 our formal practice we reserve in the day, but like not leaving the atmosphere of our nundra

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.080
 practice

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:52.280
 behind with that. So again, that's kind of saying the obvious, but I think it's kind of important

00:14:52.280 --> 00:15:01.760
 because I, for one, sometimes just really forget the obvious. And then of course, just as we're in

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:10.200
 the day, we can from time to time, reflect back to our mind. Rinpoche always says he's three thing,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:18.160
 three assistants that help us throughout anything, whether it's our formal practice or our informal

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:29.440
 practice through our meditation or post meditation. That's just keeping mindful, keeping gently

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:29.960
 relaxed

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:40.950
 manner, mindful of our intentions, our view, seeing how much our conduct is following through with

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:41.120
 our

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:51.680
 our true intentions and what we currently understand, you know, the teachings to be. And so we can

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.440
 always, of course, in the day, reflect on within nundra, reflect on the thoughts from time to time,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:12.440
 reflect first, just take a moment, relax, step back, look to our own mind. We can just in life,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:21.960
 see everything we can find in the in the four thoughts that turn the mind, living examples, kind

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:28.760
 of recognize the pressure, our freedoms and our endowments and kind of see where how much we're

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:42.320
 engaging with them and appreciating them. How much we're either seeing impermanence, expecting

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:52.550
 things to be fixed and everlasting, and always the way they they seem now forever. Or how much we

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.720
're

00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:01.440
 recognizing how everything's always moving. And how much we're keeping in mind, you know, the

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:09.680
 inevitability of karma of its, you know, how our attitude, how our view, our intention, our

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.360
 motivation,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.680
 you know, our story and how and then what we're doing with it is going to have its results. And

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:25.520
 they're going to always reflect the tone and the the attitude through which we say things and do

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:36.280
 things. And then just some sorrow, just really living example, looking especially inside ourselves,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:43.920
 but other examples of what we can see in the world of just discontentment, misunderstanding,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:54.960
 everyone wanting happiness. And on some level, not having it on all kinds of degrees, ourselves

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:10.400
 included. Just kind of having that living example as Dharma practitioners, that if we don't

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.080
 understand,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:19.210
 don't aren't recognizing our nature, and until we fully recognize it, we're always going to have

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.480
 some

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:28.500
 degree of uncomfortableness and dissatisfaction. And that's not like a punishment. That's, you know

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:28.560
,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:37.360
 that's just how it is until we we see more clearly. And then again, with refuge, as we're in our

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:37.600
 days,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:47.840
 reflecting on the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, the different levels of just what that means to

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.000
 us,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.120
 what that's what's that's what's been said to us, how we understand that, and how much how much are

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:09.760
 we really trusting in that and enjoying that and rejoicing in that and encouraging ourselves. And

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:21.510
 then of course, just connecting with our bodhicitta, our motivation, reflecting on these four

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.720
 thought,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:29.850
 you know, four boundless thoughts, four boundless motivations, that all beings without exception

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.960
 can

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:40.760
 be free of suffering and its causes, and happy, happy and have all that causes of happiness, know

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:48.880
 their true nature, which is totally without this harmony, and have all the fill fulfillments in the

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.040
 common level, too. And that all beings can have more and more of a boundless heart and not be

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.640
 discriminating between who deserves happiness and who doesn't really having that open heart. And

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:01.760
 then

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.920
 of course, actualizing how much we can just tune in with our own mind and view and make everything

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.040
 we

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.400
 do one of the Paramita practices, how much we can bring in an open attitude, bring in our, our

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.920
 wisdom

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:29.320
 to really infuse a heart, a generous heart, share what we can try to and as far as morality, seeing

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:29.320
,

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:37.840
 trying to see how much we're really align, lining ourselves up with what at, what at least we've

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.640
 heard or know, is a beneficial way to interact with the situations we're meeting, the people we're

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:56.320
 meeting, trying to be more patient, which means here, taking things as they are and allowing the

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:04.400
 process and keeping a joyful attitude, really trying to connect with our joyful effort and our

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.280
 our beautiful motivation that brought us to the Dharma, probably in the first place, keeping that

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:21.780
 fresh, and not getting distracted, really maintaining our concentration with what we're doing, not

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.360
 losing

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.840
 inside of what we're doing, you know, both on the Dharma level, but even on the common worldly

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.200
 level.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:35.880
 And then again, bringing our wisdom with everything, knowing things as they are both

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:46.400
 relatively, absolutely. It's beautiful. And then as far as mandala practice, you know, like we say

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.920
 formally, right, bodies, enjoyments, possessions, glories, the succession of all my lifetimes I

00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:02.200
 offer to the Buddha Dharma Sangha in order to accumulate all the merit and wisdom. So just we

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:09.000
 can kind of bring that attitude with us to with, you know, we're doing it on the cushion, but then

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.720
 when we stand up from the cushion, keeping that attitude with us to with our present body, our

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:24.840
 present luxuries, our present actions, kind of in keeping that pure view, however we can. And then

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:36.840
 of course, purifying our our mistakes through the Vajrasattva practice, but also just being open to

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:47.840
 recognize we don't always have the full picture, we all make mistakes. And having, you know,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:58.720
 recognizing it, doing what we can to purify it, and not repeat it. It's great. And then just

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.480
 keeping in our minds and heart, again, our awareness and the presence and blessings of the

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:15.240
 three jewels, the three roots embodied as Guru Padmasambhava. Just trying to keep that kind of

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:22.560
 that view with us, and that awareness from time to time, how that can relate to our Guru Yoga,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:31.200
 and then dedicate the merit. So I should start talking soon. But I'll just start to say, as far

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:44.280
 as both off the cushion, on the cushion, keeping the practice to the best of our ability. And like

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:52.440
 Rinpoche says, if we fall in the ditch, get up. And I think it's especially important that we

00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:01.600
 encourage ourselves, because we can have the practice and we can be really inspired. And we

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:09.640
 can be doing the practice. And then in doing the practice, we can begin to see more of maybe our

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:18.040
 obstacles, more of the things that are our basic assumptions and attitudes that aren't benefiting

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:26.480
 ourselves or others, undermining in all kinds of ways. And there can be all kinds of outer

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:38.560
 circumstances happening too. That can be really shocking and disturbing, but really trying to do

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:45.120
 the best we can to encourage ourselves to keep with the heart of the practice, at least in our

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:52.520
 attitude, and trying to keep some formal practice that really helps. Again, it's usually conception

00:24:52.520 --> 00:25:04.000
 to move beyond conception, to be more and more natural with our true nature. And so in that way

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 too, when we're doing our formal practice, we shouldn't always be expecting it to have the

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 same flavor every single time. And we shouldn't be undermining ourselves if we're having a more

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:32.680
 challenging time on whatever level. So keep, please, I'm talking to Laya too, but all of us,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.360
 I think we're all encouraged by our teachers to keep our practice and not have our practice have

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:54.280
 to be conditional, but trust in the effectiveness of the method. And keep going, do the practice.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.840
 And if you don't have time practically, maybe as much time as you did at some other time in

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:09.000
 your life, know what you can do right now to have like a nice container to do your practice and do

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.440
 it. I think, again, I haven't, and I don't think anybody's ever regretted doing practice. I know

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:23.200
 I've certainly regretted not doing practice, but doing the practice, not expecting to feel a

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.760
 certain

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:34.960
 way to have to be happy, to have to be joyful, or to have to be miserable, to have no expectations,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:43.880
 but to meet the practice as best we can as we are and do the practice. Let it really, again,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:52.980
 mingle with our heart. Because I think, again, for all of us, as we do the practice, it makes a

00:26:52.980 --> 00:27:03.360
 difference. So let's do the practice now. So again, just a little bit of touching home a little bit

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:11.120
 and trying to inspire in myself and all of us, especially this is while there's so much beauty

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.040
 blazing in the world, there also is obviously a lot of of tumult, and that's always the fact.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.600
 Sometimes it comes closer to home, but that's when we need, like, our joy, our devotion, and

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:36.000
 especially, like, Rinpoche say, our courage, our commitment. Please. Okay, so if we know we need to

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.400
 do the practice, and we've heard we need to do the practice, and we really, and we know, I just

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.640
 need

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:49.960
 to do this, you know? I know. So, but we still are stuck. So what are, like, some practical tips

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.640
 for

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.280
 daily life? I know I should do this, but I didn't. Tomorrow I know I should do it, and I didn't. So

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.490
 it can become, like, big rut, you know? Yep. So what are, like, things you found just really

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.960
 practical

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:20.440
 ways to, like, kind of just jump start? Do it. Which means, think about it. Think about, okay,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:30.360
 when, how much time do I have, practically speaking? How much practical time do I have to

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:39.440
 practice? With whatever our other obligations are, knowing our own kind of energy, you know? What

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.680
 can

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:46.520
 I do? What's the, in a way, we could think, what's the minimum amount of time I know I could always

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:55.920
 do a little bit of formal practice? So I can start it, do it, and finish it. Because for myself,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.080
 that's really helpful, and really feeling empowered to make that, and really remember the whole

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:02.400
 point

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:11.760
 of our practice. It's to benefit everything. Our whole day, this life, all lives, all beings, and

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.960
 it,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:19.040
 like we're told in the teachings, it starts now. So kind of keeping that in our mind, in our heart,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.240
 and again, our motivation, and really think and really reserve that special time we have, just like

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.480
 we would for anything we hold precious, but really thinking about why is Dharma practice precious

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:31.680
 to

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:42.550
 us, you know? So making that time and having it be something doable, you know, is really helpful

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:42.920
 for

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:53.960
 me. Because then if I am feeling a little bit uninspired, I also, or it's like gonna be a really

00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:04.580
 busy day, you know, then I know, oh wait, I have an hour, say, to practice, and then when I just

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.280
 get

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:13.520
 myself in that, then no matter what, I know in an hour I might as well relax and enjoy this, and

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:13.920
 then

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:23.300
 finish it, dedicate the merit, and there it goes. And I think like most two of our habits, they

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.560
 take

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:30.760
 a while to take effect. So I think definitely when we start a new thing, or have to restart a new

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:41.260
 thing, having that patience to kind of let it take effect and let ourselves experience what

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.880
 actually

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.880
 happens when we do it, instead of holding back from doing it for some reason. So that's what I

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.920
 mean by just do it. Just really do the practice and don't have to feel a certain way, just do it,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:03.220
 and have it have a clear beginning, a clear middle, a clear end. And if you have time, you know,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:11.000
 constraints, then make sure it gives seeing how it fits in your schedule. And then too, I know I

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.280
 find

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.520
 for myself, morning's good, that's maybe not the best for everyone, but so making the time, and if

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.600
 you need to do something, just get up and move around, have some hot water or some tea or coffee,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.520
 take a shower, and then go sit down. I don't know. I think that's really simple, because then

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.320
 everything else can start to take place. We've all heard some degree of instructions, and we've had

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:44.320
 some degree of practice, but I think just making that special time and place to do it, and just

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:51.600
 doing it, you know, that's kind of, is that too snarky or too simple an answer, I think, because

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.960
 they really just

00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:07.800
 do it. Let go. And, you know, so, so let's just do it. Unless does anyone else have something else

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.000
 to

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.920
 say or question? Because now, yeah. Yes, what's that?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:33:00.160
 Right. Yeah. Everyone has their own ways. That's good. I think in general, it's good to try to do

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.370
 something where you can really complete. And then if there's time to do more, do too. Again,

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:05.800
 everybody

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:13.880
 has different circumstances. But being able to complete the practice, I think, making sure that's

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:21.200
 something we can always do. So that's why maybe if your session can't be entirely as long as you

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.400
 wish

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.880
 it could be, you've done it. And then if there's time to do more, whether it's right then or later

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.480
 in the day, that's fabulous. There's no reason not to. But then there's that beautiful inspiration

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:35.680
 of

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:43.380
 like being able to start something, do it, finish it. Especially if maybe at the beginning of it,

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.480
 we

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:52.000
 were having resistance. Right. And that can be done fast too. Yeah. So say you're like, Oh, the

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.640
 doorbell rings ring ring, whatever. And you're in the middle of your practice, you forgot, then you

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:05.810
 could just one second dissolve. Then then we all have the easy to easy thing we've memorized by

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.120
 this

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:12.760
 merit may all obtain omniscience have four lines where it's just like the go to full on, give it

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.120
 away, make the offering complete and seal. And then at least I mean, that takes a solid 10

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:26.060
 seconds, then it seals. It's just as a quick that's like an emergency stop stop of leading. But

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.520
 quick,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.920
 but then in general, just like Lama lai saying, try to like really kind of round it out, like fully

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.040
.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:38.360
 But if we have to seal quick, then that's, yeah, it's doable. We can do this practice session could

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.240
 be a minute long and have a beginning, middle and end. But then we should try to grow that. Yeah.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:52.480
 And the, the dojum terso nundro, as we all know, it's so concise. And we want to be relaxing,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:35:01.440
 connecting with the meaning. But as we do that, if we really had to, you can do this whole practice

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:13.200
 in like five minutes, five minutes, but you know, what we can and really being able to savor it and

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.400
 connect. I mean, that's great. And that's why we do accumulations. And that's why we, we do the

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.600
 practice, but, but practice, I think it's quality, right, not quantity, whether it's the amount of

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:34.560
 time or the frequency. So now we've been talking, talking, talking, talking. So let's do a little

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:43.520
 practice. We'll just sit for a moment. And then we'll do a seven line prayer and go right to the

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:57.840
 practice. Thank you.
