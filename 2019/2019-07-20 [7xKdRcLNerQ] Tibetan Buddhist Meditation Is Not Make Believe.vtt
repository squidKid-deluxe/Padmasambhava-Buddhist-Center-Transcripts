00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.430
 I mean, maybe I can use it. It can be divided into three. Those are known as "sing everything" as

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.000
 the display of the Magyal.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Singing everything as the Magyal display is known as the "Magical visualization".

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:38.140
 Then the second visualization is known as the "realization of a poem and emptiness" of all insuffer

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.000
able states.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.560
 And it's naturally insufferable states. It's not that meditators are making poems and emptiness ins

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.000
ufferable, it's naturally emptiness.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 When you have that realization said, it's known as the "performed creative states".

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Even though it's named creative state, but it's not just creative act, that's what it is.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 These two are who realize this. Also these are realized by all the Mahayana practitioners, or those

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 great practice Mahayanas, Sukar Mahayanas.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.320
 And first of all, for example, every see as the Magyal display. Those are aharas. They can realize

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.900
 They see also that they are leaning towards, I mean, they are coming towards the closer to the way

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.000
 things are.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 How many? But they did not openly tell that all is enlightened.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 The third one, Magyalization, is then is known as the "Vigalization". Invoke the power of one's own

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.550
 nature and keeping up that as it is, or the nature of the mind, keeping up as it is with the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.000
 instructions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 That is what we are doing this, keeping up exactly, following the instructions, keeping up our

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.000
 innate natures, exactly as it is.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 That is our "Vigalization". Now this "Vigalization", nature or character is one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.620
 Characterization of the "Vigalization" is, actually, ourself, ourself, we visualize meditating, our

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.000
self as Buddha.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.150
 That Buddha, where it comes from? Where it comes from? This comes from the Buddha-nature, your

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.000
 Buddha-nature.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Your Buddha-nature is what? They call it teaching, not just your, my Buddha-nature, your Buddha.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 But Buddha-nature is the embodiment of "blessfulness-emptiness".

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.450
 "Blessfulness-emptiness". "Blessfulness-emptiness", that "blessfulness" is instantly appeared form

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.000
 of the deity.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.160
 How that appeared? According to the instructions in the Dantara teaching taught, or sadhana taught.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.000
 That happened.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.370
 So, reality, fundamentally, this deity, what we visualize, like Hayagirwa Vaidya, Vada is

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.000
 definitely born and known.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It is the great emptiness, great "blessfulness", union of the great "blessfulness", the emptiness.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.800
 And that is the Buddha-nature, and that is what Hayagirwa in Vaidya Vada is, or the Buddhas we

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000
 visualize.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 How we develop that? We follow accordingly, in stockings, as the Buddha taught in the Dantara,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 or sadhana taught by the Gurupin Masambha, according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Then we maintain that. So that is the essential meaning of the visualization.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So visualization is not something that you make up that. It is actually happening.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 When we reach the Buddha-hook, when we become our Buddha-nature, we become the Buddha.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 According to sadhana, the Buddha-haktam is one of the highest capability practitioners,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.450
 and his reach, the Buddha-haktam reach, the enlightenment of the Buddha-hood, up to three countless

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.000
 eons.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 That's the long way. But this one, for example, immediately we are activating ourselves with the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.000
 Buddha-hood.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.070
 Buddha-stages. So that is what this visualization is not something that we pretend that we are to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.000
 be that.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.490
 The total visualization of meditation, what we do immediately, is we are meditating, or we are

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.000
 instead what we are.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.560
 What we are is not what we are trying to be, or pretending that. Hopefully we do this, or by the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.000
 blessing I do that.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 It is, of course, a blessing, but it is what you are.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.700
 For that reason, in the visualization meditation, we are creating state practice, and of course,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.000
 complete state practice, too.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Always teaching says confidence. Confidence.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 This also sometimes in teaching says, I'm sure you heard of it, I said, very bright.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Very bright. B-R-I-D-E-I. Very bright.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Very bright is what you are. You are really keeping up that.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 That. We don't get shaken by the ego-claimless, duality bodies. Keep me up there.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 When you keep up that, what that Buddha has is full of love, full of compassion, full of wisdom.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.540
 That is radiating. All that we call light is being so light. All that looks like something like

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.000
 light.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 But that energy, that power of love and conviction is really emanating in every direction.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 That is coming. That is touching to every single living being.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 That is touching all the phenomenal environments, the world, and thus forming everything.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 That is the really meaning of these visualizations.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 The essential meaning, that is what is really meaning.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Now, with that understanding...
