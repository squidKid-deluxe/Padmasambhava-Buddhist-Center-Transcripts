00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 (The video is recorded at Padma Samye Ling Monastery and Retreat Center on April 8, 2008.)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:52.280
 "And along with Bodhichitta, then, of course, again, this is something that is important

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.360
 to think about in permanent joy and appreciation and kind of like igniting those qualities.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.400
 It's not something that we're making up these things.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.760
 It's truly we have all those things, joy and beautiful situations and circumstances.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 Bring all this goodness, qualities.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.760
 That is what practice itself.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 Practice is not practicing of all the witness of the ego, cling, this and that.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 Practice means goodness, qualities of the natures.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 Bring joy, appreciation, and kind of like, and respect and appreciation and happiness

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 at the same time.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.400
 And also in permanent, in all these situation, kind of looking exactly where things are,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.320
 not just ignoring, not just covering up that.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.680
 That all make mind some more kind of settle, mind more gentle, mind more kind of like down

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.040
 to the earth.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.520
 And then we can, again, make everything but more practical, more kind of simple.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 And also thinking of those things, immediately knocking the ego clingings.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.640
 Ego clingings are so kind of like regiment and consumption.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.040
 It's also one way ego clingings is very, very stubborn and all that.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 When you look into the nature where the really true is, then that really will also soften

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.100
 our egos and kind of like grasping and clinging and all that.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.400
 So it naturally help us to bring our goodness, qualities and all those are very, very kind

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 of important.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:38.480
