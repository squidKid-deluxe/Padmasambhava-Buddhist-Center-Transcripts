NOTE     "synopsis": "Brief Teaching on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nby Lama Pema Dragpa\n\nMarch 30, 2024\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n--\n\nThis is a quick, incomplete list of simple reminders that have helped me over time, and still do. Feel free to use what\u2019s helpful and leave the rest aside. - dragpa\n\n\u00b7 Different things help different people. One size doesn\u2019t fit all.\n\n\u00b7 Everyone has advice to give. Be discerning.\n\n\u00b7 Motivation is key. Mind matters most.\n\n\u00b7 We have to take personal responsibility. (Because mind matters most.)\n\u201cHow can I help others?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 It all comes down to bodhichitta.\nIn every context, bodhichitta is always enhancing.\n\n\u00b7 Whatever we do regularly becomes easier to do, whether it\u2019s thinking, feeling, or acting.\nThat\u2019s how habits work.\n\n\u00b7 A regular rhythm of meditation becomes easier to do.\n\n\u00b7 Tonglen Sending-and-Receiving practice is simple, easy to practice anywhere, and uses the body, speech, and mind with big results.\n\n\u00b7 Try to see the buddha-nature in others first.\nTry to see it in yourself as well.\n\n\u00b7 We\u2019re all just trying to be happy and avoid suffering.\nThat\u2019s our common ground.\n\n\u00b7 Poor people have poor people problems.\nRich people have rich people problems.\nSingle people have single people problems.\nMarried people have married people problems.\n\n\u00b7 The grass is always greener.\n\n\u00b7 \u201cThere will never be a time when everything is finished the way you want it.\nIt is like pursuing a mirage for water.\u201d -Vimalamitra\n\n\u00b7 Spend time learning what\u2019s really important to you.\n\n\u00b7 Make ongoing efforts to care for friendships and health.\nLife is often easier in good company, especially when you\u2019re not sick.\n\n\u00b7 Make an effort to show up at funerals.\nRegardless of what happens after death, family continues.\n\n\u00b7 Celebrate others\u2019 happiness and good qualities.\n\n\u00b7 Younger people are the leading edge of evolution.\nThey haven\u2019t yet assumed as fixed a worldview.\nTherefore they don\u2019t yet have to break out of as many worldview boxes that might not be that helpful for them.\n\n\u00b7 Humility means you\u2019re paying attention.\nWe\u2019re all a part of much larger stories.\n\n\u00b7 You don\u2019t have to reinvent every wheel.\nBe selective and save yourself some time.\n\n\u00b7 No one automatically becomes an \u201celder\u201d just by growing older or having grandkids.\nWisdom and compassion have to be consciously cultivated and opened into.\n\n\u00b7 Once we agree to play a certain game, we have to follow the rules in good faith. This makes us trustworthy. Later when we change games, the rules will change. Rules are arbitrary but required between people, otherwise there is no foundation for trust.\n\n\u00b7 Find trustworthy friends.\n\n\u00b7 Approaching others in good faith is key.\nAssume buddha-nature first, and, remember we all have bad habits.\n\n\u00b7 Habits are \u201cbad\u201d in terms of how they cover up our buddha-nature.\n\n\u00b7 Once we agree to play a particular game, there is a spectrum of truth.\nBetter and worse. In bounds and out of bounds. Fair and unfair. More points and less points.\nBut the spectrum is always determined by the rules, and the rules are always arbitrary.\n\n\u00b7 Buddhist views and vehicles work the same way.\nRelative truth is contextually true. Absolute truth is the open nature of all contexts.\n\n\u00b7 Everything is contextual, but having too many options often leads to extreme relativism. (\u201cThere is no truth.\u201d)\n\n\u00b7 Buddhists point towards absolute truth: what is unchanging or not dependent on causes and conditions. Absolute truth is not a thing, but a way of being.\n\n\u00b7 Absolute truth is always embedded within relative context, or a world, cosmology, story, ecology, or body.\n\n\u00b7 How to elegantly be with and move between worlds is living the view of the Middle Way.\n\n\u00b7 Going deep into a handful of interests is practical. We have to root ourselves somewhere.\nLoyalty and commitment make a big difference with learning and growing.\n\n\u00b7 All outer and inner worlds are fractally interlinked. Find reliable links or connections.\n\n\u00b7 Discovering connections between worlds helps us tap into and resonate with the power of many worlds simultaneously, even if we only learn a handful of them really well. Each wave connects us to the entire ocean.\n\n\u00b7 You don\u2019t have to know everything.\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything.\nBe selective without being narrow-minded.\n\n\u00b7 Hold yourself accountable.\nAllow yourself to be held.\n\n\u00b7 Be open-minded, but don\u2019t let your brain fall out.\n\n\u00b7 Learning essential points saves a lot of time.\nThese are called heuristics: rules of thumb.\nIn Buddhism, they\u2019re called \u201cmind trainings\u201d or \u201cpith instructions.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Following pith instructions helps keep it simple and deep.\nMore fully unpacking and resonating with pith instructions requires ongoing study, embodiment, and time.\n\n\u00b7 We didn\u2019t start this and we\u2019re not going to finish it.\n\n\u00b7 The way of the bodhisattva  means \u201cThere is no finish line.\u201d\nThere is no race either. The path is the goal. Emphasize process and quality. ...\n\nContinue reading complete list here:\nhttps://medium.com/@pema.dragpa/practical-advice-for-younger-dharma-practitioners-bb53ff74efaf",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 Thank you, Dharma sisters and brothers, and warm greetings. As we do, as the great lineage

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.780
 masters have pointed out to us time and again, always we begin with re-activating our view.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:34.720
 We do that in the three ways, with renunciation, bodhichitta, and pure perception. So, renunciation

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 or joy and appreciation is gratitude, all the loveliness that's happening inside of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.240
 us, outside of us, around us, all around. Let's generate that close, warm-hearted connective

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:57.200
 feeling and embodied, living presence. "Oh, I'm so much to be thankful for." Living Dharma,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.920
 living lineage masters, this health, my health, my ability to be aware, to be together, to

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 bring up this gratitude. And then bodhichitta, the heart-mind of enlightenment. We're trying

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.480
 to take all these little precious moments we have together and have them be oriented so

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.560
 that they become like the perfect conditions for all beings everywhere to totally have

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.900
 lasting happiness. Happiness right now, happiness in the long, long, long term, and then completely

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.160
 eradicate the causes of suffering. So, to achieve full awakening or enlightenment, then

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.400
 this bodhichitta, this kind of lived, very kind of like, really feel it, feel the kind

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.440
 of warm-hearted connectiveness, like really the connection, the like, really, "May all

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.480
 beings be free of suffering. May they be free of the causes of suffering. May they have

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.840
 happiness. May they have the causes of happiness. I rejoice whenever they feel happy. And I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.800
 try to want every being to feel this way, to be happy and free of all suffering." Then,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.320
 in addition, this pure perception, then we kind of relax and recognize this kind of,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.040
 this natural system is already doing what it does. It's already natural. It's already

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.200
 flowing. This goodness is already inside of each of us. It's the very ways that we're

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.000
 kind of always connecting with each other, that we're like co-creating this reality together.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 It's all bodhichitta. It's all this Buddha nature. It's all this goodness inside of us,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 in between us, around us, then really kind of just confidently like turning that kind

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.560
 of a vision on, that view that like really kind of relaxes into this goodness nature

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.080
 that's just the natural kind of state or condition of like all things as they already are, this

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:09.200
 kind of pure perception. We turn all three of those on. So the topic for today that I

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.560
 kind of just thought about is advice for younger Dharma practitioners. It's advice for younger

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 Dharma

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 practitioners, and over the past couple days I just kind of reflected on this and kind of came up

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.160
 with

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.450
 some thoughts, and so it's a bit of an unusual or not so ordinary kind of format for me. I just

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.760
 kind

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.400
 of wrote down like little bullet points, and I thought to go through and just kind of read them,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.720
 like little kind of bite-sized things that have really been helpful for me, and they still are

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.480
 on the path, and it's just helpful for me. So if it's not helpful for you, it's fine, you know,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.000
 do like whatever helps like use it, and so I just thought to like really quickly go through kind of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 a list of different like kind of things that have really helped me, and so in one way this is like

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.040
 kind of like reflecting on like you know what's been helpful for me, and then just to kind of share

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.260
 that, and then specifically for a little bit younger people, younger than me, and the people

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.760
 who are already kind of interested in Dharma, teachings of the Buddha, or teachings of Guru

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.920
 Rinpoche, and so it's kind of that's the where this is orienting towards this time. So it's kind of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.440
 a little more casual, and I'll read these points, and then give very short kind of like quick

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.320
 reflections on them, and just kind of go through and like see if anything lands for you, for me,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.680
 like see what it opens up. And so this first, you know, and no specific order, it's not a complete

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 list, okay? So one thing is a different things, oh and I'll share this list later in some kind of

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.060
 YouTube thing, or so you can see it, don't have to worry about it if you're interested in getting

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.240
 the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.000
 list later. Um, different things help different people. One size doesn't fit all. So that's just

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.960
 the point of like kind of I need to find out what helps me. What actually helps me bring out my

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.120
 bodhicitta, bring my warm-hearted connection to others, like and turn my intelligence on my

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.680
 creativity. Like what does that? What is really helpful? So it's really kind of orient and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.280
 emphasize

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.240
 like what actually helps me, and like then because it helps me, it doesn't necessarily help

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.520
 everyone,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.400
 so to kind of hold it like a little lightly. But really like of all the things I can choose from,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.080
 of all the places and people and interests, like to really put extra kind of emphasis on like well,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.480
 what is helpful for me to bring out this goodness? And then just because it helps me doesn't mean

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.400
 it helps other people. Like different things help different people. A second point, is it just

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.640
 quick?

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:53.480
 Everyone has advice to give. Be discerning. We all have wisdom to share actually. We all have

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.840
 different insights. So kind of it's an endless array of different things that we can learn from.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.800
 So we have to be really discerning. Time is limited. Our interests, our talents, are kind of

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 the ways that we kind of get stuck. They're all very specific to each person, each being.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.520
 So like just you know, as I'm giving some advice, whatever that means, like I just say that with a

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.240
 grain of salt, you know, like everyone has some advice, some insight, something that's helped them.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.680
 But each of us has to be discerning about whether it's advice or insight or something that's

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.080
 actually

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.040
 kind of resonates with me and helps me. You know, just because someone has advice to give doesn't

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.520
 mean we have to actually, you know, apply it ourselves. It might not be that helpful for us.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:48.920
 Again, kind of third, motivation is key. The Buddha so emphasized this in all of his teachings.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:59.160
 Mind matters most. Motivation sometimes talked about as a view. And with this point, it kind of

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.640
 automatically kind of leads us to kind of have this kind of a little bit more of a direct taste

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.720
 that like we each of us have to take kind of some degree of personal responsibility for our life.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.870
 If mind matters most, my mind, my awareness right now, if my motivation and my view is the

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.240
 principle,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.560
 the bedrock element or aspect that's going to define all the other things that happen to me,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:34.840
 then it's my mind. It's my awareness. And so because it's my awareness, my attention, my mind,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.520
 then it's up to me to try to be mindful, heartful, and discerning where I put my attention,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.080
 how I open my heart when I like kind of like, you know, and more protective and like caring for

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.930
 something. Maybe I don't want to open to something that's kind of not going to be so helpful for me

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.240
.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:00.200
 So mind does matter most according to the Buddha's teachings, which actually means that we have to

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.730
 tame our own mind. It's up to us and it doesn't have to be so much of a metaphor of taming the mind

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.200
.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.280
 It can also be a metaphor of opening the mind or a metaphor of relaxing the mind. In here,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:19.160
 mind always means heart-mind, always together, wisdom and compassion, always together. And so

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.640
 then the natural question isn't what, you know, if something's kind of wrong in the world or

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.960
 something

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.720
 I don't like seems wrong to me, then kind of what can I do? But how am I going to engage this? And

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.760
 then why is that helpful in the larger context of the world? It's because if I am with my mind and

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:43.560
 my awareness and I learn to kind of like see kind of with discernment, what's helpful for me? Where

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.160
 do I fit in? How can I make an offering of my talents or my kind of specific kind of things I

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.360
 could share? Then it's always oriented within this larger kind of scope of like, how can I help

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.560
 others? How can I really serve others? How can I be with others in ways that are helpful to them?

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.720
 And so we have these two sides of my mind matters most in order that I could be more helpful.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:16.440
 It's not just my mind matters most, so I can just be happy by myself. It's more, I want to be happy

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:16.440
,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.720
 but my mind, I have to come down to my mind and my heart, open them, relax them into their own

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.760
 natural goodness. Why? Because everyone has this goodness. And then what helps them?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.080
 And here it leads to this, in Buddha's teaching it's become more and more clear for me

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:42.040
 that it all comes down to bodhicitta, this heart mind of enlightenment. All the teachings come

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:49.160
 down to this point of bodhicitta, the heart mind of enlightenment. And bodhicitta is so amazing.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:56.840
 It's one of the things that's incredible that in every single situation and in every context,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:07.000
 bodhicitta enhances it. Bodhicitta is only helpful because bodhicitta is always shaped by the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.720
 living

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.240
 world, by the living context. It always depends on what's happening around with how bodhicitta

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:20.760
 shows up. And that's just a beautiful quality of bodhicitta. It's flexible, absolute nature.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.800
 That bodhicitta is totally informed. It's responsive to the living situation that I'm in,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.680
 of my mind, of who I'm with, of what's active in the situation, what's the time, what's the place,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.320
 what actually serves beings. Bodhicitta shapes itself according to what actually helps beings,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.960
 according to my own capabilities of understanding that, of seeing that. Which is a beautiful thing

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.040
 in that way. Every time I activate bodhicitta, because it's going to be shaped or defined,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.120
 colored, flavored by the living conditions, it's going to only boost or enhance those living

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.960
 conditions because it's actually shaped by the living conditions. This is such an extraordinary

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.200
 quality. And we can look at this through all the Jnana vehicle teachings of the Buddha,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.760
 like the different ways that he talked about the Buddha, great historical Buddha, talked about

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.560
 wisdom and compassion. Coming down to in Mahayana teachings is bodhicitta, heart, mind of

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.520
 enlightenment.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.680
 We can really look clearly through the vehicle teachings, all the different philosophical

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:26.360
 schools and unpack and open bodhicitta further and further, deeper, wider, more vast, more profound

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:26.360
.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.920
 And it just keeps going. So at this point, it all comes down to bodhicitta. I think that's quite

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.560
 true

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.360
 in the teachings from what I found, from what Venerable Kambharambhich has emphasized,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.320
 that it all comes down to bodhicitta. So we always need to highlight that at the front,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.400
 which they remind us again and again. This is the main point, bodhicitta.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.080
 Another point that Shantadeva emphasized is whatever we do regularly becomes easier to do,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:07.960
 whether it's thinking, feeling or acting. It's just how habits work. So we have to be careful

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:15.000
 what habits we grow. Because every single moment we're growing a habit, we're making a thought

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.560
 easier to have, a feeling easier to feel, an action easier to do. And so then depending on

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.200
 positive or negative, with how much it's going to actually help my bodhicitta, my bodhicitta,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.720
 turn on or be naturally available, then that's a positive habit for me. And so we just have to be

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.920
 really careful that whatever we actually put our time and energy into, that's actually what gets

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.120
 strong and easy for us to do. So we should be really careful about what habits we cultivate.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.440
 The mind is totally flexible in that way. The habits are totally flexible. It depends on how

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.800
 we shape them, with how they'll become more normalized. And in this regard, that means also

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:05.480
 that having a regular rhythm of meditation makes it easier to do. Our bodies tend to like rhythms.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.160
 Our minds follow these habit patterns, that if we want to have meditation like a time set aside for

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.560
 ourselves, where we can just be actively in touch with our heart and our mind, we're trying to open

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.720
 and kind of discern and see, open and relax these qualities of love, compassion, wisdom. The four

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.680
 boundless qualities, infinite love, infinite compassion, infinite sympathetic rejoicing,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.080
 this joy, infinite equanimity, including all beings, that if we want to set aside some time

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.880
 for that, it'll be five minutes, 10 minutes, longer, an hour, two hours, depends. But having a

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.440
 regular

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.040
 set kind of rhythm with that makes it easier to do because each habit, the more we do it, it

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.440
 becomes

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:55.480
 easier, more natural for us. I mean, in terms of bodhicitta, the practice of tonglen, sending and

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:01.720
 receiving, it's such an inspiring, amazing practice that I found. It's like said to be a heart

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.200
 practice

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.730
 of a bodhicapa, those courageous for the enlightenment of all beings. Tonglen, the practice of

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:08.120
 giving

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.640
 our own happiness to others and taking their suffering upon ourselves. I'm not going to go

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.960
 into how to practice that. There's many, many teachings by extraordinary wisdom beings that

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.520
 you can get online. This is for free, this instructions on how to practice tonglen.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.680
 But it's so easy to do. It's so simple to do. We can do it any time. We can do it quietly. No one

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:34.280
 has to know we're doing it. And it uses all of our body, our speech and our mind all at the same

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.600
 time.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.480
 And so in these ways, tonglen is such a special practice. It really activates our bodhicitta,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.440
 activates our courageous dignity, kind of like the clarity of our wisdom, the openness and kind

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.120
 of like a vital energy of our heart and the kind of deep rooted dignity of our courage, of our

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.360
 power,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.240
 of our skillful means. Tonglen, I'm going to take on this suffering onto myself because my Buddha

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:06.840
 nature is totally perfectly pure and this suffering just even brightens my Buddha nature, makes it

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.520
 connect with even more beings. And then on the out breath, I give all my happiness, all the

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:12.920
 supportive

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.680
 conditions that could help uplift beings, whatever it is, heal them, protect them, free them, upl

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.920
ift

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:24.120
 them, nourish them, care for them, anything that would help a being. Then on the out breath,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.000
 kind of like instantly this energy becomes exactly what each being needs, instantly. And they're so

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.440
 happy, they're so relieved, they're so joyful. And then on the in breath, I take the suffering

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:36.760
 again,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.440
 it becomes this energy fuel power for my own bodhicitta to shine on more brightly.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:49.080
 On the out breath, they feel uplifted, more powerful, more relaxed, more natural, more creative.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.720
 In breath, out breath, this practice of Tonglen is such a good essential practice. It's the heart

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.120
 of

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.050
 the kind of way of the bodhisattva and it's also the heart of Vajrayana Tibetan Buddhism, bodhic

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.880
itta.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:10.200
 Another point that I found super helpful for myself is if I can just try to see the Buddha

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:18.280
 nature in others first. If I kind of train my mind to think of Buddha nature of others first,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.640
 instead of what's wrong, or what they say that I don't like, what's going on in the world that

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.680
 I'm uncomfortable with, that I don't agree with, instead of that, like highlight the Buddha nature

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.600
 aspect first. And this puts kind of the bodhicitta at the front. And then this makes it so much

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.000
 easier

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.200
 the step for us to kind of relax into pure perception, this view of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.040
 where we're seeing the Buddha nature in all beings all the time, and it's glowing more

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.640
 brightly and a much kind of greater arrays of kind of like expressions. It's like endless display

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:53.880
 of

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.840
 pure ways that Buddha nature can shine. And so just like training myself, I'll see the Buddha

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:05.640
 nature first in others and in myself, kind of have that as something I keep coming back to.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.960
 The Buddha nature of others first, then it's so much easier to love others,

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:17.160
 care for them, because you know, they're so valuable. Each being is so amazingly special,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.800
 like literally have enlightened nature. And I try to kind of connect with that

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.880
 enlightened nature first before my own reactive patterns turn on and take over.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:33.240
 And I do that for myself too. I have this Buddha nature, this goodness. It's perfect. It's always

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.400
 there. And I try to really kind of be with that as kind of more first thought, the first way of

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:47.960
 engaging a situation. This immediately reorients kind of a reframes life, see the Buddha nature

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.880
 and others in oneself first. And then we're looking in the world, this another point is really all

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.040
 of

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:06.920
 us, we're just trying to be happy and avoid suffering. We all are. No matter our age, our

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:14.120
 reputation, our job, our situation, all these things are just kind of superficial features

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:21.240
 in regard and like compared with every single moment. We're just trying to not suffer and we

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.640
 want to be happy. This is really a common ground for all sentient beings. We all want to be happy.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:34.520
 No one wants to suffer. Then if we put this like more at the front of our attention,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.440
 all this being out there causing trouble, they're just so unhappy. They're causing so much

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:40.920
 suffering.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.490
 They don't want to cause suffering, but they don't know how to be happy. Instead, they're just

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:45.880
 causing

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:51.240
 so much trouble for everyone. Instead of seeing them as beings automatically bad, we want to

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.800
 throw them away. Oh, this is really like they're really hurt. And it goes to that kind of common

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:06.680
 saying that hurt people hurt people. We are hurt and that's why we hurt others. Instead, if we're

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:13.160
 like, oh, we all are hurting. What can I do to really kind of care for others better? And with

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:19.480
 wisdom, to distinguish different things help different people. Okay, you're hurting and you

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.240
 have so many beautiful things to offer. Okay, this is common ground. We can look for the valuable

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.920
 aspect of the valuable kind of contributions each of which I'm making all the time. Start there

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.080
 with

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.920
 the Buddha nature and with the like the little lovely little delightful things that each person

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.680
 is doing. Everyone has so much they're sharing all the time. So really highlight kind of the

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.720
 special qualities first with the recognition of we're all just kind of like winging this thing.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.400
 Why? We don't want to suffer. We want to be happy. Venerable Kemperumice is said different times

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:03.720
 teaching from the Buddha. Poor people have poor people problems. Rich people have rich people

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.560
 problems. Single people have single people problems. Married people, partnered people,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.880
 married people have married people problems. Like it's just some sorrow like that. There's

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.960
 not a spot in some sorrow that's not suffering, which isn't why to say that that's the end of the

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.280
 story. That's just the first noble truth the Buddha taught. It's their suffering. Every situation

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:28.520
 is

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.880
 always fragile. Even if it's good for a bit, then it changes and kind of loses that kind of

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.200
 goodness

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:43.560
 it had. Things are constantly moving interdependent. And so like to kind of like release that idea

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.480
 that there's some spot in some sorrow that's actually perfect. The Buddha said this is not true.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:57.720
 Every spot in some sorrow, every time we have duality mind, that unrealistically grasps onto

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.240
 kind of a moving flow, tries to freeze it and lock it in place. Anytime we do that,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:11.080
 this grasping mind, duality mind, always is going to be suffering. And so that's kind of like this

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.160
 bedrock understanding in buddhism. We need to release the grasping.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:23.720
 Kempo Sanramicce said to me once, like straight directly to me, the grass is always greener.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:29.640
 Even if there's not a space in some sorrow that's perfect,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.600
 we'll always think well maybe that place is better. This is also an endless game.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.120
 Always going to be something better, always going to be someone smarter, always going to be

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.440
 something

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:48.680
 more lovely, more interesting. It's always going to be some better. Grass is always greener. And

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.640
 oftentimes we're only highlighting part that we like of a situation we're not in, and we're not

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.480
 seeing the full picture of what it is. So the lived experience of something is quite different than

00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.720
 like

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.800
 little being with it for five minutes, you know. Being in an actual ongoing relationship is quite

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:12.120
 different than a honeymoon period of a relationship. They both have their place, but actually

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.520
 living in

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.160
 relationship with the world, with others, with ourselves, is quite involved, and it's much more

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:23.240
 multifaceted, much more layered, much more lovely and well-rounded than just kind of seeing

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.640
 something

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.640
 at a distance. Oh, this is maybe the grass is greener over there. Then oftentimes we can like

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.280
 kind of unintelligently give up all these amazingly good things we already have right in our lap.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.200
 Thinking that there's some better place over there that doesn't have any problems.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:50.120
 The great master, Vimala Mitra, once said a line in this chesaninte. Vimala Mitra said,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.880
 "There will never be a time when everything is finished the way you want it.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:01.240
 It is like pursuing a mirage for water. There will never be a time when everything is finished the

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.720
 way you want it. It is like pursuing a mirage for water." I once asked a question publicly in this

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:16.760
 room. I forget the question I asked, but that was the answer he gave me. There will never be a time

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.280
 when everything is finished the way you want it. It is like pursuing a mirage for water. Don't wait

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:27.800
 for everything to be perfect and get exactly the way I want it. Before I do things like a dharma

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.560
 practice or generate bhorichitta or have a kindness towards others or kind of stop and like watch

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:33.720
 my

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.400
 mind for a few minutes. Don't try to get everything in perfect position and then I'll do the thing

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.760
 that's my highest priority because it's not ever going to be together in a perfect way the way we

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.840
 want it. It literally just never happens in samsara like that. That's been really helpful for me to

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.160
 remember. There's a lot of ways I can waste my own time trying to make things all kind of with

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:03.640
 an arrangement that's proper perfect. Trying to make a nice setting a nice arrangement kind of like

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:10.360
 good enough is quite different than perfect. And so that's also related to contentment. Sometimes

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:17.480
 good enough is just good enough. Be content with what we have and then hold the main point close.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.320
 bhorichitta activating or bhorichitta showing up for other beings loving them fully.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:31.400
 So this goes to another point same thing. Spend time learning about what's really important to me.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.120
 Like really spend extra time and energy. If there's something I'm really passionate about

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.680
 that's really important to me like put extra time in that. Don't just put it off in some bucket

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:42.920
 list

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.040
 you might get to one of these days but really put the thing that's really the high priority that's

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.150
 like really special to me like try to keep it right in the front. This is a good dharma practice

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:54.600
 too.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.480
 Make ongoing efforts to care for friendships and one's health.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.800
 Life is often easier in good company when you're not sick.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:14.200
 Friendships and good health they're really very very special.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:23.640
 Friendships having good friends good company that's such a it's such a valuable and like really

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.840
 amazing thing. This sangha and good health it's just so much easier when we have good health

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:33.400
 like use our mind and use our body like to the purpose that we want to use it for for dharma.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.760
 You know for love, compassion, wisdom. Use it while it's easier when we're not sick.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:46.280
 Kind of a related note make an effort to show up at funerals.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:53.320
 It makes a really big difference to all everyone left behind. All the beings are still alive.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.420
 You know funerals are one of those big significant events in everyone's life and in the lives of

00:25:59.420 --> 00:25:59.720
 the

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.000
 person who's died and the lives of those who are around them. Try to really make an effort. This

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.040
 makes a really big difference. I see this more and more as I grow a little older. Another point

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.800
 celebrate others happiness and their good qualities. Really just celebrate others like

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 highlight the good qualities and just kind of love on them you know. Like there's just so much

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.320
 beauty

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.760
 in the world. Everyone has so many amazing qualities like really highlight those and celebrate them

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:28.760
.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:35.240
 Like let them know you know. It's really good. It helps and kind of creates a positive feedback

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.800
 loop for people to be encouraged you know for their talent they feel seen and you're seeing

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.440
 them. It's lovely to see others like their goodness and then the goodness kind of shines brighter.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:51.000
 Another point um younger people I think are on the leading edge of evolution.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.960
 Largely because they're just younger. They're not yet for the most part usually younger people with

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.360
 less time being alive. They just haven't been as set in their ways. They're not as locked into

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.680
 a certain worldview yet. And so as time kind of moves on and there's more things emerging.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:14.680
 There's more kind of relationship in the universe just because time and space like there's more of

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.960
 a fullness happening than the younger people haven't yet been set into a specific pattern.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:26.600
 And so they're literally like kind of the result of what's current plus. And so there's a big

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.600
 opportunity there that as we're younger not yet set in our views not yet as ad set in certain

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.000
 habits.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.280
 Then we don't have to like do all the extra work of trying to undo bad habits or unbox certain

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:47.320
 views that aren't so helpful for us. Given like Mahayana view we've been born countless times

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.960
 endless. But in this life in this fresher body that this kind of how it works with this fresh

00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:01.000
 body this time around there's certain habits that haven't yet locked in as strongly when our body's

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.720
 younger. And so it's kind of in one way a little easier to take on kind of views that haven't yet

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:19.640
 been trained in us or entrained in us. At the same time point about humility. Humility basically

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:19.960
 means

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:27.240
 we're just paying attention because each of us is always a part of a larger story many stories

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.680
 actually. Humility just is like wow I'm really a part of like I'm standing on the shoulders always

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.040
 like I'm depending on others always. I'm always kind of like enjoying the wealth of all the work

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.400
 and efforts and insights innovations like kind of the beauty and the things that like the beings

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:43.880
 have

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:50.440
 kind of sustained and preserved for so long now. Humility is just seeing that clearly wow and then

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.840
 naturally I'll be grateful. Look at all these things I get to enjoy I didn't have to figure out.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:02.040
 Just oh wow like take a kind of like a humble grateful position. And this really just means

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.560
 I'm actually paying attention to cause condition and effect. It's not some you know devout virtuous

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.120
 kind of like way like a certain religious thing. It just means I'm really paying attention to

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:17.880
 relationships. Wow it's amazing all the things that I've just immediately come into and I'm

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:25.800
 boosted by because of all the hard effort of so many other beings. Wow thank you. I mean really

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:37.480
 thank you so much. Um you don't have to reinvent every wheel. Be selective save yourself some time.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.680
 We don't have to do everything from scratch.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:48.440
 It's like be discerning. Like what do I want to use that you know I we have to in the end for

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:54.280
 Buddhists see everything for ourself. But some things we just can't. We don't have time. Do I

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.660
 need to see an atom for myself. Am I going to learn to actually test that myself. Let's say it

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.000
 takes a

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.640
 life. So some things we just have to you know be real clear. What do I really want to go really

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:13.240
 thoroughly see for myself and what else am I going to have in good faith. We don't have to reinvent

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:19.640
 everything for ourselves. Some things that's great but everything is not really a realistic

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.360
 possibility.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.000
 One point that sometimes can be hard to hear but it's I don't know depends it's very kind of like

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.960
 real too. No one automatically becomes an elder just by growing older or having grandkids.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:42.440
 This is to the Buddhist point of wisdom and compassion have to be consciously cultivated

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:48.920
 and grown or opened into. Wisdom doesn't just you know magically turn on for some beings and not

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:55.960
 for others. We actually have to consciously engage a practice or a process a path of actually

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.920
 kind of opening into our wisdom and into our compassion. It doesn't just automatically happen

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.720
 as time happens. Like we've been around again Mahayana Buddhism for countless lives. We don't

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.600
 automatically just become enlightened. The Buddha really taught that no one accidentally becomes

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.440
 enlightened. It doesn't happen magically like that in the sense of it's just some people get

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.160
 to wake up and others don't just because they had good luck or something like that. No wisdom is

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:31.320
 always intentionally cultivated and so like just it's good to see you know just because we're

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.680
 getting older doesn't mean we're getting wiser or more compassionate or more kind. So we actually

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.040
 if we're curious or like care about becoming wiser and more compassionate we have to cultivate that

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.080
 in ourselves. We have to follow some kind of path that really cares about wisdom and compassion and

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:58.120
 we have to put time and energy into that path. Another point is once we agree to play a certain

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:06.840
 game a certain language have a certain kind of conversation. Once we agree to play a certain game

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:15.080
 we have to follow the rules of that game in good faith. This makes us trustworthy. Later when we

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:22.920
 change games the rules change. Rules are not arbitrary sorry rules are arbitrary but they're

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.960
 required between people. Otherwise there's no foundation for trust. So this is to say you know

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:37.880
 everything is like a dream but dreams all always follow rules or patterns. It's like a game. Games

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.260
 are totally arbitrary but once we agree to play a game like tennis then all of a sudden

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.600
 automatically

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.760
 there's certain rules turn on like inbounds out of bounds cheating playing fair who wins who loses

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:55.960
 and then once the tennis game's over then the rules dissolve. We play another game soccer we

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.400
 play another game the buddhist game we play another game the you know be a parent game like

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:07.960
 all these are just dreams patterns rules systems that we're in and the rules and the patterns are

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.760
 somewhat arbitrary. They can go this way or that way but when we're playing a game with other

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.400
 people

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:19.080
 and there's other people and we agree to the rules of that game we can't change the rules

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.160
 mid game. That's called bad faith and people stop trusting us. In buddhist in terms of debate

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.560
 you lose automatically if you change the rules mid debate. You can't change the topic of the debate

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:37.240
 mid mid debate. You can't say let's talk about relative truth and mid debate you'd start using

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.120
 all this absolute kind of view. Then you automatically forfeit the debate if you do that.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.960
 It causes bad faith. People can't trust if you just change the rules mid game their rules their

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.280
 arbitrary but once we do agree to them in a certain context in a certain game in a certain

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.040
 relationship then we have to show up on our side of the agreement. That just makes us a trustworthy

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:06.600
 person and then to that point find trustworthy friends. There's a buddhist saying of like even

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.480
 if you're kind of a regular tree in the middle of a sandalwood forest over time you start to

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.800
 smell like sandalwood too. Find good company good friends people that bring out your virtuous

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:31.320
 qualities like bodhicitta. It really helps on the path. We all have habits and habits they're only

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.280
 bad or good in terms of how much they cover up our buddha nature. A good habit is something

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.920
 that opens and reveals our buddha nature. A bad habit is something that kind of closes our buddha

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:47.080
 nature or covers it up and different things do that for different people. So we have to recognize

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.320
 for ourselves what's a good habit that helps me connect to my buddha nature. What's a bad habit

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.680
 that closes that up closes that connection or dims that brightness and just have to be kind of

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:56.920
 honest

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.040
 with myself about that. But it's not that my bad habits or everyone's bad habits or my good habits

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.080
 or everyone's good habits. Different things help buddha nature turn on and off in different beings.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:20.680
 Kind of a little bit more of a philosophical sequence here is that everything is contextual

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.360
 like a game or a dream but having too many games to choose from too many options

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:33.720
 usually leads to extreme relativism like there's no truth you know there's just endless options

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:39.800
 there's endless rules call it sliding signifiers this is endless endless ways things can be

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.160
 and while it's true that everything is context dependent or everything's contextual

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:54.200
 then the bodhisattva view says that everything's contextual but what is this context what is this

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.240
 game i'm playing what is this system i'm a part of what is this lineage i'm part of what is this

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:05.960
 uh job that i'm in the context defines a lot of the rules are kind of like the ways that something

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.520
 is and so that kind of lessens the infinite contextualism which also means we need to be

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.400
 discerning about what context we put ourselves in what relationships we want to be a part of what

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.360
 jobs do we want to have this all goes to the eightfold noble path of the buddha to try to take

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:26.040
 a kind of extra kind of carefulness or being full of care with how we use our body our speech in

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.200
 our

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:33.960
 mind um but it's not just that there's endless options in mayana buddhism specifically the

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:40.280
 nirvatriyana buddhism they also recognize there is such a thing as absolute truth there is an

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.480
 unchanging way that's not dependent on causes and conditions and this is more related to how we

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:53.240
 poise our mind absolute buddha nature or absolute bodhicitta it's not just endlessly sliding

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.360
 contexts

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.160
 there is actually an unchanging awareness that's called absolute truth in buddhism

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:05.160
 and then the next point in addition to that is absolute truth or that aspect of absolute

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:12.840
 buddha nature bodhicitta it always shows up in a body in a context in a world in relationality

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:21.000
 and so that absolute truth always has a relative expression it always relates to it always is in

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.920
 touch with so it always requires body always requires a world enactment practice being doing

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:38.680
 there's always relative and absolute truths they're always together and then how to move between

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.440
 these games these stories these dreams these relationships we're in how to move between them

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.640
 elegantly without causing too much trouble you know do no harm that's kind of very much comes

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.800
 down to living the view of the middle way the manyamaka great manyamaka this is absolute again

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:04.680
 absolute buddha nature or absolute bodhicitta emptiness all games are empty of any fixed rigid

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:11.560
 rules there's an awareness that is totally flexible and open that awareness always expresses itself

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:17.560
 in body embodied in worlds moving between the different worlds the different dreams the

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:23.160
 different relationships and contexts that happens when we have a more stable view of the middle way

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.880
 that a mind poised for awakening poised to be actively in touch with a living changing

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.200
 circumstances but not stuck onto it not grasping on to the moving dynamics of a living system

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:45.050
 whether it's my mind or my heart my body my speech or my mind so i'll say just a few more and there

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.160
's

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:51.000
 like i've generated many pages of this um just like yesterday a little bit i mean just did this

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.880
 really quickly actually um i'll say a few more than we'll practice dujum tersar nundro um

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:06.760
 going deep into a handful of interests is very practical in the end we really do have to root

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:13.560
 ourselves somewhere and that means loyalty and commitment make a big difference in terms of

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:20.520
 learning and growing if we stay put if we really stick around a spot long enough where the

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.160
 relationships of the spot are are in our kind of intuition with what happens there our ability to

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:33.400
 see a variety of patterns to see how the different seasonal shifts of a place of a lineage of a

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:33.640
 time

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:41.480
 of a relationship if we really choose to stay put in a spot we'll be able to appreciate more of the

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:47.000
 fullness or richness of that spot and so it's practical we can't if we just keep moving between

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.800
 places and kind of moving all the time moving our thoughts moving our body then we'll never

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.760
 really have that richness or fullness of kind of like actually the fullness of kind of each place

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:02.600
 that we're at there we're in so we need to be practical like life will do this to us anyway

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:09.640
 it'll hold us accountable to certain spots and so and that's lovely because it means we're being

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:15.560
 held we're actually a part of something we all want to belong we're always we all want to be

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:21.240
 a part of something greater than just me that's just a natural connection it's a natural urge

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.880
 a longing of buddha nature be with you know in relationship dependently arisen

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:32.040
 so we should be really clear about where do i want to go deep and then the thing is is wherever

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.840
 we go deep it automatically is connected with these other places that i'm at not immediately at

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.600
 it's all interdependence so we can actually use the kind of like the power the connection the

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.720
 interest the intelligence of these other places that were not at so much we actually because they

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.200
 sync up interdependence we can use them to inform us over time if we get really good at being in a

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.560
 spot in a way in a lineage in a practice we get really good at it it automatically syncs up with

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.040
 other things and we can use the intelligence and those connections between those things

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:10.680
 to actually boost ourselves that's kind of like in the ocean you get the whole energy of the ocean

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.600
 just by being in one spot of it by being in a wave it's like that interdependence is like that

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.600
 so it's more like being in a generative field and kind of like enriching a certain spot in the

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.400
 field

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.560
 and once we pacify it we enrich or nourish it then we can magnetize other fields to have a bigger

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:45.720
 field this is kind of part of like this mahayana buddhism practice so yeah there's really so many

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:50.920
 points i mean i have many many more points but in all all in all like kind of we'll just go into

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.120
 the due to interstart practice but kind of like advice for you know younger dharma practitioners

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.760
 it really does all come down to bodhicitta you have to see that for yourself look at it see if

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:07.240
 it's true or not and find reliable guides that will help you and like become a reliable person

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:13.320
 who like is there a trustworthy person like trustworthy like that's you know a reliable

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.240
 guide is going to like actually you know it's like an you know a student like in an educational

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.040
 process like be a good student and then like find a good teacher and then the learning the

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.280
 education happens so much more easily when we're both with a good teacher because we like really

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.280
 kind of carefully discern that we try to be a good student intelligent receptive humble interested

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:40.520
 honest kind of upfront work hard then have bodhicitta is the kind of core bedrock intention

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.880
 knowing that there's a variety of ways to live in the world there's so many different things we can

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:51.240
 do we have to kind of you know care for certain parts of it and not for others it is just a

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:57.560
 practical feature of sentient awareness time body mind we have to like go deep somewhere if we're

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.880
 going to do that and we can do that it's not a problem as long as we keep an open mind fresh

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.920
 perspective like i'm more of a mind and heart poised like in the middle way with the bodhicitta

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.450
 kind of like actively kind of sparkling alive like really trying to show up with kind of a careful

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:12.760
ness

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.720
 and like a sensitive like helpfulness a loving quality a warm-hearted quality to be with others

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.240
 also with like an intelligent mind open mind not a mind so open that our brain falls out

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:31.320
 but like open but very clear and precise you know not narrow and tight not open open so there

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:38.520
 were wishy-washy like open compassionate very clear and precise following patterns of cause

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.240
 condition and effect these are all just different things that are just core buddhist frameworks

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:48.760
 they're core buddhist insights that the buddhas so like generously taught all of us that the living

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.240
 wisdom masters we're around like venerable kenberimiches we can see this in our own eyes our own

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.640
 ears we can see how they're doing this they're living it these kind of core principles all the

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:04.920
 time and so amazing and in the end like as we go further in the path as we kind of get more relaxed

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.560
 more open as bodhicitta becomes more normal as we become just more natural and confident and okay

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.920
 with ourselves okay with each other this goodness is there then it naturally becomes more buoyant

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:20.120
 we have more fun more joy you know like more actual like feeling of being a part of something

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:25.320
 of connected we're resonating with things we're a part of this earth we're part of this larger

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.640
 story we're always a part of this larger thing so how can i help what can i do what really what do

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:38.760
 i love what am i passionate about who will help support that what are others passionate about that

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.880
 how can i support them we're doing this together it's kind of dream team how can we make this a

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:50.360
 better dream for more dream beings to get the dream result of freedom full freedom awakening

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:56.360
 that's the kind of burning question for bodhisattva and in the end there's no finish line

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:04.440
 the dream doesn't end just keeps going helping beings and they're all dream-like beings so we

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.200
 kind of lighten that kind of like tension around having to finish it we lighten the tension around

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:16.120
 it being one fixed thing we can kind of like let our energy kind of more flow we see the power of

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:23.720
 each moment there's so many worlds there's so many beings in every moment every moment matters it's

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.200
 always going to ripple throughout time and space forever so like really high quality moments love

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:36.200
 compassion wisdom do what we can see when we're getting stuck try to kindly kind of relax that

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:41.080
 forgive that ourselves like and also clearly kind of like have that kind of buoyancy of brightness

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:47.080
 of bodhich to come out and like start again it's another moment reconnect to dharma reconnect to

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:53.560
 our goodness reconnect to the goodness and others so thank you friends it's always kind of lovely

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:59.960
 to just kind of reflect on the dharma and reflect on it with you definitely from my own mind it's

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.920
 very helpful just to kind of be with the teachings for a little longer and then in addition to

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.560
 practice them so here we'll go into the dujum tarsar nandro practice revealed by his holiness

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:15.880
 dujum Rinpoche and we'll start with the prayer of calling the lama from afar so here we already

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.720
 recited seven line prayer and lineage prayers so we'll just recite seven line prayer once

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.160
 and then we'll go right into this calling the lama from afar by his holiness dujum Rinpoche

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.720
 so thanks so much very very much friends Tashulay really appreciate if you want to see these points

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.100
 all written out i'll put it in the youtube video at the bottom and there's many more points i didn

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:36.120
't

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.880
 get to just the limit of time so really genuinely thank you

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:50.280
 calling the lama from afar after the seven line prayer

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:11.160
 thank you thank you all thought to just take a few more minutes to mention just a few more

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:16.200
 kind of reflections that have really helped me a lot in terms of advice for kind of younger

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.240
 dharma practitioners this topic i was just going to read through a few quickly and then just for

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:31.400
 a few minutes so this is just continuing the thread from where we were following pith instructions

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:39.240
 helps keep things simple and deep but fully unpacking and resonating with those same pith

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:47.240
 instructions requires ongoing study and embodiment and time really takes time to open those pith

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:57.320
 instructions but using those pith instructions saves us a lot of time don't hurt yourself

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:08.040
 unnecessarily so be full of care or careful the healing really takes a lot of time so the world

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:14.600
 suffering samsara is suffering we're all going to get hurt so like just be really careful not to

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.560
 hurt yourself unnecessarily that also means like discernment there's a lot of things out in the

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:28.520
 world that are really harmful so like use your own wisdom and intelligence to kind of intelligently

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:35.960
 not let in certain things that are not worth it it's not worth getting hurt because really taking

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:44.360
 the time to heal it really is very involved this one person sean sb and hargens he had a statement

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:54.120
 that helped me take things seriously but with a light touch this is like helps me resonate with

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.160
 like staying with an open mind take things seriously like really consider something thoroughly

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:07.080
 like with a really open mind but hold it really lightly because maybe we don't know you know

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:14.280
 maybe it's true maybe not but to imaginatively consider other possibilities is a really helpful

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:20.840
 practice to orient towards emptiness towards the flexibility of our awareness take it seriously

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:26.520
 really consider it but hold it really really lightly it's in the end it's all just a dream

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:33.800
 anyway so it lines up with these poor mahayana practices thought to mention especially it seems

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:40.680
 like a lot of younger people that if you're feeling depressed this one bit of advice i heard

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:47.720
 this one teacher said um look around you and see if anyone needs any help and just help them a

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:54.840
 little bit if you really feel down like try to see someone else around and like connect with them

00:49:54.840 --> 00:50:00.920
 just offer a little bit of help it can really kind of open things up and then if you're really

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:06.680
 kind of feeling depressed anxious is in really kind of very kind of like profound way then it's

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.800
 very much worth it to seek professional help there's experts of all these different kinds of

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.180
 modalities including dharma modalities if we want to really go deep in the dharma find a really

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:16.200
 good

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.920
 dharma teacher but if we want to really if we hurt in a certain way we're having a really kind of

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:27.160
 very serious challenge that keeps coming up then find the expert of that field it's really worth

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:33.160
 your time your valuable especially every one of us is such an incredible amazing buddha in the

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:39.080
 making we all have buddha nature really need to honor this and if we can work with guidance of

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.200
 really qualified experts related to the specific thing we need help with it's very much worth it

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.680
 so kind of do yourself a favor and kind of care for your buddha nature that way

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:57.000
 uh a bit of advice folks our kin serum gave spend some time every day just being quiet with

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.400
 yourself

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:05.080
 and get to know your own heart and mind just have a little bit of at least a little bit of quiet

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.320
 time

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:11.320
 just with yourself every day and i recently heard from joseph goldstein he quoted one of his first

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:19.880
 dharma teachers monindra monindra g said if you want to understand your mind sit down and observe

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:29.080
 it if you want to understand your mind sit down and observe it it's so simple it's so lovely

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.240
 it's right here our mind

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:40.200
 separate one people i found people really live really really love to connect with others about

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:47.240
 what they love what they're interested in so like ask them what do you love and then really listen

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:54.520
 and pay attention with a lot of curiosity this is like a very easy way to kind of like get to

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.280
 know someone and to like really kind of be with them in a way that they're really kind of like

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:04.760
 passionately on fire you know oh what do you love and then really listen and really have genuine

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:12.200
 interest on kind of what they share this is like we all want to connect to know and then another

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.600
 way we connect is really through suffering suffering is a big doorway to dharma it's a big

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:24.840
 doorway to connect with each other we all suffer so kind of another joseph goldstein quotes that

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:31.160
 use your suffering wisely suffering can really help you understand you're not alone

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:38.120
 all these beings all of us are suffering i'm not the only one in this vulnerable spot of my

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.000
 suffering something that hurts it's something that's vulnerable and tender it actually is the

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.360
 kind of gateway the doorway into me connecting with others because i can't guard and defend that

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:53.960
 spot as easily i have to be open to some kind of responsiveness from the world this suffering is

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:59.240
 actually really a doorway to compassion caring for others their suffering and caring for ourselves

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:05.080
 like kind of our own dependence you know our own in like the ability to that we're vulnerable

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:12.490
 that we depend on this world that's a big powerful spot actually and then it's just a couple more

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.160
 we

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:20.040
 can't change something we're not aware of it's very difficult to change anything if we don't know

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.480
 it's there and so one of the practical things that all meditating traditions do is they they

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:34.360
 have a function of metacognition instead of for example thinking i am anger i think no i am like

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:43.480
 i am i am aware of anger so anger is not me i am aware of my thinking there are thinking's not me

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:49.000
 if we're aware of this kind of part that we before we thought it was me then we're just

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.720
 aware of it like oh experience of anger it's called metacognition all of a sudden we're aware

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.040
 of our anger we're aware of our thought and then our space and our perspective is bigger

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:04.200
 this is the general function of almost any every single meditation called metacognition

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.320
 and gradually we expand this and open this further and further to include more and more objects

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:09.560
 which

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:16.120
 means more and more relationality more and more cause condition and effect and then a final thing

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.080
 especially for the younger ones uh no one really knows what the world's going to be like in 20

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:27.000
 years like the bedrock basics are going to be the same four noble truths the basics are going to be

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.320
 the same but in terms of a lot of the outer kind of more superficial features of what will be kind

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:39.400
 of trending what will be a good job to have like really like unusual period of time we people

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:39.640
 really

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:49.560
 don't know 20 years out at this point it'll be very hard to predict this now thus having a

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.680
 flexible ability to be kind of adaptive to be intelligent in a variety of situations that

00:54:54.680 --> 00:55:00.120
 becomes a very helpful skill learn how to be flexible learn how to be broad and general and

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:08.680
 also really deep learn how to be like kind of very attentive but very fluid very general very

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:15.800
 specialized so this both and thinking so that's called a polarity optimize both sides of a polarity

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:23.480
 relative and absolute truth for example then this is kind of makes it kind of

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:29.800
 makes us very adaptive as things change and then just the final thing is always dedicate the merit

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.040
 any good thing you do it can be right after you do it dedicate the merit for the benefit of all

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.200
 beings or it could be a long time after you do it and you forgot to you could dedicate the merit

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.080
 of all my past lives like any good thing i ever did i dedicate that merit so that all beings are

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.600
 free right now or you can dedicate the merit of other buddhas in the past present and future and

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.520
 all the peacemakers in the past present and future that was a great extraordinary lines

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.160
 where we're teaching of the buddha to dedicate the merit for the benefit of all beings be free of

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:06.760
 suffering and have happiness and the causes of happiness so thank you friends thank you
