And then when we go into the higher teachings, bodhichitta is the Dzogchen practice. There is nothing else in the Dzogchen teaching aside from bodhichitta. ... Bodhichitta is enlightened mind, awakened mind, awakened nature, awakened energy of intelligence that is within ourselves - our heart center. Today with Dzogchen practice, we're waking this up. We're bringing this into the brilliant state, removing all the clouds, mists, and dust that prevent this beautiful nature.\"",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
 As the Buddha summoned the brother, again we will start with our virtual motivation.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.620
 And speaking about the motivations, generally there are three kinds of motivations.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.100
 When you look from the point of view of the Mahayanas teachings, there are three forms of this.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:31.000
 Those are known as the lesser motivations of the lesser motivations, mediocre motivations, and then

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 very higher motivations.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.800
 This is that when you look from the point of view of the Mahayanas schools.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.760
 What is a lesser motivation? It's a little of sentient beings basically, but also connected to the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 spiritual, to the Dharma.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.340
 And there is some serving people, that is a great master generally, as Buddha told, and a great

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 master Atisha highlighted that,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.560
 and as well as the great master Sastakkapa, and others are also highlighted that.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.050
 This is again from the point of view of the Mahayanas, there is this first one is then regular

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.560
 motivations,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.640
 that many sentient beings, or we all have that, that many motivations.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.720
 And then also very connected to the Dharma.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.230
 And in the teachings there are some individualists, they do practice Dharma, but thinking of the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.120
 small range of the view.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.400
 The vision is small, range of the vision is quite small, just thinking mainly of these lifetimes.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 Or if they believe next life, they like thinking of the, such as heaven, or something kind of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.480
 higher stage, that I would like to do this practice,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:58.640
 do these things to become comfortable, beautiful life, in this life, and believing then also in the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 future go to the heavens.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 Or the gods, such as, or individual, back to the human beings, human realms, be good.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.760
 Just thinking of those, those and practice Dharma.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.240
 And that also mainly connected with the very only way, as at worldly concerns.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.080
 Something that we like, something we don't like, those are known at worldly concerns, and many of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.480
 you already heard that.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.160
 This is Monday, just a very average, decent average, attitude, and their wish, and their thinking,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.240
 it's genuinely wonderful, it's beautiful.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.830
 That worry will be the foundation of in the teaching, in the Mahayana teaching, it will be stuck in

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.120
 stone to go over and higher, and then go beyond.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.420
 So those are known as post-motivation of the lesser, lesser, or post-motivation, or small-mot

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.080
ivation of the individuals.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.040
 And in the teaching said, "Tiwo Chum," in a way, small localized vision, localized range of the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.520
 view there.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.160
 And then the second motivation is known as the mediocre motivations of the individuals.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.720
 That directly deals with the practitioners, again in the Buddha's teaching, such as in the Mahayana

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 point of view, those are known as the Hinayana practitioners.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.180
 And thinking of that, like to be free from the sufferings of the samsara, not just thinking to go

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.160
 to the God's realms, or go back to the human's realm, but like to out of the samsara.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.880
 And thinking of little more wider range than the post-view, post-vision of the individual.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.720
 The whole thing, that I like to go out of this mess, and out of these places, it is not good, it's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.840
 not comfortable, it's disgusting, be bothering me, my life, my life, and this life also too is

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.160
 bothering me.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.010
 And now I understand what is the cause and what is the condition, the source, it is ego, it is ego,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:27.420
 it is ego, that is what I like to remove this ego, and like to use, use the emergency exit door, go

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:35.960
 out, draft it, and up is enough, and up is enough, that's what they say, and move out, instant.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:44.830
 That range is in the teaching, as I said many times, according to the Hinayana point of view, that

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.890
 is mediocre intention, not too many others thinking of one's own self safe comfort, zone for

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:00.760
 permanent, for ever good things, thinking of that, and that is what it is.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:10.630
 And the next one is then, the bigger vision, the vastness of more vision, this is known as then,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:20.090
 the biggest vision of the big guys, big guys vision, it is the biggest of the big guys, guys, and

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.710
 that is then, the Mahayana vision, thinking, not just only thinking of themself for this life or

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.560
 the next life,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.500
 not just also even out of the samsara, but thinking of all the sentient beings, like to stay in the

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.600
 samsara, to help, to guide, and to support, to liberate every living beings, through the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.670
 enlightened status, that's why develop the bodhicchathas, and those bodhicchathas, known as then,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:58.410
 the shepherd-like bodhicchathas, cello-like bodhicchathas, king-like bodhicchathas, or royal-like

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.360
 bodhicchathas,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.960
 those are three different ways, but basic goal is to remove every sentient beings, from the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.940
 suffering, and from the difficulties, from troubles, for that very purpose, even had to stay in the

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.560
 samsara, as long as needed to stay.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:27.710
 And such as, like examples, great bodhicchathas, our lokudishvara, namanjishri, vagapanis, and so

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.460
 forth, all those great bodhicchathas, that who is rigid already enlightened state, yet still

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.710
 standing on the threshold of the bodhicchathas, or in one way to understand that, that's what

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.560
 teaching says.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.880
 They are really in the tentacle, the bodhisattva, is hiding that, purposely to benefit, to help all

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.560
 the sentient beings.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.390
 It did not mean, when you are reaching enlightenment, when you become the Buddha, Buddha, that you

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.980
 cannot benefit for all the sentient beings, that's what the namakaya is, to benefit for all the

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.560
 beings.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.330
 But however, it shows their intention, their courage, their commitment, their willingness to help

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.760
 to all the sentient beings, to remove the suffering, the difficulties, troubles, every living

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.560
 beings.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 This is the whole vastness, motivation of the bodhicchathas.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.020
 Among that three work motivations, this is Mahayana teaching, and we are the followers of the Mahay

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.560
ana practitioners.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:35.490
 Therefore, then, always, great master, Kinti Vadnishri, all the lineage masters, those practice

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.560
 lineage masters, said, "Rest in our motivation".

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.560
 Because that motivation is the way we are standing.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.560
 That is our firm, solid ground of the practice and the development.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.560
 That is our, not just standing, but that's our vision.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.560
 That is our practice.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.560
 Therefore, this is the vastness, motivation of the bodhicchathas.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.560
 And again, you have the bodhicchathas.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.560
 All that is bodhicchathas, love and kindness, compassion.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.560
 But activity is so important.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560
 Reminding us, it is so important.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560
 Glorifying is so important.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.560
 Polishing is so important.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.560
 As you know, if something that you love and cherish, the souvenirs, you always take care of that.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.560
 It's not just got that and neglected that.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.560
 This is more than the souvenirs.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.560
 This is the souvenir of ours, but souvenirs of all the living beings.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.560
 Therefore, we should cherish and activate and glorify of this beautiful, precious nature.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.560
 The wish-fulfilling trees, trees that have grated all the wishes.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.560
 Not just for us, but for all the sentient beings.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.560
 We are thinking of all beings.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 We are thinking of this narrow corner-side thinking.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.560
 And that is very important.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560
 And when I received the teaching, all the great masters reminded me this.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560
 We should always resent them.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.560
 And as we went many times, I had the opportunity to go to the teaching.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.560
 And that also, the masters reminded us.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.560
 And therefore, following their footsteps, I am reminding them too.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.560
 I am reminding to you, I am reminding to my side.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.560
 We all need to cherish the strengthen of this bodhicata.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.560
 Bodhicata is kind, compassion, and is wisdom.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.560
 And then as we go to the higher stage, such as zokki teaching, bodhicata is the bodhic practice.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.560
 Bodhicata, there is nothing else besides zokki teaching than the bodhicata.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.560
 So therefore, it is, what is bodhicata is why we are using the Sanskrit word,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.560
 the enlightenment mind, a waking mind, a waking nature,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 a waking energy of the intelligence that which is within our self, our heart center.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560
 Today, zokki practice, we are waking up that.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.560
 We bring up that on the state, of the brilliant states.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.560
 We like to remove all the photos and the misses of the dust that bother us,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.560
 preventing of this beauty in nature.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.560
 That is what we are practicing.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.560
 That is therefore, we should strengthen this, this motivation.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 This motivation is the foundation.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.560
 With that motivation, then as the Vaidyana motivation, purity understands.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.560
 Purity understanding that suppose we have this vastness motivation as foundation,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:38.560
 then purity motivation is the ornament, ornament, decorators, decorators.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.560
 That is what is your breath.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 And we combined together, truly then we become the great practitioners.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.560
 Whether we have the name or not, we become the great yogi and yogi-ness in Vaidyana teachers.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.560
 And in bodhi, in Vaidyana teaching, we truly become the great bodhisattva,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.560
 the man and the female.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.560
 And that is what the great master, what I call noble daughter, noble son,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.560
 truly we become the noble son and noble daughter.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.560
 Noble son and noble daughter is not just names, is not name.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.560
 When you glorify of this energy, the glory is waking this nature,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.560
 then truly we become the noble son or the noble daughter.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.560
 That is noble, we become noble leaders.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560
 The period of the holy, this is holy.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.560
 This is the one the bodhi jata is.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.560
 And that's what is so important.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 And we do some understanding and then we move to the teaching.
