00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Unbreakable word. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, that stumped me.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 This unbreakable word is this word where we are. It's in Tibet, it says "mamji". "Mamji gikti".

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 In the pronunciation, "mamji gikti". I see.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 "Mamji" means "unbreakable". Yeah, but why? Why is that calling "unbreakable"?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Because this, particularly, this era, this era or the time of the Buddha Chaka Muni,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 when it comes to this era, what is unbreakable, that emotion, the sentient beings,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 are the human beings that emotion is so strong, the emotions are so glued so strongly to theirs.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 So it's just not easy to separate that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 That's why it is called unbreakable.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 In the New Mingua, it's so strong, hard, and it's just tense, it's really unbreakable.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 For that reason, what is the teaching said, too.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 But among the old one thousand Buddha, when Buddha see,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and with Buddha, according to the teaching, when Buddha came to this world,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 they know exactly what the situation will be before they came.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 And all one thousand Buddhists see that all the different eras,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 this particular time when Buddha Chaka Muni came this world,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 the emotion is so strong, hard, dense of the human beings, it's just hardly to break.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 So that makes it difficult to benefit, difficult to mature their mind.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 So then all Buddhists are kind of a little bit, all Buddhists are a little bit hesitant.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Hesitated, in the teaching said.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 But Buddha Chaka Muni came on the front, said, "I will go."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 So therefore, Buddha Chaka Muni is also, according to the teaching,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 at a regular level, he is so strong.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 He is the most courageous person among all the one thousand Buddha,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 and therefore he is praised as white lotus.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 White lotus among all the lotus.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 In the teaching said, said that in the ancient time,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 a long time ago, that time, inhabitants are not completely developed.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 According to the teaching said, a long time ago,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 the old is completely formed, and then inhabitants are not yet developed,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 loved, and at that time, there are these big oceans or lights there,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 and they started growing beautiful lotus.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Growing lotus, so beautiful lotus, really growing.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 But among every one, all the lotus are all red, except one.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 One is white, very beautiful.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And many gods saw that, all that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 They said, "Oh, it's so beautiful flowers,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 but all there is such as everything is red,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 but it's just only one white flower, why is that kind of flower?"

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 There.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 And then some others said, "Oh, this is the indication of the word 'pruchure.'"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Pruchure will be in there, great teacher will come.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And among all the teachers, there is one great teacher,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 well, except the difficult times of this era, of the eons,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 and that is what is indicated, and that is what the Buddha Shakyamuni is.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So that's really in the teaching sense.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 The Buddha Shakyamuni is a courage, and so therefore, many times in the teaching,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 that maybe you sometimes mention this mungi,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 many times, this mungi or the unbreakable world of this.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Okay, thank you. Yes, yes, yes, please.
