00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Chachidelix, this is again Tibetan New Year's, at the beginning of tomorrow, according to this part

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 of the world,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.880
 which is the Water Rabbit Year of the Tibetan Royal Era.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.380
 And I wish you all that days, from all around, happy, joy, peace, good health, every abundance of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.800
 all the goodness qualities,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 really wish that, and no more wars, no more natural disasters happening anywhere else.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.920
 And everyone enjoys respecting the appreciation and the goodness of their inner qualities, and we

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.840
 hear every one of these.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.010
 To support and to populate this wish, and I'd like to do some sprays to Gurga Venma Sambhu, and as

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.840
 was Tara,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 which is always known as the "bless of the degeneration time" of these eras.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 So, for the first time in Gurga Sambhu, it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu was born.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 But it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu has been born.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 So, it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu has been born.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 So, it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu has been born.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 So, it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu has been born.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 So, it's been a very long time since Gurga Sambhu has been born.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 Thank you, best wishes.
