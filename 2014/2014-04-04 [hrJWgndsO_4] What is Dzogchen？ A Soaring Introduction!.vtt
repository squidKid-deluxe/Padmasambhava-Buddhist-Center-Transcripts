00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Tidal as a red, red, clear light, great perfection, or great completions, if I translate it, great

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.480
 completions.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 Clear light, clear light, referring to now the nature of the mind, clear nature.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.140
 What means clear light? Clear light is free from the dualities, free from the subject notion, free

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.800
 from the optical notion, it is believed clear light.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.960
 Where it is, this is residing within our heart, and that is going through more, and the teacher

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.160
 will come, so I won't talk about that.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 But that is the word. One is free from the subject, free from the object, that is the nature.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.660
 And we are going to bring down that to the more simple way, meaning the natural one which is free

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.160
 from the duality.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 The natural one which is free from the duality, that is clear light, clear light, believed light.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 Of course, it talks more about that, and then we will follow that to that way.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.160
 And the great completion, great completion is then Dzocchi teaching.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.350
 That means Dzocchi teaching is everything is completed. Everything is completed, nothing is really

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160
 missing in that nature, this nature.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.500
 Because it is all that what we are talking, loving kindness, compassion, wisdom, understanding,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.160
 love, embody each other, devotion, everything is concluded, nothing is missing.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.940
 Where is conclusion? In the nature of the mind. How that nature of the mind is clear light status,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.160
 that nature.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.020
 And where is residing? And that is then in the teaching we go follow, but is residing within our

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.160
 heart, within our nature, within our heart center.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 It is residing, and in great completion stages. Nothing is missing, missing, missing.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.050
 And that means everything. For example, in the Buddha's teaching, the Hinayana teaching is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.160
 completed with Dzocchi.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 Mahayana teaching is completed in Dzocchi, and our Tantra teaching is completed in Dzocchi.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.270
 Mahayoga teaching is completed in Dzocchi, Anayoga teaching is completed in Dzocchi, and therefore,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.160
 it is every complete, everything.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 Samsara is completed in Dzocchi, Narayana is completed in Dzocchi, nothing is missing after that.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 What is that? That is our ended nature of the mind.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.900
 Samsara comes from our nature of the mind, Narayana comes from our nature of the mind, everything

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.160
 comes from our nature of the mind.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 It is manifested, report that. When it comes down, come back, it all is our nature of the mind.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.230
 What that nature of the mind is is clear like luminosity. What that clear like luminosity is beyond

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.160
 duality.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.720
 Duality is beyond the conception, beyond the duality. That ended nature is Dzocchi. That is the one

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.160
 degree.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 And for that reason, it is called Dzocchi, great completions.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.470
 When you have that realization, when you have that realization, understand exactly as it is, then

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.160
 it is also known as great proportions.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
 Nothing is imperfect. Nothing is imperfect.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.160
 Perfection in perfect perfection is duality. But the Dzocchi level is beyond everything.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.160
 Therefore, Dzocchi teaching, sometimes we use, all is good. Everything is good, but there are some

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160
 in the Buddha.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
 Nothing is not good. Perfect. Good and bad are the levels of the dualities.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.560
 Reality level, the soul is the same, discipline is the same, ending is the same. What is the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.160
 difference?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.840
 Only the duality level. How long we level this? According to the Buddha teaching, we level this

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.160
 from the sense of beginning times, beginning less times.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.160
 Throughout the lifetime, we level, we level, we level, holding, holding, and then become tangent.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:57.680
 It becomes like ice. Ice and we trap that. When the ice is melted, where that goes? It becomes

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.160
 water.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.160
 Water is smooth, smooth, tender in a way. That is how it is.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.410
 So therefore, the understanding of Dzocchi is not just a partiality attitude, giving something and

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.160
 trying to take something or accept something.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.110
 Accepting the rejection and the sorting out that we have been doing all the time is the game of

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.160
 dualities.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.720
 Game of duality. If duality goes a little stronger, more kind of singly out, what is called ego cl

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.160
ings, then ego clings, clings.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 And then it goes on and on, lubrication, this and that thing. All is level.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.170
 Today, we are trying to release, unknot all those lubrication things. Trying to unknot. Release

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.160
 that.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 How are we going to release it? We are not going to release unknot that with duality as we do.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.620
 At the Dzocchi level, we are using that unknot what the teaching will explain. You read these books

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.160
, you already know those things, I think.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:12.370
 It is self-liberative. Without a subject or object, without effort, effort, simple, easy, caring,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.160
 calm, peaceful, very low-key, and be as natural.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.700
 Please, that is what we are going to release. And that technique, to release that technique, what

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.160
 is called then here, in the debate, I am sure it is isolated there too.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:41.700
 Te-chu. Te-chu. Te-chu. Cutting tolerance. Cutting tolerance. Cutting tolerance teaching is not the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:50.160
 subject or object level. Cutting, cutting as regular, mundane level, even though all use as Te-chu.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160
 Te-chu.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:07:04.730
 This cutting tolerance is beyond duality. Relaxing its own natural status. Not pursuing the duality

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:12.160
, rather looking to the source of duality and then just letting it go.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:21.170
 And that is what in Dzocchi teaching we have heard so many times. Let it come, let it come, let it

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.160
 go. Let not stop the movement of the discipline of the nature.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:35.190
 Nature, no, we are not trying to invoke it by the conception, by the dualities. Relaxing in the

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:42.160
 personal status. As nature is present, we are in the personal status.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.920
 We are not in the past, we are not in the future, even though we have future status, but we are in

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:57.410
 the present. Let be in the present as we are. Be stay in the present. Let be everything come,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.160
 everything go.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 As nature does, without a level, without like manipulating, without a direction by the dualities.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.160
 That is what Te-chu is called. Te-chu. Te-chu.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.550
 And the teaching said, "Relaxing the natural state of the pure from the beginning." Natural is pure

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:22.160
 from the beginning. Relaxing that natural state through the means of the poor abiding techniques.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.950
 Those also teaching will tell them, "You good, we hurt the poor abiding techniques." With that,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:34.520
 when you relax in the pure abiding techniques, relax ourselves on the present state with the poor

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.160
 abiding techniques.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:45.630
 Techniques, all the dualities and the publications naturally liberated, merge it back to the

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:53.160
 natural status without even trace. Trace. That is known as Te-chu, cutting poorly.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.820
 It is not cutting poorly as a subject or object with knife and so forth, with effort. Effort

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.830
 cutting is not joking. Effort techniques are used in the Buddha teaching in order to lead, to bring

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.160
 this understanding.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.560
 In the Hinayana teaching, in the Mahayana teaching, in the even in the Vedayana teaching, use those

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.460
 with some of the effort and all these things because we are trying to direct it to the way from the

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.160
 old habit patterns.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:37.470
 When we reach to the Dokkan level, we are going to relax, calm and free. When we read that for many

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.810
 times, use also carefree, prayerfree status, relaxing, calm and faithful, bring forth more joy,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.160
 appreciation and both each other and devotion, respect.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:50.160
 Even those beautiful things are also really immediately merged back to it is own souls. So relaxed.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.320
 There is no ripples, ripples, calm and faithful, serenities, the movements they display there,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.160
 arising energy there, relaxing, calm and peaceful.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:12.160
 That is the word. What is it known as? What is it called? The Tu-Chu. Tu-Chu.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:24.360
 And then here, Thava. Thava is a great word, word, vu. So this is the vu. This is what we are

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.160
 talking. What I am talking is now, we are beholding the vu.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.890
 You are beholding the vu. You know, we are glancing. I hope, I hope. We are glancing of the vu, vu

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.160
 by this talking, by I talking.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.800
 This vu is not a word of something else, something in other directions of our way. We are talking v

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.160
u that we inherit our nature. We are talking our vu, your vu, what I am talking.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.390
 That is what the Buddha is talking. That is what the great master and the guru and the master, the

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.160
 madra, even they say they wrote this book, that book.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.860
 But this book is not their books. That book is our book, our explanation of our nature, your nature

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.160
.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:20.320
 How to bring thought and discover our treasures. My treasures, your treasures, your richness, my

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.160
 richness. That is what we are talking about.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:30.160
 When you behold that, when you have the glimpse of understanding, that is known as vu.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.160
 This vu is not alien. We are involved in some aliens from outside trying to make that sense here.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:45.840
 We have been revealing our own beauty, nature. This is what we are going to, that is our playground

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.160
.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:53.160
 Vu is our playground in me. We are going to move with that playground, vu playground.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.860
 This playground is our playground, your playground. You are the central of these playgrounds,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.160
 playgrounds.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:11.770
 We are going to behold, revel, play the games, all these things. Let it come, let it go, let it be,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.160
 and be relaxed. Explore more, explore more.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.160
 Let it come, let it go, let it be. That is what it's name is.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:28.160
 So this is what vu is. And we are talking of this vu again. What is vu?

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:37.110
 Vu is unimpeded nature of your nature, unimpeded nature, clay-like luminous status, in prison

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.160
 status.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:49.160
 Our vu is not past. Our vu is not the future. Our vu, your vu, your nature is right present.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.160
 That is your vu and my vu. We are going to maintain that.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:02.160
 This vu is very, very important because this is the one in the others of teaching.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:10.160
 Teaching said that three words of garab dody, three words of garab dody, possibly introducing,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160
 there are many translations, it's kind of different, could translate, many translations, personally

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.160
,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:24.160
 but introducing the real nature of your own and the nature of your own mind, or our own mind.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.160
 This nature of your own mind is the vu. That is what we are going to, you are going to vu.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:40.160
 When we are meditating, in the Dzogti meditator, you are beholding that vu, how vu?

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.160
 Even your looks like gazing outside, but in fact, you are gazing your inner space, vu.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:56.160
 Gaving inner space will be relaxing calm. That inner space is present.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.850
 It's not the past, it's not the future. It is actually in fact, in the Buddha teaching or the Dzog

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:02.160
ti teaching,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:09.160
 it's even not present thought or in the consultative level present. It's beyond three times.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:16.160
 So it's beyond the past, beyond the future, beyond the present, it's beyond.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.160
 That known is a great present status. In that sense, what that means?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.160
 It means, because three times is also still the conception of past, present, and future.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:36.950
 But Dzogti, your nature, now our vu, your vu, is not in that conceptual frame of the times, it's

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.160
 beyond.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:46.160
 And you are relaxing that nature. That is, so that is the vu, really about the vu.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:55.160
 And then of course, this teaching talks, teaching explaining more, more about this.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:05.780
 Now, the next one is, he said that speed up all the bermis and parts, speed up all the bermis and

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.160
 parts so fast.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:13.760
 And then fly to Garuda, speed up this. So that means, when you are relaxing on that person's state

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.160
 of the Dzogti,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.160
 person's state of the Dzogti, or when you are relaxing on that natural state of mind,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:29.160
 the pew from the beginning, kada, kada is the pew from the beginning, kada, santhara, unempatent,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:39.160
 an organ nature of the kunduzang. When you are relaxing on that natural status, all the bermis and

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
 parts are totally,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:49.970
 you've been so fast, you reach to the organ state where Buddhas are, where Buddha is, or where Budd

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.160
has are, actually.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:59.160
 Buddhas are. Buddhas are in the Dharmakaya status, always. And Sambokaya status, Narmakaya status.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:06.360
 When you relax on that natural state of mind beyond the three times in that natural status, you, we

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.160
 are in the Dharmakaya status.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:16.160
 To reach the Dharmakaya status according to suttara, how long it takes? Three countless eons,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 according even to Mahayana, three countless eons.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.660
 Then in the Kariyat, then there is like six to three light times, seven light times, three light

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.160
 times, and so forth, so forth.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:39.380
 In this case, we instantly reach to the, the, exactly the, the organ state, the absolute status, as

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.160
 exactly the true nature is.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:51.760
 And that's what, what we've heard many times. Mungaling our mind with Dharmakayas. Mungaling with

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.160
 our mind at Dharmakaya is not just notion.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.360
 When you are relaxed on the Dharmakaya status without disturbed by the, the mundane conceptions, we

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.160
 are within the Dharmakaya state of mind.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:11.920
 Mind, that is what is. But our, even we are relaxed on that natural state of mind because our dual

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.160
ity is so strong, so dense and so powerful.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:22.410
 There is a window of light comes for a short moment and then again cloud comes and covered up by

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.160
 that.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:29.490
 For that reason, then practice of the Dzogchen. Dzogchen are any practices, of course, in sutra

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.160
 teaching that we need joyful effort.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:44.850
 We need devotions. We need bodhicitta. Combine together. Combine together, marriage the continuity,

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.160
 joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, and devotion combine together.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.860
 And occasionally thinking of those, this precious lives, how this life is so precious. Not I said

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.160
 maybe occasion, but we should think that.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.160
 We should reflect precious lives. And also in parliament, cause and effort are inevitable.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:09.020
 And cause and effort, the results are inevitable. And Samsara has a lot of difficulties and

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.160
 troubles and challenges.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.160
 Thinking of those, what those will do? In the teaching said, always it is true.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.160
 If we think of those things, it makes our heart more soft, soft heart, more tender heart.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.160
 At the same time we become more practical, more practical, more sensible.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.730
 More we bring more common sense to our knowledge. We can understand more kind of respect,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.160
 appreciation, considerations.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.160
 All those will follow and we start reflecting the precious lives, how life is so precious.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:53.160
 How life is also pride in parliament. And cause and effort, the results are inevitable.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 And then Samsara has a lot of difficulties, challenges, ups and downs, changes, all of that.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:07.160
 Think of those, these things. Zokim practitioners generally should think those.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 Even the great Zokim master, Palfra Rumbuji, he is always the new Rumbuji.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
 And the Muammar Rumbuji, they always emphasize on those.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.430
 And all the long keepers, when you read books of their life story, read all the Zokim master, all

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.160
 the Muhammad master, everyone.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.610
 And all those say again that because it will resettle our mind, myself more settled down, we become

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.160
 more sensible.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.600
 Not just always become self-important or kind of hovering all the time with the ego, all the time

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.160
 something.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.160
 More kind of relaxed, more sensible, more appreciative.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.160
 To appreciate to our family, friends, neighbors and more sensibles.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:55.160
 We become good person, good person. That means we are taking the life, meaning of our lives.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.160
 And that's what. So therefore again, part and the boomies.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:11.160
 Part of course, there is five parts. Those are known as the five parts you all know.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.160
 I will just say name. Our name was this accumulation part.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 Second is the application part.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.160
 And third is the seeing part.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.160
 And fourth is the meditation part.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.160
 Fifth is part of normal study.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.160
 No more things to do, to achieve the realizations.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
 So therefore, there are five parts.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.160
 First the booming, first the part.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 But first the part.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.160
 First the part of accumulation part.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 And the application parts are, according to the teaching, they are still in the level of samsaras.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.160
 We are trying to make things to change the samsaras.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.160
 Accumulation part, application part.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:10.160
 The seeing part is the first time that now we behold the view exactly as it is without presumption,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.160
 without theory, without consumption, or without analytics.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.160
 Seeing, natural as it is, naked, fresh.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 Fresh as, for example, as you see built with brilliant sky,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:36.160
 free from the clothes and misty dusters, you see how clear, bright it is.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.160
 You see, and we see that same way seeing that nature.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.160
 That is what the seeing part is.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160
 Then the meditation part.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.160
 The meditation part, from the seeing part all the way to meditation part is known as then,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.160
 in the booming level, 10 boomies.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 All the 10 boomies started with first the booming, and the seeing parts are senor nails.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 Senor nails.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.160
 And then continually you advance one after another, one after another.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:14.160
 And then reach to the 10th boomies, advancing.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:21.160
 What you are advancing in this time, you are advancing all the parameters,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:27.160
 all the beautiful practices, advancing, developing, expanding,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:37.160
 deepening of our joy, our appreciation, our love, our kindness, our detachment, our realization.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:44.160
 And along with that, our compromise, our generosity, our passion, our joyful effort,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:51.160
 our concentrations, our wisdom, our skillful means, our powers, our inspirations,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.160
 the wisdom knowledge, all that one after another,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:03.160
 developing, shining, and expanding, fulfilling, yet so humble, so simple,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.160
 drawn to the earth, as I said, it brings a common sense,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.160
 more common sense, more sensible, and more drawn to the earth.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.160
 Look at this, Buddha is written higher than realization that what we Buddha call in Buddhism.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.160
 How humble, when you read the Buddha's teaching, how humble, how simple.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.160
 He goes with the monks and his nuns' teachings, with bare feet and holding his own,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.160
 begging balls, begging balls wearing his robe.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.160
 That's what the Buddha is.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.160
 That's how really Buddha Buddha, how simple and humble.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 All these great masters you do read, such a great master, realization,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 that humble and simple, more kind of mingling with everyone,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.160
 they're not kind of bursted outside on the spotlight, this, and this, and that things.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 So simple.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.160
 That's how the sign of the realization comes.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.160
 Sign of realization is individual, so gentle, so peaceful.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.160
 All the activities of the body become gentle, peaceful.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 Speech is become gentle, peaceful, more polite, more humble, more respectful.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.160
 Mind is soft as day, free from the ego.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.160
 Duality, anger, emotion, those all evaporated in the full love of comparison.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.160
 But that is a rise.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 That is the word that this great master, this realization shines forth.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.160
 So that is the word, really, about this.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160
 Masalaam.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 Then this powerful plight of garutas.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.160
 Powerful plight of garutas.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 So when you have this zoking vu, the tenkyu vu, all zoking vus,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 and keeping up that, when you discover, when you're maintaining that,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.160
 as you discover that vu, that we are in the plight of garutas.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.160
 We are powerful plight of garutas.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.160
 That will speed roughly at once all the bad bhumis and parts.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160
 Parts.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 And as I said, according to the sutramahayana level,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.160
 to reach the buddha board, three countless eos.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160
 Three countless.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160
 Even that is the, in the buddha teaching said, said like, what's called,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.160
 there is three categories.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.160
 The vast capabilities of the individual practitioners

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.160
 that in the following sutramah, reached the buddha board in three countless eos.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 Such as buddha shakimani, that is.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.160
 And the second capabilities of the individual who follow in the Mahayana path,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.160
 reached enlightenment in seven countless eos.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.160
 Seven countless eos, that's it.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.160
 And third capability of the practitioners who followed again the Mahayana path,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.160
 with joy in love and joy of effort,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.160
 call it commandment, the reaching, but about thirty-two countless eos.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 Countless eos.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.160
 That is what's said.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.160
 And here, within the single lifetimes, in the sub-teaching said,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.160
 if you have the vast technique, and with joy and devotion both each other,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.160
 and receive the teaching, maybe at the beginning well you're sitting on the cushion,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.160
 you are only beings, but when you get up into the cushion,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.160
 you are in the past bhoomi or maybe more.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160
 That's what really said.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 That's how fast it is.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 And for those reasons, then in the mala-repa's work,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160
 teaching said, zouki teaching is so spiritual,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.160
 if you receive this heard this teaching,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.160
 and moment you glimpse, you are enlightenment in that,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.160
 if you receive that teaching on practice in the evening time,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.160
 you reach enlightenment in the evening time.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.160
 If you read this teaching and practice that in the morning,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.160
 you reach enlightenment in the morning time.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.160
 And in some cases, they don't need any effort to just do the practice.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.160
 Practice you received zouki teaching, you reach enlightenment instantly.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.160
 That's what it says.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.160
 So that, this great master, Rungbung Haga,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.160
 said that to zouki master Rungbung Haga,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 said to mala-repa and mala-repa thought,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.160
 oh, that's really, I'm the one of the fortunate ones,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.160
 I'm the one of the, I think it's really fortunate.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.160
 And I practice all those black maggies,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.160
 kind of achieved so quickly, I able to do quickly.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.160
 And today I made this such a great teacher.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.160
 And now I receive this teaching.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.160
 I think I'm the one of the best candidate.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.160
 So I don't need to practice.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160
 I thought, he thought, I don't need to practice.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.160
 With that thought, he's sleeping, sleeping, sleeping.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.160
 So then this teacher came, Rungbung Haga came, came in the morning.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.160
 He's so, so, so sleeping.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.160
 So he said, my student, what happened to you?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.160
 He said, because teacher, you told,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.160
 the fortunate ones, we don't have to meditate and practice.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.160
 So I thought, I'm the one of the fortunate to meet inside you

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.160
 and it's such a great teaching.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.160
 So that's what I'm sleeping, he said.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.160
 So then, so then this Rungbung Haga said, oh, oh, this is not my connected disciple.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.160
 He said, he should go, he should go to then Marpa.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.160
 He should go to Marpa.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.160
 And then he told, you should go to the Marpa.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.160
 And Marpa is your, your currently connected teacher.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 And then, of course, the moment he heard the Marpa's name,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.160
 same thing as Yaukar has heard his teacher's name.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.160
 He said, really, this is, his sports come out.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.160
 It's kind of like, chills up, chills up.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.160
 And he's just eager to see him.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.160
 And then he went to the Marpa.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.160
 So, so that's what, then Marpa, I mean, then meet,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.160
 all the Malaripas life story begins, the realization that begins.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.160
 That's how it is.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.160
 So, so therefore, I mean, so fast, so instant, and is,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.160
 but you have to, that instant, even though it's so fast,

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.160
 so special, it's like, as I use the example as modern time,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.160
 maybe it's space shuttle, shuttle, space shuttle challenges.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.160
 Space challenge challenges.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.160
 When you do, when you have that challenge, challenges,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.160
 it's not just enough, you have to challenge, space shuttle challenge.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.160
 You have to prepare to, to go in that shuttles.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.160
 How many times you have to go to Kep Kanewa?

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.160
 Kep Kanewa and learn to go in there.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.160
 That is what we have to do.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.160
 We have the space shuttle, truly.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.160
 We have the flight with Garuda's, but we have to be prepared.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.160
 We have, this preparation is not just, we prepare it some way,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 and then go to flight.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.160
 We prepare along with well-being in the shuttle, or challenges,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.160
 well-being in the flight of Garuda's.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.160
 That is devotion.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.160
 That is bodhicitta.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
 That is a six paramata.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.160
 That is, as I said, condensed all the six paramata.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.160
 Then I say, "Yes, sir, I'll make three trainings, three trainings,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.160
 trainings, morality, concentration, customs."

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.160
 Those all break. That is what we're going to break.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.160
 We prepare that.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.160
 Then we take this shuttle, truly, and apply the Garuda,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.160
 then everything will be speed up, speed up, and reach enlightenment.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:29.160
 Now, for that, that is really about fun and Buddhism.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.160
 Now, flight of Garuda is a metaphor, metaphor names.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.160
 Garuda, in the teaching, said, "Garuda is a celestial bird.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:46.160
 A celestial bird, it has power, so powerful, so rich, so quickly.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.160
 The places, because it's so powerful, speed up, but also, Garuda is so high.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.160
 Birds cannot fly so high as Garuda.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.160
 So he has the best bird eyes, wolves.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:08.160
 Garuda has the bird best, the super bird eyes, eye wolves.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.160
 And also, Garuda has what powers?

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160
 Garuda has powers.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 Turn the poison into the man. He can eat the poison instantly.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.160
 Instantly, and he's not going to affect that.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.160
 So he's not going to have to run from the poison.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.160
 Rather, he enjoyed the sumptuous of the poisons

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.160
 and used that growth and spread the splendid power of the Garuda.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.160
 Those are the metaphors of the Dzokhi teachings.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160
 Dzokhi is the highest of wolves.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.160
 That's Garuda's bird eyes, highest of best eyes.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 And long time American in the teaching said,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.160
 "The Dzokhi's wheel is like the wheel of the top of the mountain,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:58.160
 looking to the top of the mountain every 360-degree angles, every direction."

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:05.160
 You're not looking in one corner side of that, all 360-degree angles.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.160
 Angles. So that is what Dzokhi is. It's like Garuda's, Garuda's.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.160
 And then Garuda is so fast, and we make that already, make it.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 And Garuda don't have to skip from the poisons,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.160
 trying to avoid that, reject that.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.160
 Garuda can consume that to spread out.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.160
 Dzokhi don't have to give up anything.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.160
 Dzokhi tried not sorting out things, this and that thing,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.160
 as is the arise, liberated that.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.160
 Use those, any emotions, use those, whatever situation comes,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 as training, the strengthening of the realization.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.160
 Understand, instant, ask Garuda all the poisons, five poisons.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.160
 Five poisons, what are the five poisons?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
 Ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, arrogance.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.160
 Those are all transcendent, liberated, right that instant,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160
 right on the origin nature state.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.160
 One is transcendented, one is become.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.160
 Five wisdom is calling of the out coming,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.160
 the expression of the energies of the five wisdom,

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.160
 arising in a different dimension, different level.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.160
 It never affected that individually,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.160
 nor it infected to the friends or others.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.160
 It's instantly liberated at that time more, glorified,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.160
 polished of our own realization,

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.160
 understanding of the nature, where things are.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:42.160
 That is the one metaphor of this, this flight of Garuda.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.160
 So this is powerful, this is big will,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:52.160
 this is transcendental, transformation, all those reasons.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160
 This is Garuda.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.160
 And then Garuda is in the Buddha's teaching,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.160
 is a celestial book and it is cited,

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:07.160
 and also in the Buddha's teaching, in the Tushida heavens.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.160
 And in the wisdom there is many, many in the Vedayana teaching,

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.160
 those are many wisdom Garudas, those are.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.160
 So really that is the meaning of the flight of Garudas.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.160
 And now maybe I just stop here,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.360
 up here, if you have some questions, I will discuss.
