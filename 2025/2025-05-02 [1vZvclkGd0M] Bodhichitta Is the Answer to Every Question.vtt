Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 9\nMay 2, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

 The gracious teacher of the Buddha Shakyamuni, his light, his kindness, his teachings.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.560
 We are lighted out, we discover our long lost or long ignored treasures.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.520
 We bring out, that's called it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.520
 This treasure is not just treasure to our own self,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.000
 treasure for all the beings, to every living being.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.760
 Share that through those with joy, appreciation, confidence,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.560
 and then recognize these inequalities

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.080
 and take this joining, this praise, and then recite this praise.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.520
 Then as many as you can do even each session.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.720
 In the teaching mentioned, mentioned over a hundred thousand times.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.680
 That means that much we meditate, that much we are connected to our treasures,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.880
 our inner treasures, treasures.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.800
 We are really activating our own treasures, glorifying our treasures,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.840
 repolishing our treasures, cherishing our treasures.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.840
 Feel that and then find this.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.520
 After that, then in the teaching says, "Receive all the blessing, light, and the kingdom."

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080
 All that refuge to your kingdom is dissolved

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.400
 in the light and merged to your self, to your own nature of the mind,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.360
 to your own nature of the three Gaya status.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.280
 Status and meditating as much as you have time.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.600
 Relax on that status.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.080
 Then the next one is the bodhicitta.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.640
 I mentioned and of course you all know,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.720
 the external bodhicitta, the relative bodhicitta,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.080
 which hurts so many times.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.400
 Wishing bodhicitta and then actualizing bodhicitta.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.840
 Those both are known as relative bodhicitta.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.720
 First is wishing bodhicitta.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.560
 And that is wishing bodhicitta is as we mentioned,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.520
 a good heart, a good heart for all living beings.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.040
 That good heart is wishing bodhicitta, sizzling quality,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.240
 waking up that beautiful treasure in the midst of all the ego,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 habit patterns, clothes, is really waking up now.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.720
 Coming out, coming out, that is wishing bodhicitta.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.840
 Read that thought and then take rafuji vows.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.200
 All rafuji pray, all sorry bodhicitta vows.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.720
 And taking, not sorry, rafuji is the foundation of all the practices.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.600
 Now if we don't have the rafuji vows, rafuji practices,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.240
 we won't have the bodhicitta according to teaching.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.480
 The foundation of the bodhicitta,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.360
 no matter whichever schools you are, is rafuji.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.560
 So we the rafuji and then we take the bodhicitta.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.440
 Bodhicitta, and bodhicitta vow is wishing bodhicitta.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.880
 Wishing bodhicitta.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880
 And in order to do wishing bodhicitta,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.440
 then we have to activate wishing bodhicitta,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 which is called activating bodhicitta.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.880
 And then of course those are translated in slightly different ways,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.440
 that you all know slightly.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.400
 But what it is, first is intention,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.040
 and then they take the vows, and then wishing activating bodhicitta.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.320
 Activating bodhicitta is, then literally bodhicitta is six paramata,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.600
 best upon the poor, immeasurable as is.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.120
 All that means, best upon the wishing bodhicitta,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.680
 you perform the six paramata practices.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.440
 Six paramata practice.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.720
 A six paramata practice is also known as accumulating merits.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.320
 We are often heard, in order to reach enlightenment,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.920
 in order to dispel all our heavy load of the duality and habit patterns,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.280
 we need to get up to the two merits.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.360
 Merit is a force.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.680
 Merit is a powerful wind.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.800
 Merit is powerful like fire.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.680
 Fire that will burn, skee, clean way, clear way.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.960
 Like water, spring water, clear way.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.520
 That, that is merit.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.960
 Merit, merit is then six paramata,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.200
 best upon the, this poor, immeasurable.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520
 Immeasurable, that is.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.480
 Then, among that, always in the teaching highlight,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.960
 in this teaching highlight, three morality.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.000
 Morality, three, morality, of course,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.640
 every those six paramata has three, divided into three, three, three.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.040
 But morality, in the highlight of that, is three moralities.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.400
 The morality that avoid those three are,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.840
 morality that will avoiding all the negative activities.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.080
 By body, by speech, and by mind.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.040
 Avoid all negative activities.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.600
 That is generally the morality.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.200
 In the Buddha teaching, gracious teacher,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.560
 Buddha Shakyam in the teaching, is conduct.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.520
 Conduct of the body, conduct of the speech.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.280
 And that then, of course, all those two conductors

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.840
 are relying with the conduct of the mind.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.600
 Mind is the instrumental.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.440
 Behind the scenes, ruled every other conduct.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.320
 So, conduct of the mind.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.720
 Avoid negative activities.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.840
 That is number, I mean, not number one, or one of the morality.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.040
 Second morality, of course, many of you already know.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.400
 The performing, or gathering, all the virtuous activities.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.480
 Morality that gathers all the virtuous, positive activities.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.600
 By body, by speech, and by mind.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.640
 By.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.120
 And what is that virtues?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.680
 Virtues, by body.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.760
 Virtues, performing good deeds by the body.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.760
 Good activities.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.240
 Military activities.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.080
 Supported to the communities.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.000
 Supported to the monasteries.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.480
 Supported to the congregations.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.720
 Something, serviced to the others, that will fail.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.120
 Or serviced to the three dual in the Buddha teaching of the religion.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.080
 Buddha, Dharma, Sanghas.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.960
 And then virtuous activity of the speech.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.520
 What?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.800
 Polite.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.920
 Kind world.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.120
 Polite world.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.320
 Gentle world.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.880
 Respect.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.760
 Respect.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.920
 Also, physical activity.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.560
 Also, in the great master, Shanti Devas.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.600
 When you look to the Shanti beings or the other beings,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.720
 look with eye of compassion and respect, joy.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.760
 Nice.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.160
 Smiling.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.120
 Smiling.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.360
 And it's looking gently and respectfully.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.960
 People know what they call the body language.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.400
 Others know us.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.680
 Kind of more gentle.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.800
 More peaceful.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.840
 More polite.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.040
 More nice.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.480
 All those are known as positive.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.920
 Even in the teaching of the great master, Shanti Devas.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.920
 Even you have to indicate something by not just say this and that kind of so shortly.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.560
 But gently swinging your right arm.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.120
 In the teaching mentioned, right arm is considered a kind of respect arm.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.920
 So gently swinging your right arm and showing that people can relate.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.360
 Indicating whatever that worry with the gentle world.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.640
 Those are all known as respectful.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.400
 Riches, activities.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.400
 And then, well, the virtues of the mind is love and compassion, kindness, all that.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.760
 So the guide and all the virtues activate the boat.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.600
 And that is second morality.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.520
 Third morality is, is then performing all the beneficial activities.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.040
 That whatever you can do.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.840

 Best of all with the body.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.240
 Whatever you can do.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.200
 According to your capabilities.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.520
 According to your readiness.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.360
 Not overdo.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.200
 But do.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.480
 Don't stop.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.560
 Do whatever you can do.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.320
 Do that with joy.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.400
 Do that with respectfully.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.160
 Do that with politely.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.000
 And when you did that, also you feel upward.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.440
 Or we feel upward.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.640
 We're happy in joy.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.000
 I did something good.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.120
 Feel happy.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.720
 And dedicated that merit.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.080
 May I be able to do that more to benefit all living beings.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.160
 As a gracious teacher, Buddha Shaktamani and all those great masters.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.400
 All that such as Avalokkadishara.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.840
 Mejishi, Vaitya Pani.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.160
 Even though they reach enlightenment.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.360
 Long time ago,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.120
 personally in the teaching measure,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:54.160
 they are acting as bodhisattva or to benefit more outreach to all living beings.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.680
 That was the teaching said.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.200
 So, kind of having those beautiful intentions taught.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.240
 And then, take the bodhisattva vows.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.600
 So those are kind of brilliant.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.960
 Again, I'm highly highlighted.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.400
 Bodhisattva.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.000
 Bodhisattva, relative bodhisattva.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.840
 With that, then all the parameters keeping practice.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.440
 Those are known as then.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.840
 Known as the bodhisattvas or relative bodhisattvas.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.280
 And then here too.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.880
 On this absolute bodhisattva.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.440
 Bodhisattva practices here.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.640
 Also in the teaching, mentioned that and you see here.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.320
 Said here, whole.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.800
 That all beings with their temporary computations.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:45.440
 So that is really the why we develop bodhisattva.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.960
 In this absolute bodhisattva.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.440
 Because all the beings,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.680
 beings, they're temporarily confused.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.440
 This temporary is, of course, not forever.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.880
 But it's this temporary is a long time.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.800
 When these are composed.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.960
 When we sent in beings are composed.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.200
 According to the teaching, we composed from the beginning times.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.040
 We composed.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.000
 Since that completion times,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.640
 until now, all the sentient beings are struggling.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.040
 Struggling to fix the comfortable zones.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.720
 Zones.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.920
 Everyone is looking for comfortable zones.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.040
 Something can feel secured.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.920
 Something happy.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.600
 Something really feel peaceful.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.160
 But yet, not everyone is achieving that.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.480
 Even they got something for a short time is not secured.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.200
 Is not long.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.960
 It's just the only temporary.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.040
 Boss temporary comfort, otherwise is all kidding.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.000
 Why?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.360
 Because of duality.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.840
 Consumption we created.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.160
 One's own self by ourself.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.920
 For that reason,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.280
 Grand Master Chantideva said in his teaching.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.440
 Even every living beings are longing to have happiness.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.760
 Happiness and peaceful joy.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.520
 But that very cause of happiness joy that what they have.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.640
 They're destroying without knowing by themselves.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.120
 Thinking is good for us.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.040
 With ignorance.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.040
 So therefore, what Grand Master Chantideva said.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.000
 How pathetic.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.960
 All the living beings sending me.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.200
 Thinking I'm doing something good for myself to feel happy and joy.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.200
 To kind of create more permanent, some degree happiness.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.600
 But yet, that very cause is they're destroying by the ignorance.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.320
 Ignorance.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.120
 And that ignorance is activated in the five emotions that we know.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.680
 All four emotions.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.640
 Anger.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.440
 Jealous.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.320
 Hated thoughts.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 Self-important.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:04.800
 Greeds.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.320
 Brides.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.600
 And between the combination of those, then anxieties.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.400
 Worries.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.040
 Sadness.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.680
 Sadness.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.480
 Unscured.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.120
 That endless.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.920
 Goes on and on.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.680
 Even in we human beings.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.120
 Human beings are considering, not considering.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.840
 In the greatest teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Manu said.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.800
 Higher realm.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.680
 We in higher realms.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.440
 Even we have all that things.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.280
 And even everything is a comfort.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:47.360
 Everything is perfect due to our own ego-clinging in the self-important and the greedy.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.640
 Greedy we destroy.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.120
 We spoil ourselves.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.200
 And they're trying to point their finger to someone else and create more troubles.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.120
 More troubles.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.480
 We do that.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.800
 So many times.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.920
 Why?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.000
 Because of the ignorance.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.120
 Because of this attachment.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.720
 And the greed.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.480
 How that long going to last that long?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.960
 How long?

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.400
 Not forever according to the teacher.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400
 Temporary, that's what the teacher said.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.200
 But even this temporary, they're going through all the difficulties, troubles.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.160
 For that reason, this is a great docking practitioner.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.520
 All the, in the absolute level, feel great compassion.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.880
 I'm going to help you to all them.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.000
 I'm going to help you to wake up them to the origin their energy, natural status,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.760
 pre-prong all these delusions.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.600
 Delusions.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:53.120
 For that reason, that I'm going to meditate on this natural or on the toxic status.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.440
 That's scared.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.600
 And have those good attitude or intention toward and join this place.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.040
 Then I'm joined.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.960
 And again, meditate this.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.440
 More meditating on this status.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.040
 Start this great body practice with compassion.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.760
 Kindness, compassion, thoughts.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.960
 And understand exactly the situation and circumstance what is going through.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.160
 That we can see our own outreach of these pipe senses.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.400
 We can see so many purpose.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.360
 Even this country is considering the best country on this earth,

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.160
 or one of the best country on this earth.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.360
 But how many peoples are really going through challenges?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.880
 Through that.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.760
 And don't make in other countries how many things.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.280
 And then everything of all other realms.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.640
 Hell realms.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.400
 Hungry goat realms.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.480
 Animal realms.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.720
 And animal realms.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.360
 How many animals are suffering?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.200
 How many animals are really also going?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.560
 All the challenges.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.160
 So many troubles.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.020
 That.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.240
 And they gain intention.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.280
 Everyone, same.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.080
 The happy and joy, peace, like to comfort.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.200
 But that, all that.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.520
 Because of this situation.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.880
 All that.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.320
 Igniting on the great compassion of the relative truth.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.080
 Loving kindness.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.080
 Really poor, boneless thoughts.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.000
 And then activating for the greater joyful effort.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.600
 For the dharma.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.240
 Greater joyful effort for the practice.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.120
 Meditate.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.000
 Helping to them.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.400
 Meditate with that intention.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.160
 Intention.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.640
 And then.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.680
 This is the practices.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.920
 This is all these delusions.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.600
 All these conclusions.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.680
 Start with ignorance.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.280
 How is going to liberate it?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.960
 How going to play with that?

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.400
 Self-liberating.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:06.800
 Self-liberating is not going to use some other antidotes.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.840
 And spell.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.000
 Some other antidotes.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.360
 Who created that advice?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.640
 Use simple word.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.000
 Create by the mind.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Who going to buy clever that by mind?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.800
 This is the last word.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.440
 Called homopedic techniques.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.280
 Homopedic techniques.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.760
 Use the same remedies.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.040
 Remedy to cleave it.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.680
 With the same technique.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.640
 Techniques.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.680
 So that is it.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.840
 For therefore, it is self-liberating.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.920
 Wisdom.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.480
 The mind.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.800
 Well-liberated.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.760
 Cleave it.
