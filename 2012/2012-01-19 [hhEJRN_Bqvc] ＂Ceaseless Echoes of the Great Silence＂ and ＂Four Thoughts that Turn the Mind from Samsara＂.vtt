00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 I have opened what's called? I don't know. I don't know. Is that what it is called? Sander clothes?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 Whatever. Even though there's no chimney, but something is delivered to me.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 This is here, like three things that I'm going to open. Open! Wow! This is...

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 Look at this!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 Wow! Thank you. This is really... Look at this!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 Wow! This is true. And then as well as this. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 This is, again, and it is... Do you remember the "Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence"?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.350
 And many of you know that. This is... That we revised it, revised the version of the "Ceaseless

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.800
 Echoes",

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 and that walked by very much with great effort for a long time. Our Andrew.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.360
 Andrew walked on this and added a lot of... A lot of... Let's call it. A lot of clarifications and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.800
 glossaries.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 And we have very nice glossary that can have easy understand of this book. And as well as others,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 too, is really one of these.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.350
 And then this is the photo, of course, both of us came between myself, that many, like Lorraine and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 others,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 like they thought this photo is good because this is the photo talking in the Wachowspig mountain,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 where the Buddha keep these teachings of that. And then this backside also,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 this photo is on the Wachowspig mountain. I think maybe at the years ago,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 when you and him, we both went there, somebody told us, so this is what the...

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 That "Bhanyaparam of the Ceaseless Echoes".

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 And then this is, again, Cynthia walked so hard. He's been so kind and have so many booklets.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 [Applause]

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 Books and the booklets, and this is one of those garland, what's called here,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.800
 is a practice guide for the contemplation of the poor thought that turned the mind from the samsara

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.800
,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.800
 and opening the door of the Dharma trailer series, and this is the fourth.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 And the jewel, like Bhungma, thank you. Thank you very much, Cynthia, and thank you very much,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 Angel,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 and thank you very much, Lorraine, and Chakra, and Laya, and then Sandy, and they walked so hard.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 And Sandy, and metal knots, right? Metal knots. And really on these things, all this to bring this.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.350
 And so I'm so grateful and thankful, so many Sangha members are helping us to bring up all these so

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.800
 many books,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 and I believe, and Ken will mention that too many times, because I believe these books will help,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 because it really will stay there, the same line in the course of the Buddha teaching,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 and what great monks have taught, there's nothing that we've made up anything for the suitable kind

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 of some course in that.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800
 But it's all in really the Buddha line of the Buddha teaching.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.640
 So therefore, it's been a nugget of gold, the Buddha teaching, Buddha teaching being a nugget of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 gold,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 in which, personally, you are in the past, it is in prison, it will be future,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.790
 and therefore, it's a small contribution to those who practice it, or who enters down the Dharma,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.800
 so that more understands.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.800
 And I'm so grateful and so thankful to all of your help and support, and this is what I'm saying.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 Thank you, Ken. Thank you.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 Thank you.
