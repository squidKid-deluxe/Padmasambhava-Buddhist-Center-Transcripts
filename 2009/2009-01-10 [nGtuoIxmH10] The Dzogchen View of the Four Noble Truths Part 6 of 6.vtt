 [END PLAYBACK]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.460
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.120
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.920
 And now, so therefore, again, this motivation is so important.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 And motivation is really the turning point.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.580
 Motivation is like just the key point, key point.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.160
 And therefore, this kind of igniting all the goodness

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.040
 thought and goodness intention always

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.480
 is so important because that is not just important.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240
 It's self is practice.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.400
 That is heart of the practices, essence of the practices.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.560
 And we're talking about the hundo, the beginner preparations

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.280
 or the foundation practices.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.000
 What's it?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 In the always teaching said, bring more joy, more appreciation,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.200
 more kindness, compare your thoughts for all the living

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.080
 beings, more bodhic than that thought.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.600
 Also reflecting all this kind of situation and circumstances,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.760
 no more preciousness, more kind of happy,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.160
 more appreciative of these things.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 And the same kind where we are, what we are,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.640
 is also not this permanent, it's this kind of reflecting

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.800
 truly as it is where things are and kind of softening

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.600
 our grasping and clinging.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.240
 Because grasping and clinging is regimented, is diluted.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.840
 It is not natural.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.080
 And there's a hindrance, obstacles,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 order to kind of like pre-that.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.960
 Again, we have to use the same remedy and the thought

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.520
 as like homopedic things.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.880
 That mind created things, we have

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 to use the mind's techniques.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800
 Love and kind is a comparison.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.840
 It's the homopedic, in a way, techniques

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.640
 to remove the ego and all this negative emotion, which

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 is created by the mind itself.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.720
 So therefore, all this teaching said

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.040
 how much important in the teaching at the foundation.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.240
 And then also principle body of the practice,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.520
 again, maintaining the same, that motivation,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.600
 the mundo of the foundation practices,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.240
 but then more strong, more kind of continually,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.480
 of keeping that flame, that fire.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 And that is known as then the main part of the body

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.600
 practices.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 And then the result will be that as we started the foundation,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.640
 as we continue to maintain, when you discover that,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640
 is then the result in achievement.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 Then, all that.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.320
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:30.680
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 And so therefore, this cause and condition

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.960
 looks like so sometimes insignificant.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.880
 But however, the cause and condition is so important.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.520
 Even the smallest things can bring a huge, big result,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.280
 whether that is negative, whether that is positive.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.840
 So therefore, being as the practitioners,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.400
 we're trying to really learn more kind of positive things

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.560
 and trying to also avoid even the smallest negative actions.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.280
 And that is then good for us, good for the others,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.120
 and good for our continued growth of the practice,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.200
 or practice, or the dharma.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.160
 And for those reasons in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.000
 for example, like six parametas, when

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.320
 we do generous practices, of course, generous practice

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.080
 is so important, so special.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.560
 Everybody knows that.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.160
 But generous practice also brings

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.560
 more abundance of luxuries in the teaching system,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.200
 when you do the generous practices.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.640
 And then, when we do the morality practice,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.280
 the ethic practices, it will bring more always joy,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.160
 happiness, happiness, and particularly in the future,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520
 in the future lives.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.880
 For example, generous practice make more reach.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.440
 And the morality practice, we make

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.440
 us to take bone in higher realms, always.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.920
 And the patient tolerance practices,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.840
 it makes ourselves more--

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.440
 also in the future, it makes more beautiful.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.560
 Or in the future lives, it makes physical very beautiful,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.320
 the morality, the patient practices.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.880
 And the joy of our practices will

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.560
 make kind of very dominating in the future lives,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.680
 in the teaching set.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.120
 It will bring more dominating, more kind

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.120
 of powerful persons, that.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.440
 And then the concentration practice also

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.320
 will bring in future result, as like very calm and peaceful,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.440
 more kind of peaceful state of mind.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.040
 And then wisdom will bring always wisdom, intelligence,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.520
 to our heart, mind, or the Buddhahood, finally.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.120
 And of course, all of that finally brings the Buddhahood.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.360
 So all the achievement--

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.000
 so those are the teaching often said.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.920
 And therefore, again, we're trying to kind of do as much

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.280
 as we can do those six part of mental practices.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.640
 Or even the smallest, the minimum kind of goodness activity

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.440
 that we do.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.720
 And then we could also really harp in the joy each time

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.440
 when we're able to do kind of--

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.920
 igniting that joy and appreciation

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.560
 at the same time, kind of like sit, in a way,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.160
 kind of like sit forward, that may I

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.120
 be able to do this even more in a future kind of way,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.560
 inspiring one's own self, moving continuing the path

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.640
 and progress.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.400
 And that is really known as the practicing the dharma.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.640
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:42.160 --> 00:08:00.560
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.080
 And therefore, always be thoughtful is very important.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.240
 Thoughtful and start with the small, minimum.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.600
 We're not going to looking always the big gigantic things

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.680
 immediately.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.640
 But even the minimum, the smallest

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.520
 is the relief foundation.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.680
 From there, everything started.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.440
 And therefore, kind of very thoughtful,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.280
 do the even smallest good activity that adds up

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.880
 and that build up that.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.640
 And we're not going to wait for big things.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.080
 And big things that we can do, that's great.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.880
 But do what we can do with joy, with appreciation.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.040
 And those are always in the teaching

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.760
 said, which is very practical way.
