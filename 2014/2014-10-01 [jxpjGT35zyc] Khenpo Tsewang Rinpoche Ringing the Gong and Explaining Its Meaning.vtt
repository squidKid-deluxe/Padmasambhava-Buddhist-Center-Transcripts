00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 [bell]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [bell]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 [bell]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Sir?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 [laughter]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Nice.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 You have a bigger and bigger sound, right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yeah, bigger one, really bigger one.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And then of course, sometimes they make it easy to handle here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 So I can't remember.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Maybe this side, but a little thicker.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 And so when you do this, I don't know this exactly.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 But other than when you do that, really it makes a big nice sound.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 This is, as we said the other day, is...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Gas tank?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Oxygen tank.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Well, Khenpo, you just called out the Walton Volunteer Fire Department.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 [laughter]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 You can see that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 They're coming.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 They're coming.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 You go first.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I'll stop on the road.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 No, don't stop.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 [laughter]

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 [laughter]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Thank you, everyone.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Thank you, thank you.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 [laughter]

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And as I said the other day, this is what I said here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Four things.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 For all the beneficial activities that are good for the teaching and all the beings.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And so this is may increasing, or that increase, may everything increase.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 May increasing the longevity, wealth, prosperity, peace, and happiness.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And may increasing in the harmony of the Sanghas, Sangha members.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And then may increasing Buddha's teaching, like the scriptures and the realizations.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So those are the prayers of this.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Thank you.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 [applause]

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Thank you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 What?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That's it, once in a day.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 [laughter]

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Otherwise they're tired.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 They're going to retire soon, so we don't want to retire soon.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 [laughter]

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Thank you, everyone, have a good day.
