00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 All right, it is like according to Dzogchen for the international level technology, bodhijattas,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 bodhijattas.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.640
 How is it here? I mean that you have this sadhana and translate it.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 Some sadhana are pre-moduleed pure and as a pure Buddha village.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.240
 In order to realize this, I developed bodhijattas.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.240
 So this is bodhijattas, two lines of bodhijattas.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.460
 Now I talk really again, of course we all know that bodhijattas are not something new things I am

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.720
 going to talk about.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.400
 But in a way it is reminding to each other and that is our practices.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 Bodhijattas need to be reminded to all the time to us.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 Even somebody is not reminding to you, we should remind ourselves of bodhijattas.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.300
 If we do that, what is known as mindfulness, we will be making, we will improve, we will restate

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.840
 that.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.560
 We will glorify, we will repolish into ourselves. That is mindfulness.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 The benefit of mindfulness is in our scientists in this country or the world, everyone is talking

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 now quite good amount of mindfulness.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.450
 Even in the personess levels, how much they talk. So therefore it is reminding and we remind this,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 it is a reminder of the bodhijattas.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.680
 That means a reminder of love and compassion. Versatile is a super mind for us, really.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 Thinking of love, compassion, relaxing on that state of nature, that state of mindfulness is a big

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.600
 powerful, big benefit for anybody.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.400
 So therefore it is reminding, it is more important. So therefore again essence of the bodhijattas

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.520
 is love.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:10.490
 In the great Master, the master, Madhir said, Madhir said, has two, two, with compassion,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.280
 developing the bodhijattas, with compassion, developing the bodhijattas.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.280
 So that means, and then again Gurbam Masambha said, is teaching on the Lamanpuri Cheepunga.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 Graduation, a dual hip of the graduation path. Part is the Gurbam Masambha is teaching.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 And there Gurbam Masambha said, love and compassion, Muslims are the Buddha mind.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 They are the Buddha mind. That means, love is Buddha, compassion is Buddha and wisdom is Buddha.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 When you develop that, you are in enlightened states. That's what we live in Gurbam Masambha said.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 So therefore, particularly when we develop compassion, again it teaches all the bodhijattas.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.940
 If we summarize the bodhijattas, to kind of bring down to the one single state, what is bodhijattas

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.280
?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.280
 Bodhijattas is compassion. It's a compassion. Essence of bodhijattas is compassion.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 And a compassion to home, to all the living beings, to all the living beings without any discrim

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.280
inations.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:31.280
 That wisdom is completely connected, oh sorry, that compassion is completely connected with wisdom.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.700
 Wisdom, when we have the compassion, according to the teaching, it brings the great wisdom, smart

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.280
ness, intelligence.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.280
 Because when we have compassion, our mind is more calm and peaceful.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.280
 And therefore, there is no kind of like blockage of that.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.810
 And the wisdom, nature of the mind or the awareness shines so beautifully, and the wisdom comes

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.280
 together with compassion.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.280
 So, for that reason, Grand Master Mathieu said that.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.280
 And bodhijattas is benefit for all living beings, and with wisdom, then develop the bodhijattas.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 That means, you will have to benefit to help with all the living beings.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.280
 But in order to fully belong to help with the living beings, you have to get more strength.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.080
 For instance, even if we want to help with all the beings, we don't have the really calm ability to

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.280
 help with everyone's.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.280
 Everyone's. It's just a good heart.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.010
 So not just a good heart, if we like to more actively help with the beings, then you should become

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.280
 the Buddha.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 Get enlightened.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.860
 So therefore, by the comparison in the teachings, by the comparison of the focus to all the living

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.280
 beings,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.280
 by the wisdom, you are more projecting to the enlightenment.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 All focus on enlightenment.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 Enlightenment.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 Why? Because let's benefit, help with the beings.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.280
 So therefore, developing bodhijattas.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.280
 Bodhijattas is then benefit for all living beings.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.280
 Anyway, develop the bodhijattas, as you all know, to bodhijattas.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 We have the biggest attempt and the real truth.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 Wishing bodhijattas, actualizing bodhijattas.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.280
 And then, firstly, sincerely concerning thought, comparing it to all living beings.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.540
 Then we use kind of a way that is a little bit more kind of a highlighter of the qualities, those

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.280
 are known as the poor, boundless, you all.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.280
 Bondless love, boundless compassion, boundless words.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:56.280
 Equals and boundless equinivities, those are the poor, boundless.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.280
 Why is called boundless?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.280
 Because many reasons is known as is boundless.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.280
 Because generally, when you think of the loving-kindness, there is no boundless.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.280
 Our love has no boundless. True love.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 Only ego met the boundless.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.280
 Grasping met the boundless.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.280
 Similarly, compassion has no boundless.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.280
 Rejoice or joy has no boundless.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.280
 And the equanimity has no boundless.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.280
 For that reason is called boundless.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.280
 Then another reason of the body is called boundless because power of is boundless.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.280
 Benefit is boundless.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:58.280
 Our love is boundless or benefit, result is boundless.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280
 And similarly, compassion, joy, equanimity.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 That benefit is so powerful, so is boundless, it can't measure.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 Even the greatest teacher, Balajiak Devani said, he can count every drop of the oceans.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.280
 Overcomes, but cannot count pure power, pure compassion.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.280
 So, the power of that, he cannot count.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:34.280
 Even Buddha said, has no, no, the limitless powers, boundless powers.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:43.280
 They, how much, how, where that power is going is also boundless.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:54.280
 All the beings, beings of six realms, is going to thus all beings.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.280
 And that being has a limitation, boundaries.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:07.280
 According to Buddha's teaching, there is no boundaries, no numbers, boundless beings.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:16.440
 So boundless compassion or boundless bodhicata and boundless power and outreach into the boundless

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.280
 beings.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.280
 That is what is called boundless.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.280
 In other words, subject is boundless, object is boundless or limitless.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.280
 That's really how it is.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 So, when we think of this bodhicata, or love and compassion, then you know how powerful it is.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.280
 There are so many beautiful stories that you know.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.930
 The power of love and compassion, purify their obscuration, disease, sickness, heal, and achieve

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.280
 the highest realization.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.280
 So, one up and up, really did, so many beautifuls.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.580
 Even in the teachings, the life story of the Buddha chapter, many, many years of going traveling to

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.280
 the jungle,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.280
 there are so many pours and snacks and all that, but when you meditate or be in loving kindness,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 all those pours and snacks become not edited, become calm, and the Buddha works beautifully.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.280
 That is how powerful it is.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:27.430
 Then in the story of the new old man, the Maiti-ness, he is trying to meet or see the Buddha Maiti-

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.280
ness.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.280
 So many years, one after another, he couldn't really practice.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.280
 In very later he did, he couldn't read.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.280
 And I think he called it the teaching.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.280
 For 12 years, he couldn't really see even good signs of the dreams, but even in practice,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.280
 the great Master Asaengar, who was predicted by Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.280
 that Master practicing Maitriya to be behold in the Dzimod teachings,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:10:01.280
 for 12 years, he didn't got even signs, good signs, big signs.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:09.280
 But because of his compassion, compassion, so strong, compared to the old sicknesses of God,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:18.080
 that moment, because of that, Maitriya appeared right in front of him as glowing sun in front of

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.280
 the Asaengars.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 That has power of the compassion.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.280
 Instantly purified, whatever the blockage that he is not beholding the Maiti-ness,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.280
 is instantly turned on, purified and behold.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.280
 That's how it is.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.280
 It is so many.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.280
 And then, of course, the most powerful to put in Kavai, the Obscureture,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.280
 accumulated in Maitriya, is a Maitriya.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:53.280
 For that reason, the great Master Asaengar said,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.280
 "If you have one thing, you will get enlightenment without any doubt.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.280
 If you don't have one thing, you will not get enlightenment,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.280
 no matter how many practices or skills and techniques you receive.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.280
 What is that technique?

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.280
 One thing is, if that is bodhicam."

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.280
 So therefore, I pay homage to the bodhicam.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.280
 I pay respect for homage, mostly to the bodhicam.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 And the great Master Asaengar did this, his famous teachings,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:34.280
 at the beginning of his famous teaching, he wrote what he said.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:40.280
 He said, "I posted to the compassion."

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 He said, "Why?"

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.280
 He said, "Because where the bodhisattvas come from, because of compassion.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.280
 Where the bodhisattvas come from, from bodhisattvas."

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.280
 So jumping down to how the Buddha can become Buddha, because of his compassion.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 Therefore, I homemade you, I posted to compassion.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.280
 That is what he said.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.280
 Therefore, this compassion is not just a selected group of heads.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.280
 We all have that today.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.280
 That's why the great teacher of bodhicam said,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.280
 "Every living being has equally Buddha nature."

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.280
 "Everyone has love, everyone has a compassion, everyone has a wisdom."

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.280
 So if we highly like to glorify and move forward with that qualities,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 then enlightenment is right here, right here.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.280
 So that is the general kind of way.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 Then there is the wishing bodhicata connected with the actualizing bodhicata.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.280
 And the actualizing bodhicata,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.280
 then again there is many, many actualizing bodhicata.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.280
 I did not recall it, but there are so many ways.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.280
 But summarizing in the six paramatas by the great Buddha Shakyam,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.280
 the six paramatas, those are really actualizing bodhicatas.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.280
 So those are the generositys, the self-centered paramatas,

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.280
 generositys, morality, and then the patience,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.280
 then the effort, then the concentration, and then the worship.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.280
 Those are the six paramatas.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.280
 Each of those, whatever we do with bodhicata,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.280
 it becomes the actualizing bodhicata.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.280
 And then, for example, our practice meditation is also the actualizing bodhicata

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.280
 because it is concentration, it is the wisdom practice.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.280
 And we kind of activate our bodhicata more,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.280
 and in practice it becomes one of the powerful, actualizing bodhicata practices

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.280
 and concentration and meditation.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.280
 Each concentration, six paramatas is also not completely isolated from six individuals.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.280
 Each has all six of those, six of those in bodhic.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.280
 So all that really is wonderful, beautiful.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.280
 Then through that we get enlightenment.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280
 And with those are the general understanding of the bodhicata.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.280
 And now particularly understanding, or particularly this bodhicata,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.280
 and according here.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.280
 And again, this is the inner thought level for the zouki level.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.280
 In the zouki level, everything is pure, pure.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:27.280
 In the zouki or inner thought level, in the absolute level, everything is pure.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:34.280
 Relative root, everything is pure, both relative and absolute pure.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.280
 In the Mahayava thinking or setting, on the absolute or relative level,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.280
 everything is a three wager status.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.280
 On the absolute level, that all is emptiness.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.280
 All economic status is emptiness.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.280
 Even in the three wager status, there is nothing substantial, solid, existent.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.280
 It is all great economic status.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.280
 Absolute and relative are equally same status.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 There is nothing, there is no individual absolute is here, relative is here.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 Both are in the body.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.280
 So relative level is three wager status.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.280
 And absolute status is totally economic status of the great emptiness.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.280
 That is the how it is.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.280
 And that is also our mind is totally that status.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 And therefore, all the poems and songs and spits, everything is pure and existent.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:39.280
 So for that reason here, say, samsara, nirvana, primodulity, pure.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.280
 And that is again more highlight, if I say, in Goyagar, what the other one says.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.280
 All poems are enlightened.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.280
 Five skandhas, five aggregate is the five buddhas.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.280
 Five element is the five human buddhas.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.580
 One day Goyagar said again, even as Buddha tried to look something that is not enlightened, not

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.280
 going to find.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.280
 Buddha never pwned anything is not enlightened.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.280
 Everything is enlightened.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.280
 Then why we don't see?

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:24.280
 Because the cadence of the dualities, grasping, block that region, that will, due to our grasping.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.280
 Clinging.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.280
 That is what we get in more kind of grasping, thick clings and emotions.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:38.280
 And bouncing back and forth, just always kind of tingled with that emotions we are.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.280
 Then we have a lot of food.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.280
 Ego is narrow mind.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.280
 Grasping is narrow mind.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.280
 And duality is narrow mind.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.280
 Then it makes everything narrow, narrow and narrow.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.280
 And we call it ourself.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.280
 By ourself.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.280
 Ourself.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.280
 We don't see the panoramic purity view as it is.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.280
 Reality level, it is pure.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.280
 Pure.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.280
 Our mind is pure.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.280
 Our poems are pure, everything.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:21.580
 And then of course you all know those in the read like books, so that the samsara and the nirvana

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.280
 is pure.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 And the samsara and nirvana is just like when we are all in duality, that is called samsara.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.280
 When you are free from the duality, then the samsara is nirvana.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:39.930
 For that reason, the great master, again, K.D. Pardek, when he talked about what the master, great

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.280
 master, Maharaja says.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.280
 What is the distinction of the samsara and nirvana is dualities.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:55.280
 When duality is or grasping is dissolved, that moment, samsara and nirvana are merged.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 Merged, there is no difference.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.280
 No difference.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.280
 That is what really it is.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.280
 So it is pure, it is completely pure.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.280
 Part of that beautiful status.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 In order to break that realization, that is what it is.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 But those people, such as we all, the beings of six realms, they don't have that realization.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:27.280
 They are struggling with their own creations, their own emotions, which is created by themselves.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.280
 They are bouncing, they are going to nightmares of their own nightmares.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.280
 And they all experience that.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.280
 And therefore, I am going to make strong courage and confidence and commitment.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.280
 I am going with that realization to benefit all three beings.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.280
 So that is really known as bodhicchara in the breathing.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.280
 That is the absolute state of talking bodhicchara.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.280
 The reality level is a perfect view, but Santhi means not realizing that.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.280
 In order to break that realization, I am going to develop the bodhicchara.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.280
 Love and inspiration onboard each other.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.280
 So that.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.280
 And how long will we take that bodhicchara?

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.280
 That is known as bodhicchara, until we become neutral.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.280
 We take over.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.280
 Then, not just only that, but according to the teaching,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.280
 until the same beings, all are completely enlightened.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.280
 Until we keep this bodhicchara.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.280
 And those are known as shipper-like bodhicchara.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.280
 Shipper-like.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.280
 According to the teaching, I am not according to the teaching,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.280
 in the samsara, but how they do it.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.280
 That sisra is shipper when they are completely grudged,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.280
 grudged in the old animals or yap curves.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.280
 When they put the perfectly safe places of the old animals,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.280
 then finally they rest.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.280
 They relax.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.280
 Similarly, those great bodhisattvas, such as mijujiri,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.280
 ava-lokidihara, vedya-bani, jata-ga-naukanyam, poussai-nyam,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.280
 all those, bodhisattvas, they are like untranscented beings.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.280
 They are going to continue to be as bodhisattva.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.280
 Untranscented beings reach enlightenment.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.280
 They continue to be as great bodhisattva,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.280
 to benefit, to help, to outreach to every living beings.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.280
 That is about the duration of bodhicchara.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.280
 I said that until enlightenment,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 bodhicchara is until we keep that coordinate in the commitment,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.280
 until every living being has become the bodhicchara,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.280
 and discovered and nurtured.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.280
 So that is the brili about bodhicchara.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.280
 Bodhicchara, and I will stop here,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.280
 and if you have some questions, please discuss.
