00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 Thank you. Warm greetings again, friends. Thank you. We'll begin as we always begin and reactivate

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 our bodhichitta. This is the one thing that we always, it's kind of the essential point

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.120
 of Dharma. So it's the answer, really honestly, the answer to every question is bodhichitta.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.720
 And then it's just a matter of unpacking how that's true. So with that kind of very clear

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.600
 understanding, the exceptional importance of bodhichitta will all just kind of activate

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.060
 that heart and mind of enlightenment, the genuine concern and care for all beings, and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.760
 the wish that what we're doing right now becomes the immediate direct cause of every being's

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.360
 happiness and their enlightenment.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:35.400
 Thank you. So the kind of theme that I was kind of orienting around the past couple days

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:45.920
 for this specific time together was painting a fuller picture. So painting a fuller picture.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.160
 And then specifically, I was thinking about painting a fuller picture of ourselves, and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.500
 then also a fuller picture of Dharma. And then I think specifically as I was looking

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.960
 at it and kind of feeling through it, and it was more kind of emphasized the fuller

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.240
 picture of oneself, of me. And I think one way to put this or one way I've thought of

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.040
 it is just we all have these many selves. We all have a plurality of selves. We take different

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 roles. We have different moods. We show up in different ways at different times. We have

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.040
 different talents that come out, different limitations that we have, different ways we

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.240
 get stuck at certain times. We have the sleepy me and the anxious me and the excited me and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 the relaxed me and the Dharma me and the non-Dharma me and the friendly version of me. And we

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.440
 have all these aspects to ourselves. So it's kind of how do we actually kind of lean into

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.640
 really like allowing them to be there more fully, have a fuller sense of self, of me.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.840
 So to allow for a more plurality of selves. And then specifically related to this point,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.040
 many of us know like no self is such a key essential Dharma teaching and the foundational

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:28.240
 teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni. And I think the way that I understand this some is it's

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.840
 no fixed self. There's no fixed me. There's no one me. There's no essential identity that

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.840
 is me. There's no one way I am. I'm a fluid. Like everything is fluid. It's interdependent.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.160
 It's dependently arisen. And we all are and we keep changing. And this is something that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.880
 is like kind of a common understanding in one way, but it's so deep. I mean, they say

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.040
 to really understand interdependence is to understand emptiness. To understand emptiness

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:12.680
 is to actually achieve freedom. So how can we allow for a greater plurality of selves,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.040
 a greater flexibility of selves. And two things that kind of came to mind with this for myself

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.320
 as I was kind of going through this a little bit is, and this is I thought of like some

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.960
 little points that have helped me and also kind of came to mind. One is like we're all

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.880
 human. The humanness of me. Right. We have to allow that to be a part of this process

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:53.480
 of Dharma. I'm a human being. The humanness. I have all kinds of limitations and prejudices

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.740
 and preferences and beautiful things and things I don't want to be aware of and things that

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.320
 I shy away from, but they're part of me. And it's just because I'm human and we're all

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 just human. And so that's one side humanness. We all have limitations. We are relative beings

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:28.840
 or limited. And then on the other side, we all have an unlimited nature. And the Buddha

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.200
 taught this so clearly and all the teachings in Buddhism, like really come to this point

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:44.120
 that we all have this unlimited, unrestricted, inherently flexible capacity to allow for

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.860
 anything to happen. Like it's totally accommodating. This awareness that's utterly flexible and

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.760
 free that we all have this unlimited awareness, this unlimited intelligence and this goodness

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:05.160
 that is bodhicitta. That is the Buddha nature. So in thinking about or like feeling through

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.800
 like this really a plurality of selves or like allowing myself to show up in like different

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.540
 ways, depending on what's happening in my experience and who's around me and what's

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.400
 helpful now and what's not. These are two things that I always have to kind of keep

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.980
 checking in on. Like they're two things that help me to not get so lost down kind of in

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.200
 some kind of fixation, some kind of holding too tightly is that I'm a human being with

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.220
 limitations that I'm human. And two, I have an unlimited nature that goes beyond any kind

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.760
 of identity or sense of me that I could ever conceive of or ever feel or ever imagine.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:53.180
 I mean, it's really inconceivable. And these two aspects are always at play. They're always

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:03.240
 part of the nature of relative interdependence. And so that's two things. If we like allow

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.440
 ourselves to have both those sides or both those aspects to kind of, you know, to show

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.160
 up in one way as we are, but not be totally defined by those roles we take because then

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:22.720
 we're fixating on a certain me. And also to like, you know, to really check in and like

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.400
 the main point is to come to experience this unlimited nature that we all have, this utterly

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.800
 flexible. It's the no fixed part of the no self. It's like unfixed or flexible. And we

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.760
 have both of these aspects. So in terms of the ways of actually like fully engaging with

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.680
 the Dharma, I think that's really important to allow ourselves to have both those things.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:57.240
 Because if we cut out the human part, then we're all just pretending. And if we cut out

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.020
 the unlimited nature part, then it gets so tight, so fast. And it's just too serious.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:11.760
 And there's no levity. And there's no like tenderness to it. It's just so tense. Always

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.280
 just freedom, freedom, freedom, breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthrough. On the other side

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.640
 of it's all just like my feeling right now and what's in my body right now. And what

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.880
 happened to me last week and those, we have to care about those. But if we get too wrapped

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.800
 around those two, then we lose the bigger perspective. We don't allow ourselves more

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.200
 room to change. We constantly circle around a certain story, a certain set of identities,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.080
 a certain kind of set of me's. And that's so limited compared to like actually our unlimited

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:55.200
 nature. And so then we go to look at the Dharma with this. How is the Dharma is not, you know,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:02.720
 we can really think of it as a plurality of dharmas. It's always Buddhisms. It's always

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:15.880
 multiple. There's not just one Buddhism. It's Buddhisms. And we've heard this so many times

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.440
 and it's such a, in one way, kind of obvious teaching because it's been repeated so much.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.920
 But there's so many yanas and there's so many techniques and there's all these vehicles

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:32.120
 and there's all these views. And there's all these ways that we engage the views with meditation

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.000
 and with our behavior and conduct. And we get a certain very specific result or fruition

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.640
 that corresponds with that sequence of view, meditation, conduct and fruition. But the

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:52.680
 Dharma itself is so flexible. And it's almost like we've talked about this and we've heard

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.480
 teachings about this so much that it's almost like we don't really have to say more because

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.880
 it's so, there's just so many teachings on this foundational Buddhism and Sutra Mahayana

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.480
 Buddhism and Tantra Mahayana Buddhism and Zogchen and all these lineages and all the

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.400
 ways that we can like release our holding. There's so many ways and they always have

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:21.080
 to correspond to the way we're holding, the way we're stuck. And that's where the plurality

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.680
 of dharmas, the multiplicity of dharmas, the really infinite ways that the Dharma expresses

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.900
 itself and the unlimited ways that the Buddha so kindly taught us to help us get free of

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:40.720
 our holding, our fixation, our fear to be a little more inclusive, a little more open.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.480
 So there's so many ways that the Buddha so kindly pointed out how we can do this to relax

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.040
 certain kind of grasping. But it's always related to the type of grasping we actually

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:58.080
 are happening, that's happening with us right now. It's not related to someone else's grasping

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.160
 or to my grasping five years ago. It's always where we work, where we apply the teaching

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.880
 is always right now. And that's where the plurality of selves and the plurality of Dharma,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.800
 the flexibility of self, the flexibility of mind, the flexibility of the teachings to

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:24.760
 have a more open mind, that's where they come together in what actually helps right now.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.020
 So how am I showing up right now? How does the Dharma like meet that like a medicine or

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:37.680
 like a kind friend or like a, you know, there's all kinds of ways that we can release our

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.280
 tension, our fixation, our kind of limited ways of just holding in a set kind of pattern.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.800
 And it always comes down to right now, this present moment. So I thought I was thinking,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.960
 what are some ways, you know, if they're all these selves and each of us are just, we're

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:03.390
 so rich, we're so kind of, it's extraordinary how diverse we are, each of us. And it's

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.080
 extraordinary

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.240
 how multifaceted the Dharma is, the teachings of the Buddha. So like what are some ways

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.760
 that we can like let ourselves keep coming back to these points to let ourselves be human

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.200
 and be unlimited and to meet the Dharma in this present moment in a way that really kind

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.120
 of like lines up and helps us open, helps us release, helps us relax just a little more.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:37.320
 And the one point I came to and this isn't like in a systematic way, but was just digestion.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.840
 Contemplation is digestion. Venerable Kempo Sowendong and Rinpoche talks about it often

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:51.800
 as absorbing the teachings. It really takes time to absorb these teachings. It takes long

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.760
 time and it's so rewarding and it's so valuable and so worth it. And I'm sure all always in

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.640
 our visualizations, the Buddhas are just rejoicing that we're doing this process, that we're

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.440
 engaging on the path. They're always so happy. You know, it's never we visualize the Guru

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.040
 Rinpoche in the sky above scowling at us saying you're so bad. How can you do this wrong?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.440
 Your visualization is so horrible. Would you do that yesterday and all that? They always

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.960
 look with such kindness and such love. Like it's like an only child, like, oh, you're

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:36.480
 doing it, you know. Keep going. There's this whole kind. And it just takes time. It takes

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.400
 time to digest things. It takes time to absorb the Dharma. It takes time to release these

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:49.240
 habits. That's a really, it's just good for myself to keep coming back to that. This is

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:56.320
 a long process and it's so rewarding and worth it. Every, every step into opening to become

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:05.960
 a little more flexible, a little more attentive to others, like it's only going to be beneficial.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:15.400
 But the process is sticky because our habits are sticky. You know, otherwise they would

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.280
 just dissolve and disappear. The habits would be gone, you know, but even if in Vajrasattva

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.840
 purifies us entirely, then, you know, the habits just pop back on. We're like totally

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.600
 relieved of all the habits we recognize and release and we're in our unlimited nature.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.780
 And then we get sleepy or we just think a thought comes and emotion comes and then they

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:43.960
 all just line up again. Our, our fixation is really sticky. And so many things out there

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:50.240
 are very sticky and they're asking us to stick more, you know, grab me, look at me, watch

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.840
 me, use me, eat me, buy me, stay with me, engage with me. They're wanting to just draw

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.400
 us in, draw us in, draw us in. So it's a, it's a very kind of involved process to just

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:07.460
 relax and be like, oh, I see that happening. I see the invitation, but no, thank you. It's

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:14.560
 okay. I'm good. I'm going to kind of rest with what's happening right now and not immediately

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:23.400
 kind of grab onto the yummy treat or whatever it is, push away the really scary thing. So

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.640
 that's what we're practicing in meditation to let what's happening happen. And then it

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.280
 changes and then it becomes a different thing and then let that happen. And it just keeps

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:39.580
 changing. And so then that's kind of the practice we keep kind of like letting all this multipl

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.240
icity

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.440
 kind of happen. The waves come and the waves go, and that's just the path. So we should

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.600
 kind of allow, it's good to know that's, you know, that's what's going to happen. It can

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.840
 be a good just heads up to see that. And if that keeps happening, then good. Then we just,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.600
 as long as we keep relaxing and kind of keep getting a little more tender, more soft, more

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:08.200
 clear, then just keep at it. And because this process takes a long time, then a second point

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:16.440
 I thought is we really need protection. These habits are so sticky. We need to be really

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:24.920
 practical in creating really a safe space around us in our environment, in our minds

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.880
 that really help us keep this digestion process happening. We really need these, whatever

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.080
 you call it, boundaries or a space that we go to, that we do these certain type of activities

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.920
 like meditation or studying Dharma, like retreat hermitages or a little spot in your home where

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:50.880
 you just doing this process of meditating, that we need this protection. We need the

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.960
 protection circles in Vajrayana Buddhism. It's always part of the sadhana practice. Our

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.480
 shamatha, we need these containers because it's really like we've said before, baby bodhicitta,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.920
 baby rigpa, it's just little babies, you know, we need all these supports. They're just supports

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.440
 and they're secondary supports. We don't have to have them always forever. They change as

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.080
 our own emotions change, as our experience changes, but we require them all the way on

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:23.360
 the path until we're actually totally free and we can actually not kind of lock onto

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.920
 anything that comes up on our radar. We can see it clearly and not lock onto it. Then

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.680
 they said these are totally free beings, you know, these beings on the boomies or they're

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.360
 enlightened beings. But until then we need these secondary supports. That's very practical

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.000
 and that's just essential on the path. That is the path. How do we use these secondary

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.020
 supports that really help us protect this baby bodhicitta, this really genuine good intention?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.920
 What actually helps me in this moment line up with the dharma in a way that like my heart

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.640
 opens a little more, I soften a little bit. I really get a more enthusiasm to practice,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.800
 to actually connect, to be kind, to listen. Those are all secondary supports. We need

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 that protection. This refuge, we need this. There's just no way around it. If we try to

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.480
 talk around it, it's just talk because we're humans with unlimited nature. We're not just

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.760
 unlimited. We have all these limited human habits that come up that are part of our experience

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:32.000
 all the time and we need ways of releasing them. These are the supports we use, protection.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.360
 That's a kind of a, like a point that kind of came to mind with that for me is this vulnerability.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.400
 You're really fickle, you know? The mind is fickle. I'm really fickle and that's really

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:53.520
 the greatest superpower we have. I can be influenced. I can be moved. I can experience

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.320
 something and it can open me and it can make, it can just make this soft, tender, like really

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.640
 curious, engaged experience because I can be influenced, because I'm not locked away

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.790
 in a fortress, you know? Like being vulnerable, letting life affect you. That's such an

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.480
 extraordinary

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.040
 superpower. If we didn't have that, we would really, we wouldn't be relational beings.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.120
 We would just be frozen and stuck. And on the flip side of that, vulnerability is really

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:29.480
 the greatest weakness too, because we can be influenced. And so many things out there

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.680
 are not, they're not encouraging goodness and bodhicitta and loving attention and a

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.840
 sense of gratitude and confidence and inner courage and courageousness and follow through

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:47.320
 and rigorous kind of analytic investigation. Like so much is not encouraging that at all.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.560
 So we have to be really discerning here. That's like where this discerning intelligence is

00:19:51.560 --> 00:20:00.720
 so important. Being open, being tender, being able to be moved by experience. But having

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.640
 really discerning intelligence of what is moving me in a way that's away from Dharma,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.120
 it's away from my nature, it's closing me away from my unlimited potential. It's not

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.560
 a secondary support, it's a primary obstacle. We really have to discern that and we have

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.440
 to ask for help too, because a lot of that's really quiet, subtle stuff that we can't see

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.560
 ourselves doing. So we need these Sangha members, community members, we need these teachers.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.680
 They'll help point these things out to us before we make too big of a mess with them

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:40.760
 and we believe in these obstacles too much. So this vulnerability is so key, but we have

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.880
 to be really discerning with it. We need to be open and share and willing to authentically

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.800
 show up in a really kind of touched way, like a sincere way. But we also need to be real

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.040
 careful about who we're doing that with. What's the context? Because sometimes people won't

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.960
 use that for our benefit. They'll use it to take advantage. So this is not bodhicitta.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:10.040
 Bodhicitta is not doormat compassion, as Venerable Shogym Trung Purimhiche said so many times.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.200
 We're trying to be tender-hearted because it's just a tender experience to be alive.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:21.480
 It's so wounding. It's so wounded. Like it's all suffering, you know. We can be influenced.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.420
 It's uncertain. So it's so vulnerable. It's like, really? We never have enough clothes

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:35.240
 for the wind to be released, for us to be really totally everything's completely perfect.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:41.040
 There's always some little crack in there that makes it not so comfortable, you know?

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.320
 Like the sick person in a bed that can't really get in the right position that Great Master

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:52.600
 Long Champa said. It's just always like that. And because it's not always perfect, that

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.320
 really helps us. That's the opportunity. That's like the superpower of vulnerability. "Oh,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.600
 how can I use this as an experience to open my mind? Because it's not really the way I

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.420
 want it. Oh, how can I use that to actually develop more compassion?" Then this becomes

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:18.540
 a great opportunity. "How do we bring this plurality of me, of selves, and the plurality

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.560
 of Dharma together?" Definitely the main question that comes to my mind is like on the Bodhisattva

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:31.800
 path is what actually serves others right now? That really brings everything to a point.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.440
 What's actually helpful right now? So it's not which self do I want to show up with right

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.040
 now in one way? And which Dharma path do I want to bring right now? It's like actually

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.400
 in this situation with this person or in this circumstance or with my mind, what actually

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:52.480
 helps me connect with my unlimited nature? And in a way that lets me be an embodied being

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.120
 that's relating with experience? What serves? And I thought this, if we don't know what

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:05.200
 serves, because life's so complicated, there's so many things at play. Relationships are

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.920
 very sticky too. If we can't figure out immediately with a lot of clarity what serves right now,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:24.240
 what is most helpful? We can just express love. Just love. Our own Buddha nature just

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:36.440
 knows that. If we're being loved, someone's appreciating us, our Buddha nature just opens.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:44.120
 There's a big doorway here with vulnerability and grief. And it's good, I wanted to say,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.560
 I thought as part of this I really wanted to thank everyone. Some of you may know, my

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:58.320
 mom passed away a couple weeks ago. And it's really, it's just heartbreaking. And so many

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.480
 people, there's been such an outpouring of like so much support and love, love for her,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.260
 love for me, love for my family, and it's been just, I mean, I just couldn't ask for

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:18.360
 more. And it's like some person you, I mean, just love so much. I love my mom so much.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.880
 And what do you say, you know? What do you say when you lose, when someone you care about

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:30.360
 lose something that's so cherished to them? I just love them. It's become really clear

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.840
 in my mind. Perfectly, not perfectly clear, but clear, you know? You know, sometimes we

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.800
 don't have the right words. We don't know what to say. We don't, we're going to stumble

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.000
 and make a mess and make mistakes, but it's just if we come from a place of love, like

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.940
 really concerned, oh really, it's so tough. This is so hard. Life is so hard. It's so hard

00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:00.560
 to be a human being. I know that. We feel that ourselves, we go through things. Oh, it's

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:12.520
 just so hard sometimes. And then we just love. Oh, I just, I love you. I mean, that's always

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:23.800
 never going to be wrong. So if we can't really clearly know, oh, what really is going to

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:30.680
 help now. Really, we don't have that skill yet. We can just connect to our bodhicitta

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:38.240
 and just turn it on, you know? Oh, I just love you, you know? I love compassion, really.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.600
 This is so tough being a human being. It's so tough. All the Buddhas said, it's so much

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.480
 in my mind. How much we've cried over the loved ones we've lost in the past, it feels

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:54.960
 more than the oceans, our tears. Oh, how we've done this so much. How we've lost things we've

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:03.680
 loved and just really first noble truth, you know? And that's where things like grieving,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:12.200
 it's like such a big doorway. Just a tiny little taste of that now. We're really all

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:20.920
 very vulnerable beings. This human condition we're in is so vulnerable. And it's that way

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:30.840
 for all of us. We all have this suffering. It's just uncertain. Life is uncertain. And

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.240
 in that way, this, that process, that vulnerability, it can be really like such a way to connect

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:47.080
 to others. We're all in the same situation. Wow, it's made so tender. And then the little

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:52.080
 kind of scary element of it is, oh, my suffering is just, we can kind of wrap ourselves. I

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.800
 really have a sense of that a little more than before. Oh, this suffering I can't bear,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.520
 you know? This grief is so big, I can't bear it. And my body just goes into these mows or

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.000
 all these things are coming up. All this sadness and just like, really, it's like this creature

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.200
 I'm like, well, I'm getting to watch. It is in one way funny, but also it's just like,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.720
 I can't do anything about it. And it's just also beautiful. Like, wow, this vehicle that's

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:30.320
 just like designed to, you know, to like care for things and be sad about losing them and

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.000
 having gratitude. Like I didn't have to do anything for it, you know, and my conscious

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.200
 mind I didn't have to do anything to get this body. And then there's all these teachings

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.600
 about past lives. This is such an extraordinary vehicle each of us have. And we've done many,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:55.680
 many good things to produce such a good result. There's more things to say, but we're all

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:03.360
 in this very kind of a, whether we like it or not, it's all a very liminal, fluid, flexible

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.600
 space, just being a human being. And it's just not going to turn out the way we want

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:16.520
 it almost ever. Sometimes we get lucky and it keeps going, we get in a good flow. But

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.480
 it's not really like it lines up according to all of our checklists. It's actually that

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.520
 our mind softens and then we actually start working with what's happening. And then it's

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.640
 like, Oh, this isn't so bad. And then these great beings, they check in and they get so

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.860
 flexible with the nature that they really always are meeting the situation in this present

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.200
 moment with such finesse and such elegance and such power and strength and clarity. It's

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.680
 just so fine tuned and so willing to move as it needs to move as life moves. They're

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.360
 so moved by it and they're really willing to meet it right on the dot. And that's where

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.960
 this plurality of selves and plurality of Dharma avoids just like anything goes pluralism.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:08.000
 It avoids the extreme of extreme relativism. When we're talking about like no fixed self,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.160
 it doesn't mean infinite selves. It's really highlighting the unlimited nature that we

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:23.040
 all have in that experience. It's just part of being a nested being in, in life. It's,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:34.850
 everything's connected. The plurality is pointing to like the openness of mind, the utter

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.600
 flexibility

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:45.080
 of bodhicitta. And then we can show up in any way that's helpful. And it won't be the specific

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:52.720
 way of me that I like the best. It'll be the way that's really helpful right now. And we've

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.360
 seen that with these great bodhisattvas and we've seen that with Buddha and we've seen

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.060
 that with all these Buddhas and that's what they do. They keep showing up in all these

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:08.000
 varieties of ways and we're training ourselves to follow in their footsteps, to be that flexible,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.240
 to show up with two arms or four arms or this color or to show up as a sound or to show

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.560
 up as a memory or like, you know, people have a friend who like really is just so amazing.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.440
 And Chantideva, way of the bodhisattva, may I be a boat, may I be a bridge, may I be a

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.080
 refreshing breeze, may I be medicine, may I be ambrosia, anything that serves other beings.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.280
 And this friend literally thinks of herself as being a bridge that all these Indian beings

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:41.920
 can walk across to get to the other shore. It's so wonderful, that deep level of service.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.080
 Like you really care that much that like, may I be whatever is necessary to be the balm

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:53.560
 that soothes the pain for any being. Such a heart wish. So just extraordinary to be in

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.760
 the company of people like that and it's just so refreshing to be at the feet of these great

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.640
 masters that are that way all the time and to be in a community of practitioners and

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.240
 to be also just a vulnerable human being, part of this vulnerable wounded experience

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:16.340
 and like really to use that as a way to like really let this kind of diversity of experience

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:22.240
 like kind of manifest and like unfurl and let the waves of kind of experience and mind

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:31.080
 to keep happening without getting kind of drowned in them. But like kind of let them

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:39.560
 kind of lift us up and let us really support us. Let the diversity actually keep pointing

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:46.660
 out to like that flexibility, the openness of mind. And that's where all this flexibility

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.280
 of Dharma and the flexibility of self, it all comes to that point. And then that openness

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.120
 of mind, the spaciousness quality of mind that's inconceivable, can't be put into any

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.980
 kind of fixed category, really beyond any kind of fabrication designation, any kind

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:06.480
 of holding pattern. It's completely beyond all those holding patterns. Then that open

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.200
 freedom can express itself in an infinite variety of ways as the Buddha taught as this

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:18.280
 Vajrayana teachings and as Tantramayana is like really renowned for doing the infinite

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.720
 variety of ways of skillful means of connecting with others and communicating in helpful ways

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:36.240
 with bodhicitta. So that's the main point. Using the tenderness to actually connect with

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.840
 the unlimited nature. We're tender and exposed. We can be influenced and moved. And we want

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.720
 to be, we're underwhelmed in a lot of ways. It's not just overwhelming life, overwhelming.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.920
 We're overwhelmed with stuff that doesn't really feed us well. It doesn't bring much

00:32:51.920 --> 00:33:01.200
 nourishment. But we want to be in awe. We want to have the magical, mysterious experience

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.360
 where we're just grateful and we're just like showing up and the simplicity becomes breathtaking.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.760
 We all want to be moved like that. And that openness of mind that actually that's what

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:26.540
 it introduces such an open state of mind that's so freshly engaged and so simple. So may it

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.880
 be so. And we keep using these practices to reintroduce that same openness in our own

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.240
 awareness and then to like really accommodate other beings within that spaciousness like

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.320
 in whatever way really serves them to have them be more open and more loving to themselves

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.360
 and loving to others. And there's a bodhisattva path. And that's the Vajrayana kind of essential

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.240
 point. The heart bodhicitta really is the answer of all these questions. And this is

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:57.640
 just one way to kind of unpack that a little bit. So thank you all. Really love you. Love

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:19.640
 you. Love you. Thank you.
