00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.230
 Thank you. Thank you again, everyone. Thank you very much. You are welcome, everyone. Thank you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.940
 very much.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:22.110
 Again, we will strengthen our motivation. Again, we are activated. And then there are the teachings

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.420
.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.560
 And again, to do teaching, we remember we are not going to forget that what is most important

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.420
 is beautiful motivation that is so important. So therefore, every time in the teaching,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.900
 mentioned to all the time, reminding them to each of us that about mind of the motivations.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.880
 And this motivation is again those three, three motivations, joy and appreciation,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.240
 and vastness, motivation of the bodhicata, and purity, motivation of these Vedayana teachings,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 all the three Vedya states, Vedara form, Vedara song, and Vedara space and mind, those are so, so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.080
 important,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.980
 is crucial. That is the whole, actually practice, our practice, that is our study, that is our

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.160
 meditation.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.370
 So therefore, again, we stand up there between motivation and intention, open, treasured goal of

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.040
 our heart, those.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.330
 And with that, and then we go again with this Jabji Dhunu, teaching. And again, I am just going to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.800
 read the title here,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:45.480
 Heart Otherwise for the Fourteen Ones, by this Balanesh Dhunu, or Jabji Dhunu, this is one of the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.000
 very important,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.800
 simple instruction for all of us. Ask how we like to practice, how we like to practice,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.360
 how we like to get progress, not just practice, progress with practices, that this is the relief

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.520
 instruction. There is also making, there is a full wealth of the practitioners, full wealth.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.560
 You reflect, I mean, all translation, it's the full wealth. Well, we have this full wealth,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.920
 our practice becomes very rich, rewarding, satisfactory, relief fulfillment.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:35.240
 Somehow, amazing is full of treasures, then we get all of the realizations, and bring ourselves,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.480
 not so much fulfillment. So therefore, I mean, this is really, I mean, it's simple, simple,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.200
 very straightforward, direct teaching, direct on our teaching. So really, of course, I will go over

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 this again, and then later on that, but those are really what the teaching says. So therefore,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.480
 always having those beautiful thoughts, then we go to the teaching. Again, with three frames,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.840
 as great master, Omniscient Nungi Bach, highlighted, beginning good, middle good,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.720
 concluding good, and I translated those sometimes good, sometimes noble, but reality it is,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.120
 in a debate, it is tambasan, tambasan, tambam means noble, tambam means vicious,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.400
 tambam means goodness, it's something supreme. So it's three, three novels, three springs,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.880
 three good, excellence, three excellence. We put this frame, our practice in meditation,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.120
 and all become like that. So therefore, again, with that, first, the beginning, noble, is again

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.200
 intention. And thank you with the four renouncer, I can talk, as well as close connection to the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.600
 Buddha Dharma Sangha or the reference, and both each other, and then devotions. Those are

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.480
 beginning good, beginning noble, beginning excellent. This is not just a beginning, then you forget

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.480
,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.280
 this is continuing that, that energy is continuing to the middle, to the concluding, and the third

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:27.320
 stage. With that energy, with that view, with that thought or understanding, then we apply in the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:36.360
 middle, the meditation, the concentrates, whether we chanting practices, meditation, or we silence

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.200
 meditation, all meditation. According to Vaidhyana, Vaidhyana has generated all practices are

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.920
 summarized

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.400
 in the two. The visualization stage, or creative stage of visualization practices,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.920
 complicated stage practice of the disarming stages, that both are the powerful meditation,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.760
 what powerful and very profound, really powerful meditation. So therefore, this meditation,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.600
 with those beautiful intentions, that energy, that thought, the beginning good, we begin to

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.240
 practice

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:24.680
 with meditation, concentrates, and that we again combine in six parama-das. Six parama-das,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.320
 six parama-das encompass entirely Buddha teaching, Buddha practices,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.760
 Buddha's teaching practices, as I said so many times, and you all know that too, too, encompasses

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.000
 everything. In this case today we highlight of the the putt parama-das, dhyana parama-das,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.800
 which is again meditation. It is again practices. What is the essence of the dhyana,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.960
 connotation of the meditation in the teaching state, not destructive, not destructive.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:15.080
 That is simple. One word tells the identity and the nature of the concentrations.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:23.240
 That means not destructive from where you're focusing, but even you're focusing.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.760
 Whether you focus, I call it very energetic, the visualizations, or whether you're focusing

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:39.640
 your mind with the complete stages, not destructive. That is what it is.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.700
 That also means that is samadhi meditation, not destructive. Vibhachana meditation, not destructive

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.840
.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:55.080
 Distraction is mandir. Distraction is duality.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:05.880
 Distraction is update, the busyness of the emotions, mandir conceptions. It carries out us

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:15.800
 from the point, essential point. It completely knocking down us, therefore not distracting.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:24.680
 That is really the essential meaning of the concentrations, or essential nature of the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:32.520
 concentrations, or meditations. So now we've been discussing of the meditation, of this topic,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.080
 called three days. Already we have discussed it, and we came yesterday with the postures.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:46.520
 We discussed about the postures, importance of the postures. Those we discussed. It's not something

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:58.040
 that you only heard yesterday. You all heard and learned so many times from the books, from the

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:06.560
 great masks, one after another. Again, once again, we discussed those, those importance, the post

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.920
ures.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:15.000
 Once you have the good postures, then how to put that in actions now? We also discussed

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:24.200
 breathing purifications. We talked spoke very simple ways. There is more kind of variety way to

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:32.520
 breathing purification exercise. We talked spoke or I spoke very simple ones. And that

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.480
 which is of course, I'm sure you already know those things. But it's cleansing and purifying.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:48.280
 Purify. What we purify, in temporary level, we purify all the emotions, the stress force,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:59.400
 anxieties, that's worryness. Those are we purify. And deep down what we purify

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:08.120
 in the teaching set, all the obscurations, negativities, broken samayas, broken commitments,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:15.000
 that fired up that shadow, that stain, that's fired up that we're cleaning,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.400
 that need to go out. So that means all our system of the body, the channels, the chakras,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:32.120
 are all clairway, that, that stain, that shadow. Therefore, purification, breathing purification

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:40.620
 exercise is very powerful, very important in the teaching making. It is healing, it is rejuvenating

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:40.840
,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:49.800
 it is relaxing, it is calming, and deep down it is cleansing. The very fundamental cause of those

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.840
 all the emotions, obscurations, negative calmness, those really in the teaching set.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:05.480
 So those are we discussed yesterday. Then we discussed the other day about the six conditions,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:13.720
 supporters of meditations. Those are basically the support for not distracting. Basically,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:20.360
 the support for not distracting physically, mentally. Above that, we discussed it,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:27.720
 Kasadeh, or I mentioned, the particular spatial state of the mayana, bodhisattva practitioner,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:36.440
 and a retreat from the self-important attitudes. Self-important. Self-important is,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:44.680
 it's just we, all everyone has, as long as we have the ego clinging, as long as we have the notion

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:53.400
 of the me and you, there is always that attitude comes. And the attitude of self-important is

00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:00.260
 force, that means, I'm not important. You are the second. Even though we don't pronounce that

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.840
 openly,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:08.680
 but that is where line up like that. Find that. See, bodhisattva practitioners and bodhicitta

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:17.240
 practitioners, then they reverse that. That is called only practices, ever use simple word

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.680
 that we all know. So we discussed it there. As much as we can also really bring up that,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.560
 that meaning during our meditation, the practices, even in post-meditation status,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.440
 as much as we can. We're keeping up our practices. We're keeping up the very core of our practices.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:46.040
 So we discussed those. And then we discussed about errors and mistakes of during the meditation,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:54.280
 or before, for the meditation, which meant five of those points, points. And sure, you did this

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.480
 state, and of course, you also know already those. Five of those we went. Five. Then I discussed,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:09.000
 also making the highlight of the five supporters of it, of the meditation. What do we do when we

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.960
 have those obstacles? What kind of antidotes we use? I listed five of them. So now we are in a way,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:30.840
 I mean, as well as my concern about how we went, like talks or these talks or teachings, now we're

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:37.160
 ready to put into the practices meditation, that this time we're going to talk meditation.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.240
 When it comes to meditation, there are two states generally, two meditations.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:50.680
 Those are known as the Samad meditation and Vibhachana meditation. In the teachings said,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.080
 the brain master Kamadhyala said, entirely there, all the meditations of the Buddha teaching can be

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:06.440
 summarized onto these two, two, Samad meditation and Vibhachana meditation. That is really the

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:18.200
 principle, the principle frame of the meditation, Samad meditation, Vibhachana meditation.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:27.160
 And which is first, first the shamatha, from shamatha meditation. And then Vibhachana,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:34.600
 next following that. So that is Vibhachana. That means, for example, Madhivaka meditation,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:42.360
 Mahamudra meditation and Zoki meditation also encompassed within these two,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:51.080
 Samad meditation and Vibhachana meditations. All that encompasses. But first we did talk

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:58.280
 and the teaching and the meditation is shamatha. Why? Because immediately we cannot go to the

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:06.760
 Vibhachanas, because of our strength of concentrations. Our mind is kind of so busy,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:16.600
 so kind of spoiled with the always running all the time. It has no regulations, no systems of the,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:23.560
 when it comes to the mind, everything of our mind systems, the movement has no systems, no

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.120
 schedules,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:36.200
 no kind of any boundaries. It's all running. This is up talking about our mind. I'm talking about

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.920
 your mind. I'm talking about my mind. That's how the mind is. But you look that, from day

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:54.130
 we wake up in the morning, at night we go to bed or sleeping. Always is running. No regular

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.000
 schedules,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:06.190
 no directions, just turbulence. In the night again we dream. We're running with dream unless we

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.760
 went

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:17.960
 deep sleeping. Sleeping otherwise is so active. So therefore, the shamatha is so important.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.480
 Shamatha, so our mind, what is in the teaching, is like drunk elephant. Or sometimes in the city

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:36.680
 use the example as wild horse or drunk monkey. Our person's mind is no regulations. Generally,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:45.720
 mind, or sorry, monkeys are busy. But when it's a drunk monkey, you can imagine what monkey's

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:53.000
 active weapon. Horse is considered before, before the technologies. It's going to pass me running.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:02.520
 But when it's a drunk horse, a wild, drunk horse. Again, you wonder how are they able to. This is

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:09.880
 same as our mind. So therefore, shamatha is so, so, so important. It's crucial.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:18.440
 Shamatha is a Sanskrit word and, of course, we all know. Shamatha means calmly abiding.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:28.120
 Calmly abiding. Shamatha. Shamatha is a Shanti. Ota, sutta is abiding.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:37.560
 Scientists. That means now mind to begin to rest. Begin to rest. And so that is what really

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.200
 them are, how the shamatha started. Now, for example, when you have good, when you are in

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.400
 good postures, what we discussed, according to your cup of blood, the principal point of the

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:57.400
 posture is comfortable, spacious, relaxed. That is important. With that, now you begin to do,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:04.440
 you're going to meditate. Whenever you like to follow the formal instructions, formal instructions,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:12.920
 once you did those breathing, I said, after that, then in the teaching said, do some prayers,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:19.960
 devotional prayers, and feel the preciousness, feel the heart and joy. Really those like some

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.600
 simple

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:28.920
 prayers, kind of deep call of your devotion, deep call of your heart, deep call of the willing,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.880
 of the progress, of the relaxation, of the calmness, and to the Buddha's bodhisattva,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:44.040
 and to those calling the lama pha, or short one, if you do, seven-line prayers,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:52.680
 seven-line prayer, and all those simple ones, really from the deep heart with the devotions.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:01.080
 This time is seven-line prayers. What do you call? It's seven-line prayers, call of your devotion,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:13.000
 call of your joy. You call of our trust, call of our openness, willingness. Join them.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.360
 And if you remember, some of us, when you do read that seven-line prayer, I said, yes,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:26.760
 it's the embodiment of all, but as every enlightenment, so many blessed lives to you

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.680
 and to everyone, blessed to you completely. Finally, I'm going to be somewhat dissolved

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:42.840
 into light and merge with your own nature of the mind or heart center. Now you begin to do the

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:53.160
 meditation. Nowadays, when we do the Shama meditation, there are many, many instructions.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:03.400
 But I'm going to do something simple and just three of those. Three of those. All is basically

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:11.880
 the goal is the same to bring calm of the mind to mind. That means to make stable of our mind,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.520
 stable, stable of our minds. So now postman, for example, now you're sitting on the posture,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:25.800
 you did all those beautiful prayers. And leading your master, all that hurt your own

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:33.080
 nature of the mind. And now you're going to relax. When you relax in the teaching, there's

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.800
 instructions,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:43.560
 there is true. Now focus. We have to focus. Shama means you have to focus. Focus, there is

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:53.400
 focus to the outer limb, focusing inward, the first two. Out of the outer limb is

00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:03.640
 from you, from out of me or from out of you. And this is out of you, focus

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:13.160
 out. And out of that has also true. Focusing the regular objects or focusing to the holy objects.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:21.640
 So true objects. Focusing outward as true. That's what I mean. There's numerous techniques,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:28.200
 there's documents, but I'm using those two. Focusing outward, that means outward or body in a way.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:41.160
 And the regular one is, write a distance of maybe one yoke distance, such as Y-O-L-K-R-E, yoke.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:51.880
 Yoke distance, you put some stones or small piece of marble, small piece of some kind of small,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:21:00.440
 but shiny, catchy, catchy, you put that right in front there. And now you're going to concentrate

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:11.080
 to that. So that object, what you're putting is focal point. It's a focal point that you're going

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:20.290
 to really hold. You're concentrating. Concentrate. So that means your mind is to the eye, and the

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:20.840
 eyes

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:31.720
 are to that object. Or you sometimes instead, our mind is with two eyes, and the two eyes are as a

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:42.040
 triangle point, point into that object. Now you're holding, you're focusing. I've been holding me,

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:50.120
 I've seen now, you're focusing it. Focusing. When you focus that, what is the teaching said?

00:21:52.280 --> 00:22:04.040
 Instead, try to not blink in your eye, and not move in your eye or our eye. Focus. Because what is

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:17.480
 the teaching said? The essential of the mind is really wind. Wind. So that means the mind is very

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.920
 much connected to the wind. Wind is very much connected to the channels on the nervous system.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:33.720
 Nervous systems are very much connected to the eye. So when the eye is more stable, that means

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:41.640
 it was stabilizing the channels. That channel means stabilizing, it was stabilizing the wind.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:49.000
 When wind is stabilizing, it will happen to stabilizing the mind. Therefore, in the teaching

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.760
 said, try to not move the eye or blink in. Just concentrate. Very softly, gently, then you don't

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:10.520
 have to stir it up there, but very gently, peacefully looking to that eye. And now this eye,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:19.640
 when you do, what that focus is? In the teaching said, again, the focus of the object focus is like

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:28.280
 pillar. It's like pillar. When you concentrate like that, concentrate continually without

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:40.120
 distracting. That is mindfulness. So that mindfulness is rob, rob, I believe, r-o-b-e,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:50.360
 rob or string, string maybe. String of the, string, string of the mindfulness is tied up with the

00:23:50.360 --> 00:24:05.080
 pillar. Pillar. And what is holding? Wild horse. Wild horse is, has like string that hooked,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:16.120
 tied up with pillar. Who's checking that? Training that? Consciousness. Consciousness is trainer

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:28.520
 checking how wild horse is behaving. So that means all that three are targeted very gently,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:40.600
 very peacefully. But focus, because we don't want to be distracted. So pillar of the focus,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:49.240
 to the pillar of the focus, the wild horse of mind is tied up the rob of the mindfulness.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:25:01.560
 And consciousness is checking up, occasionally, how it is, how it is. What is checking up? Checking

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:10.600
 out of what I said the other day, all the day, among the five obstacles, sinking mind, wide mind,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:23.320
 checking up. It is like sinking mind to meet spooky and dull, sleepy spirits. Wake up. That is not

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:32.520
 distractions. Every wild is running the full direction in the world of the five sensibility

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:41.480
 obstacles. That is not concentration. It is a distraction. So to bring back, whichever is

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:50.440
 bring back, continually again, do the same way. We don't complain to ourselves. We don't feel

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:58.840
 bad about anything. We don't ask questions about this why, this and that. Simply being aware that

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:10.360
 by consciousness, put back to the same way, that is known as the meditation or the concentrations.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:19.400
 Concentration or the damn meditation, generally dividing into three, right? We went early quite

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:27.880
 enough to put quite a while ago, every paramata, we divided three, three, three. I mean, it is not

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.040
 just we divided, that is the teaching. Teaching said each of those divided into three. And

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:41.650
 concentration or the damn paramata is divided also as the three. And three stages of the med

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:42.280
itations.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:51.960
 Pause stages, second stages, third stages of the concentration or the damn, samtije parottosambam.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:27:01.400
 Three stages. Pause one is, I translated the other time, the beginner general meditations.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.360
 That's what I translated, really. Every you remember that, oh, I mean, you know that what I'm

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:16.200
 talking about, we already know. But it is also known as intubate, how that said, chepa, nirkyuk,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:25.720
 samtije, means generally beginning of a big, big first stage of the beginning of the, the, the

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:33.880
 interest meditations or the meditation that enters all the meditators, meditators. That is

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:44.040
 beginning. Meditation, one which makes it more interesting or more willing to meditate for the

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:54.920
 meditators or practitioners. That is the beginning. Why? That is first. Second is, second stage is,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:04.920
 meditation or second stage is understanding the meaning of the, meaning of the, of the phenomenon

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.760
 or meaning, understand the meaning, clearly understand the meanings. That is the second

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.760
 stage of the meditation. Third stage of the meditation is, third stage of the

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:24.520
 meditation that even police, the tatha gatas or the buddhas are policed. Police, that is third

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:24.840
 stage

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:32.680
 meditations. So those are three stages. But now what we're talking is the beginning stages.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:42.040
 The meditators, first stage that interested the old meditator to meditate.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:52.680
 That I'm translating, cheaper, near you, yes, something. Why? People are interested. Because

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.640
 those who are interested on the meditation or know that somewhere, look, they see the benefit of

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:57.720
 the

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:05.080
 meditation. They see. That's what everyone is talking now. I can't say everyone. So many people

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:12.040
 are talking about the meditation. Even they don't have any kind of beliefs or anything. They're all

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:20.680
 talking of the meditation because it has power. It has benefit. You feel immediately.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:32.680
 It brings calm, peaceful, kind of comfort. It brings comfort. The world of stress force,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:40.960
 world with the anxieties, really, it brings. Therefore, so many of those peoples are kind of

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.240
 excited,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:49.400
 interested, talking about meditation. That's what it's called. Because why? They're attracted,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:54.200
 they're kind of, attracted or ever used, they're attracted, they're not, they're kind of

00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:01.960
 interested of the explore of the feeling of the calm and peaceful. So they are clinging in a way,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:09.800
 attracted to the, the feeling of comfort. Of course, that we all know is nothing wrong.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:17.160
 They see well and important. That is, is beginning serious.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:25.400
 If we continue meditation this way, constantly there, our mind will become more calm, more

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:33.320
 peaceful, more stable, not running all the time, all the time. At the beginning of time when we

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:40.120
 meditate, what is the teaching said? The fourth experience is that you can see the turbulence of

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:49.160
 the mind, restless state of the mind, running everywhere, every direction. Even you can,

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:57.480
 or we cannot hold one second, almost really, cannot. That's how our mind is doing all the time.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:06.840
 Why we notice it then now? Because we meditate. When we're not meditating, even then we will not

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:14.600
 rely on that how our mind is acting. Because we carry it out all the time, external work,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:24.520
 out all the time. So therefore, now, that's what in the teaching said, or those great masters said,

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:30.280
 don't worry that if the mind you see the book running like that, that means you are meditating.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:38.440
 That means you are really seeing things. Begin to see things how our inner world of the mind is

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:46.840
 acting, the emptiness in mind is acting. You see, therefore feel happy, be strong in courage,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:55.560
 continually meditate. Meditate. At this time, then when you become all the most stable,

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:03.960
 or they become, then three experiences will come. One after another, or maybe randomly, those are

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:14.440
 known as the mindfulness experience, clarity experience, and no thought experience. Those

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:22.120
 experiences will come gradually, or they may be regularly, randomly will come. But those are known

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:32.680
 as the playable result of the meditation or the concentrators. This state is also still known as

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:38.200
 this positive meditation. Even we have a lot of kind of comfortable blissfulness,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:48.120
 and kind of clarity, no thought, very comfortable thought. That is also still positive meditation,

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:56.280
 because we are, our peoples are doing meditation more kind of with longing for the feeling,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.920
 longing for that comfort, longing for that quietness. They meditate. Meditated, that's

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.120
 what is called positive. Which is good, that means progress. To develop your mind,

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:20.600
 you become a little more calm and more peaceful. More peaceful. Then when we continually meditate,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:27.640
 again. Again is the same, so that means what? For example, when you have the time, meditate,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.680
 do all your childing practice with the concentration, with meditation, and then do the

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:39.800
 silence meditation. We're trying to really change our mind for at least 10 minutes,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:47.640
 every session. Every session. So then that is really the practice, every session. So that means

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:55.560
 every session you do, like every day, at least every day, once in one hour, two hours, whatever

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:02.440
 your time. That was called continually keeping. I said the other day, once in a while meditation

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.880
 practicing is not going to be a big happiness. And we will actually do the difference, we have to

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.040
 be

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:17.000
 keep continuous. Keep the rhythm. Keep the rhythm. Keep continuous. Read about what I discussed

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.440
 the other day, five supporters. Bring more joy, more appreciation, more thankful yourself that

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:30.040
 you're making some times. They've driven out into our mind, they bought our mind. They were never

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:37.640
 taught before I heard the teaching of the greatest teacher of Bodhacharya Manoj. Really? Or maybe

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:37.880
 some

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:46.840
 other spiritual traditions. Otherwise, we never think about the mind, our self. And this time,

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:55.480
 we're looking the very root of everything. We're discovering it is natural, it is beauty, it is

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:02.920
 capabilities. Wonderful, really wonderful, beautiful. That is called beginning of the

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:12.440
 taking advantage of the meaning of the British lives. That is what it is. And so, if you have time,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:19.960
 do maybe three times in a day, even your third time. If you have one hour to spend a time for the

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:26.680
 silence, meditation, like concentration, do that again. But if the teaching is said, very many

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:33.960
 times, master will say it. If you have one hour at a beginning time, if you have yourself alone,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:41.800
 maybe do maybe five, ten minutes, and then short breaks, do again. So, always keep the clarity of

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:51.400
 the mind. We don't want to be dull, meditating, nor scared in mind. What is it called? It is more

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:58.760
 important in the durations at the beginning time. Call it is more important. So, that's what we're

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:10.760
 going to call it. Very call it. Call it good meditation. Work, short time, but many times.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:22.760
 Each time activating the joy and appreciations, bodhijattas, parinosa, and the ocean breeze. Just

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:29.320
 even one of those short time, but that means even one minute. Reflect the mind, and again go back

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.480
 to

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:37.640
 that. And the teaching says, whatever you do, it will clarify the meditation. It will really make

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:46.600
 our meditation more pristine, more criss-crossed. Criss-wise, it is praised. Move it, move it to

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:46.840
 call

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.760
 it the meditation. It's worth praying. Pray. So, do that. This, this. So, they have, this,

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:02.680
 the first time meditation is there, as we say. You see, first it is you have comfort, calmness,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:10.120
 peaceful, then gradually they are developed. Drop the blissfulness, happiness, comfort, that

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.440
 becomes

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:17.320
 more kind of stronger. Then in the teaching, it says, clarity. Clarity, what that means? In the

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:23.880
 teaching, it says, when clarity comes, even you can see kind of your wisdom is more kind of growing

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:23.880
,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.600
 looks more open, more growing. Even you see that you begin to know more than what you used to know.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.920
 And as well as also, even in the teaching, it says, you can see behind the walls, or kind of some

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:44.280
 tree, your kind of different kind of vegans, and the kind of status that come in. But again, it is

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.960
 display of the mind, where this is not our final goal or the big achievement. It's just,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.360
 if we start clinging and grasping to that, it is disastrous. It is obstacles,

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:09.400
 handedness. Therefore, what in the teaching said, don't attach to the flavor of those experiences,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:16.280
 where there is a blissfulness, where there is a clarity, where there is no dual copes, no copes.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:24.600
 Keep continually applying the teaching that you received, or what you learned, or what we learned.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:33.000
 Keep continuing. Say God, "Mere Mornamos, you in appreciation, bodhicata, feeling the closeness,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.440
 connection to all the lineage masters, being grateful, grateful, really that humble and simple,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.440
 droned with art, yet courage and commitment and confidence and determinations are ready,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:54.040
 become stronger and stronger, deeper and deeper. And that's what we're going to discover our inner

00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:00.900
 goal, inner wall of the beauties. That's how we're really going to discover. That is the post-st

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.080
itch

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:09.080
 of the meditations. In a debate, I mean, in the teaching, say, "Chipa, nirgurya," something.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:15.240
 So that is my talk for today, and I'm going to stop here. Thank you very much again for your

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.680
 participation and coming, and really thank you so much everyone. And then I have some short

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:28.040
 announcement this time, and which is that we told we're going to do teaching, teaching in the

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:35.320
 practice, at this Zoom practice, the teaching, continually Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and we're

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:42.520
 going to change slightly there, because all this change of what in the country is, and the world

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.920
 happening now, is a little bit like, which is wonderful news, is like lifting up these lockdowns

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.000
 everywhere, and if a world had more country, and they'd like to have more outdoor activities,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.760
 and all that reasons. And then plus, in this June, we have quite two celebrations, one after

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.400
 another,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:07.480
 and now we soon, we will have also celebration of the "Kentipadishiram," which Mahaparinarvana,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:15.240
 and in Dakini ceremony, and as well as also solar eclipse. All those are really coming this time.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:23.400
 So we told we will not have all the Friday and Saturday and Sunday activities except for two,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:30.120
 among that three days, we will have two days. Friday and Saturday, we will continually keep the

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:36.440
 teaching and the practice as we are doing, and then Sunday, we're off. Everyone is off.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:45.080
 And you know, you know, everyone is off, from the big one to the small ones. So we said off,

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:51.640
 and we can eat yours. So that's what really I thought. I'm really told to announce that we'll

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:57.880
 be more comfortable to everyone, so it's more scheduled and that. But police, of course,

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.400
 we're all doing, and also I'd just like to remind you, we are all still, even though lifting up the

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.480
 lockdown, all that, we have to keep it very thoughtful and careful. I think it's more practical.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:16.520
 If we do that, it's nothing really going to kind of damage our reputations, not our identities.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:23.160
 And so I think it's good. It's good for safety, everyone. It's good, and it's good for us,

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.600
 good for others, and that is our goal. The graduate teacher, Brother Chagamuni said,

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:35.320
 "For further true purposes, benefited others, benefited ones themselves." So in some daily,

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:42.180
 we also really lined up what our graduate teachers taught, and so I just thought to tell that, okay

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:42.280
.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:48.190
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating. Again, thank you. And now we begin to think, okay

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.280
,

00:41:48.280 --> 00:42:07.000
 now we do the practice of the healing practice, okay. Then we get here.
