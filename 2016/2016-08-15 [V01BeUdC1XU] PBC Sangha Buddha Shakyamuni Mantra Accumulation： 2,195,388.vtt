00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 "Two million ninety-one thousand to four hundred and forty-two people. We accumulated the mantra of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.000
 the Buddha Shakyamuni, the great completion one.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.740
 Buddha's mantra, so we dedicate, is made as which I need his prayer, for all peace, among them, the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.000
 joy, and then also good health, prospering every living things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 And also there's no more wars, fighting, arguing, curling, disturbance to each other. And also, I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 wish and pray we dedicate, it is made.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.050
 Partly the balance of all the elements, there's no more natural disasters, sicknesses, and wars. I

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.000
 mean, all those really rich and purple.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 Everyone has good health, joy, peace, a long life, prosperity. And it's complete, their heart

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 filled with joy and peace,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 and happiness, and a very pernicious and respectful appreciation.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.430
 As the Buddha, the Buddha is the embodiment of peace, and harmony, and joy, and respect, and also

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 passion, and tolerance.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.470
 That's what the Buddha Shakyamuni is. And it's just beautiful activity, and being as simple as

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000
 normal, as a regular person, that's what Buddha is.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 So really wish every living being should talk to the Earth, and have kind of good, decent dignity

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 of the human values, and values of all living beings.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Kind of wish that, so we accumulate this money. So really wish that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.080
 So as we pray, as we dedicate, this merit, and so by the blessings of the Buddha, all the wishes

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.000
 that we chime in happen, sincerely, in the presence of all, the Buddha's body suffers.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And so, that's it, the announcement, and it's a very good fulfillment of the mantra.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Accumulating, and this is the very, year is a very special day for those who follow in the teaching

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 of the Buddha,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.740
 have the money part, because of the Gurga Maasambhava, and this year is the very special year of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.000
 the Gurga Maasambhava.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So, we dedicate, and listen to it.
