00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.710
 "Buddha Five Stupas. This Stupa is called Kiyo Bolodos, but is the representative of the Buddha's

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.600
 birthday, birth Stupa.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.530
 Stupa is on that way. Also, this is the Lumina, Lumina where Buddha was born. This is the Lumina

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.000
 Garden."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.300
 "And then Buddha, when he is very similar to the Buddha, and then second, the first activity is the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 Buddha of the Enlightenment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.220
 This is the Enlightenment and the Buddha Gaya, as we all know. So the Enlightenment Stupa, this is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 the Enlightenment Stupa.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 Also, this Stupa is called the Stupa of Subhuman All the Maras, all the negative forces. Buddha

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 defeated all that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 So this is the Buddha Gaya or the Enlightenment.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 And the upper hand is the Enlightenment and then Buddha gave the teachings.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.490
 And this Stupa, that this Stupa, like this Stupa is called the "Drol of the Many Aspichos" or "Drol

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.000
 of the Many Aspichos".

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 "Aspichos" is the prosperity or the liberation, and that this is the symbolized teaching of the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.000
 Buddha.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And that is also in the one that way, in the "Vahlanas" where Buddha gave the first teaching.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 And then, the one principle, then another one, so the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, teaching, and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 Mahaparin Rana.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 This represents the Mahaparin Rana, where Buddha, where the entire Mahaparin Rana is eating.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And that is the "Kukinara" where Buddha, so this is the represent of the "Kukinara".

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Then now there is one extra, that is the Stupa, this is Stupa, this is extra.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 This is called the extended life of the Buddha.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 When Buddha announced that he was inside the Mahaparin Rana and there is a black iron smith,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 it is known as the Garvapur, or the son of the black iron smith.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 The Buddha accepted this and extended his lives.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 This is called the long life Stupa, also this is known as the "Unihya Vijaya Stupa".

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 But this morning, the empowerment, that is really, so this "Unihya Vijaya" is the Stupa,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 or the "Unihya Vijaya" is the Buddha that extended Buddha's life.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So this is very famous, again, among the earth Stupa, or this core Stupa we have here,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and one extra, which is at the "Unihya Vijaya Stupa" extending lives.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.190
 And then earth Stupa up there, and together all that of Stupa, this fiber, all there, near the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.000
 temple.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So what is after this?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 There is a Stupa of the Buddha descended from the heaven,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 and there is also a Stupa called the miracle of Stupa.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Buddha performed the miracle activity in Isharastha.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 So that is so what, then how many Stupa?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 57, and then what?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And then also there is a Stupa called the harmonized Stupa.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And then there is some hunger, this harmony is happening,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 and then because of the recursivity of the Kali Puttara and Mangala Puttara,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.060
 then Buddha harmonized all those, and they called the harmonized Stupa, or the, yeah, harmonizing

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.000
 Stupa.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 So we have three extra up there, but this is the five principles Stupa.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And so that's it, I just thought to tell you all,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
