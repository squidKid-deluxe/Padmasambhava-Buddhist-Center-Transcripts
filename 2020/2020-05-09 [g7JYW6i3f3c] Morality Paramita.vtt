00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Thank you, everyone. Welcome. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for coming and the participants, again,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.320
 making time for this.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.040
 And now, again, we're going to go to the teachings of the greatest teachers, kindness teachers,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:32.660
 compassionate teachers, the Buddha Shatya Muni, and that particularly, highlighted by Kebye, the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 New Room Leader,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 the reading of the famous symbol in the 20th century. So we're following His instructions,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.920
 following that.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.640
 Again, we have these opportunities, even though our circumstances are really kind of strange and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.880
 not exactly what we wanted,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:59.640
 we hear that, but it happens. And in that situation, we're using this something, good, beautiful

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.040
 purposes, good purposes,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 to activate, to strengthen, deepening our dharma understanding. And dharma is so important because

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.680
 it touches our heart.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 It's our nature, nature of everyone. It is kindness, it's compassion. It's loving, love to all the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 beings.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.560
 It is respect, appreciation. It's non-wholeness. Everything what in the world, whether you have

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.400
 believed or not believed,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.620
 always admires, talks, that is really dharma. That is the teaching of the greatest teacher of the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.560
 Buddha Shatya Muni.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:55.360
 He came, Buddha taught, exactly where things are, truth as it is, simple as it is, natural as it is

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.040
, where things are as it is.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.530
 That's what the greatest teacher, the smart teacher, very simple and a powerful teacher, taught

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.160
 these 200, 600, maybe wordless echos.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.560
 Ever since, so many great beings, also many beings are inspired, attracted by this teaching,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.160
 because this teaching is not just a kind of isolated and selective group teaching. It's talking to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.520
 everyone, everyone.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.640
 It doesn't matter whether you are human or not human. It's teaching, this is teaching to every

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 admired.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.800
 All the sentient beings of six realms, admires, appreciate this teaching because it is love.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 It's compassion, it's kindness, it's respect and appreciation.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.660
 I'm not just talking this because I believe in the Buddhism, but you look, you read it, you follow

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.200
 the teaching and instructions.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.530
 This is really true, that is what it is. So therefore, whether we have the name of the Buddhism or

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.320
 not named, those are our principles.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.760
 These are our nature. That is what we are really grouping, retouching, reorganizing.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.640
 So this is very, in a way, even though the situation is strange and not good, good that happened.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.520
 Didn't really wish by anyone's, but that happened.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.880
 And we are using this situation, something beautiful, reason and purpose, not just only for us.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.920
 We are talking about the body, the thinking of all living beings. We are really talking about that.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.880
 It's sincerely we are talking, not just also kind of, but certainly as lip service as well.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.960
 Really truly means all that. So therefore, it is something that we really can be generated, enjoy

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.480
 it,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.040
 can be enjoyed in all our reminder of life, these lives.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.600
 And according to the Buddha's teaching and the teaching of Guru Vayma Sambha, it will definitely

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.480
 continue throughout all the way to enlightenment.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.560
 So therefore, again, we are going to withstand joy and appreciations and vastness,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.160
 motivation of the body together and purely the realization of the Vedayana teachings or practice of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.520
 what we have taught.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.360
 With that, again, we are following our old breakfast as the great masters of practicing lineage put

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 into three frames.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.240
 The beginning good or noble, middle noble, hard noble.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 So we are following that frame and now we are in middle noble.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.480
 Middle noble is a noble of that pre-front grasping and cleanliness.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.800
 And that means what the brain tries to understand where things are.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.370
 Where things are, what that also means, according to the teaching, according to those realization-

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.520
related beings,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.400
 all things are at a relative level in the Mahayana teaching or in general Buddhism.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.560
 It's like mirage, it's like bubbles, it's like reflection moon in the water.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.640
 This all like dreams, this all, this is not just object as a dream, but reflection moon in the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.680
 water and variety.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:47.000
 Our self is like that, subject and object, all that status.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.240
 That is really true. So at least break those understanding is really good, is kind of close to the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.200
 nature.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.000
 But at the end of time what we have? We always have a solitude thing.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.560
 Solitude, solid is solid, conquered, unbreakable in the way, thinking even though it's breakable,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.720
 that attitude, that clinging we have, everything is kind of like solid is all right.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.000
 That is not true according to the teaching when you have the realizations.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.080
 And that really exploring by this, the present, common present, those great philosophers or those

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.040
 great thinkers or great adventures are exploring.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.790
 That's the one really great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said, two thousand six hundred, he said, it

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.200
's true.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.320
 And then according to the Mahayana teaching, that lucid nature is not just lucid,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.320
 it's a kind of dream like and variety like that. That is the display of the enlightenment.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:09.530
 Enlightenment, our all-wisdom display, wisdom display, so it's wisdom poems, wisdom songs, wisdom

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.840
 minds.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.160
 All is in wisdom status or enlightenment status.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:24.620
 For those reasons what in the Mahayana teaching often say, three major status, major poem, major

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.000
 song, major mind and spaces.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.480
 Why? What is the major? Major is Sanskrit word, means indestructible.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.280
 That means it's not something solid or indestructible, but nature cannot be changed.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.600
 Nature cannot be changed by the duality, conceptions.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.080
 The deluded mind cannot change, no matter how much we are deluded, how much we go through in

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.040
 delusions.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:04.440
 Nature is never going to change. Therefore, it is indestructible, infractible.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:13.320
 The nature cannot change. It remains the same as it is. It's what it is, it will be.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:19.640
 It's all in enlightenment status. All in the Mahayana state is very inner teaching state.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.880
 And for those reasons what in the teaching state, all every poems are enlightened.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:36.440
 As five male Buddha's, every element is our five female Buddha's. All enlightened.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:44.200
 And that is not solid. The conquering is the display. It is magical show.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:53.800
 And it's like emanations. It's like emanations. It starts forming, changing, reflecting,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:02.280
 back and forth, rejecting. It's all played on the edges. That is true.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:09.960
 This is not just only happening in the outer goal. It's our mind. Our whole systems are happening.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:19.320
 Same way. So have those realization is known as no grasping, no clinging, mundane conceptions.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.760
 Conceptions. Bring those realization as you follow the teachings.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:31.800
 Whatever the teaching you are, practice who you are. Kind of trying to bring that.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.080
 But also in the teaching in the New Maha schools of Buddhism. Go ahead and guard that.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:45.080
 In relative truth everything is purity states. And absolute truth is all equanimity states.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.640
 Equanimity states is all in great emptiness states.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:56.840
 That means the whether form is a great emptiness. Whether soul is a great emptiness.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:03.800
 Whether mind and space is a great emptiness. All in a union. All are in spirit.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.720
 Indivisible or inseparable. That nature is that. So bring those realization.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.440
 Have that according to sadhana, according to practice with that poet.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.360
 In our poems, we are talking about the bodhicchata.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:31.000
 It's also a magic. Where is it coming from? The bodhicchata. Where is that powerful bodhicchata?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.800
 Where is das and didn't think that powerful bodhicchata?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:44.360
 Have you started thinking that all is magic? That is emanation. It's miracles.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:51.560
 Miracles of the power of the mind. There is no endings.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:59.320
 This emanation goes on and on. It's unfolding, displayed, multitude of status.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.960
 Complexity in a way. So many varieties.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.760
 But each all are sparkling. It's all shimmerless. All distracted.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.160
 Even though the techie is all different forms. In the Buddha teaching, what is it?

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.640
 All is within the state of love and kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.480
 In the emptiness state, inseparable. All is within that status.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.200
 That is what the relief means. The principle, novel without grasping.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.400
 Without clingings. Not mundane cling, ordering with emotion,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.920
 solids, that kind of tangible thing.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.440
 Have you started doing that? In the teaching, the author said,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:51.800
 we are not correctly, verbally doing the practices.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.280
 So therefore, with those understanding, now we follow, again,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.040
 with our principle novel or the middle novel.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.920
 Middle novel is as what we are learning in bodhicana.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.360
 It's the act of life in bodhicana. Act of life in bodhicana is summarized

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.120
 into six paramatas. All six transcendental practices.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.280
 And those are, as you all know, and the genderities and the moralities.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.280
 And so on, one after another, all that. Six of those.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:33.800
 Each of those, all of these entire six paramata practices,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.280
 if you condense that, I said the other day, and you all know, of course.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.720
 Knowing is in three extra old age trainings.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.080
 And those are the morality training, concentrations, and wisdom.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.960
 I said that. That encompasses the entire bodhatiki, the essence,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.880
 the essence, the meanings. And this morality, for example, morality practices

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.600
 of the three extra old age teaching, is mainly dealing with the physical,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.160
 physical activities. That is morality activities.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.200
 To display, be gentle, more peaceful, more good manner,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.880
 more good ethics, more good conduct. Their conduct, their ethics or activity,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.120
 they're not going to disturb the others, not disturbing our practice of meditation.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:33.560
 So that is morality. Mainly is connected with the physical activities.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:42.120
 Then concentration is mainly connected with mind. Mind is deeper.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.200
 So as I said, physical, not just physical. So if you say also

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:53.160
 verbal, this morality is verbally, is connected more principal teaching

00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:00.120
 on how to behave of our body activity, our verbal or speech activities.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.120
 Bring more gentle, more peaceful, more soothing,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.720
 more calming to one's own self, as well as other beings, other beings.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.560
 That is morality teaching. The next one is,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.560
 is concentration. Concentration is teaching on the primary, on the mind.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:28.840
 Mind is more sophisticated, deeper, and the mind is principled. Therefore,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.240
 this concentration is teaching every brain, mind,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.760
 display, gentle and expertly beauty of the mind.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.880
 And then wisdom is to all of us. We need wisdom for the morality.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.760
 We need wisdom. We need wisdom for the concentration.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.560
 And wisdom is a finite, ultimate goal. Even concentration

00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:00.840
 well helps to bring the perfect wisdom, knowledge, or the understanding.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.760
 That, if we expanded that 33 extraordinary training, training practices,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.720
 then it's a six-part-a-mata, as I said. And I'm not a six-part-a-mata.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.960
 I mentioned yesterday about generous practices.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:22.760
 And each of those parameters, according, it has four different powers,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.640
 four different powers, each of those. As I said yesterday,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.960
 I'm sure you heard and you know that. I mean, I'm sure many of you already know

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.240
 those things. But again, I'm talking the four different powers.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:44.440
 It will purify the opposite or the opposite of those six-part-a-mats.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.800
 For example, opposite of generosity is miser,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:57.320
 strange, strange, miser. So when you do generosity, it will purify,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:05.240
 or it will play with strangeness, according. So it's purified.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:13.080
 And when we do this, it purifies the strangeness and misering.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.760
 Misering, what is brain's result, temporary result, according to the teaching,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.520
 generous brain, it will bring more us, which is very rich.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.200
 It will bring abundance. Even when we're doing generosity, looks like we're giving way,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.600
 but reality really brings back, returns back. For example, in the

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:45.560
 springtime, palm's foot, seed, throwing the grain on the grass,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:52.760
 or on the, sorry, on the field, they're throwing the grains

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:59.880
 in the, in the field, field. At that time, looks like that,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.320
 that palm was throwing the grains in the soil.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:13.960
 But in the autumn, it will bring more than what you had in the springtime.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.440
 That is a logic. And generosity will bring more bundles.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.680
 So it will purify the strange, strange, and then strange,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.080
 but if we do misering, right, clinging or misering, strange,

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.920
 the result of the next life. In the teaching said,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.320
 it will, it will burn. Of course, with other emotional or

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.560
 negative karma, it will take us to the hungry god's hands.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.200
 It will make the world in the lower hands. So therefore,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.560
 each of those parameters will dispel the opposite of those.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.640
 Suppose it generously dispels the stingy or the miserous.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:08.040
 Morality, if we keep the morality, it will dispel the unethicals,

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:15.080
 immoral, immoral, actively it will dispel. And when we have the patient,

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.560
 it will dispel the angry, terminus, it will dispel. When we have

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.360
 due of effort, it will dispel immediately laziness,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.800
 sharpness, it will dispel. And when you have the concentration,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.440
 it will dispel the distracted, scared mind, distracted mind,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:45.160
 lost mind, it will escape, scared wisdom. And if we have the wisdom,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.360
 it will dispel darkness, the ignorance. So therefore,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.800
 each of those has power immediately to clear away

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.400
 the different obstacles, handlers to our practices for our

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.040
 both each other activities. At the same time, and as I said, the

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.800
 gendelus we need to do, it will bring the result of the

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.800
 boundaries. And morality in the teaching said, the

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.800
 result will be more happier, more peaceful. Morality will bring more

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.640
 peace and happiness. And the patient will bring more courage,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.640
 more confidence, and also will bring more beautiful

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.080
 compilations, compilations of beautiful looking images.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.320
 And joyful effort will bring more dignity,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:46.200
 more fulfillment, more fulfillment. And concentration will bring more calm

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.640
 in peaceful states. And then wisdom will bring more wisdom,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.320
 more knowledge, understanding. So each of those

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:02.360
 has all those different powers. Then, so I said, each of those

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.840
 has powers. I don't have, should say maybe at the

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.560
 beginning, maybe that is a little easier there. And I said yesterday that too, but

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.680
 it kind of went with together with many others.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.720
 If we're so stable, I'm trying to kind of highlight this.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.560
 The first one is, each of those, what the great master

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.760
 Magdira or Asanga said in the teaching, that

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.840
 it will defeat the opposite or the obstacles of each of those parameters.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.920
 First one is, the second, each of those parameters

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.760
 will bring the wisdom, realization of the wisdom. It will really bring the

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.440
 great systems. Each of those will bring wisdom.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.280
 So wisdom of the, of course, will gradually bring

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.240
 realization of the wisdom, the absolute truth,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:57.000
 exactly as it is, exactly it is, but according to the extent of that.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.440
 Finally, as I said yesterday, the wisdom that will bring

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:06.920
 the pre-print three spheres, subject, object, and activity,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:12.680
 that emptiness realization will bring each of those in the teaching center.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.840
 And then the fourth one, sorry, the fourth, not fourth one,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.400
 third one, of each of those, it will prefer the wishes of the

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.560
 individuals, and yours, it will prefer your own,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:32.040
 one's own, it will prefer the wishes and wishes for others, it will prefer.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.240
 Such as generously, when you give generously, it will prefer my happy others.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.520
 You feel more happy, too. When you give the morality,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.040
 it will make happy you, it will make happy others.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.560
 And passion, the joyful effort, everything, when you do,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.280
 it really proposes the wishes of the, wishes of the one's own self,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.920
 as well as others. Then more than that, it will finally, it will help to bring

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.680
 those connected ones, if they continually have you help,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.320
 it will bring to their connected, just the national of the teachings.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.960
 According Buddhism, it will bring to the, to the, to the

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.800
 share of the Jhana, Jhanas, but the Buddha Jhanas,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.400
 and the Bodhisattva Jhanas. So it will bring the maturity state of the Ahato,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.000
 but, but the Buddha who, any enlightened state,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.560
 Buddha who state, it really will lead. So therefore, each of those

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:37.640
 has those four different powers of qualities. That is what

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.880
 these paramatas are. Now, among that, among that, amongst the paramatas,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:50.360
 I said yesterday about the generosity. Today, I'm going to talk

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:57.080
 morality paramatas. And I'm going slowly by this time. The reason why,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:03.320
 because we are all in the home, I believe so. We're not going to take

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.160
 the plans. We're not kind of limited by the one,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 one week or three days. And otherwise, we're all busy in the modern

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.960
 time. Teacher is busy, and students are busy.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:23.240
 They don't have time. And the great Master Long Kimba said in his teaching,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.320
 "Don't, in the future, my followers don't do the horse-rest teachings,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.520
 horse-rest teachings." Or maybe now, this time,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:39.000
 sport-rest teachings. Teachers don't have time to teach, and make shorter, and

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.160
 students don't have time to listen, make shorter, everything.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.880
 Like that, horse-resting. And this time, since we don't have to do horse-rest

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.280
 teachings, therefore, I'm really doing slowly by slow.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.600
 And practicing, and practicing of the healing practices,

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.880
 and dedicating all our merit to really to the benefit for all living beings,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.960
 also cleverly, these situations, circumstances of purified

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.760
 sickness and disease. According to the great teacher,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.560
 Bodhishaktamuni, he said, "If you have the good thought of

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.600
 with bodhicata, then all the practice, whether you're

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.320
 studying, listening, meditating practice, it will all go to the benefit for the

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.000
 same things. So, we are all knowing that. That way,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.920
 I'm going slowly by slowly. That way, I'm going to talk now

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:33.800
 with you again, slowly, by slowly, on the moralities.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.720
 In morality, I said already yesterday, and you all know that,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.600
 Sanskrit is shila, and shila, isolated in the debate,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.080
 so to term, so to term, in the debate. And that means,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.880
 what each of those great oscillators emanated,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.640
 oscillators oscillated, this shila in the soot term,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:25:01.560
 sorrow means the exiling systems, tame means, as a rule, rule of the system,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.480
 exiling systems, or exiling perfect manner,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:11.800
 system of the rule of perfect manner. That is maybe roughly the oscillation of

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.720
 the shila. Then, in the English, it's isolated as

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.120
 morality, I believe. Everyone is isolated, but it is

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.400
 teaching on the conduct, and teaching on the behaviors, and

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.000
 teaching of this bodhisattva, this time, bodhisattva,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.760
 morality is not just only the conduct of the bodhi in the speeches,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.920
 but it's the conduct of also mind. So, it is the conduct of the

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.000
 bodhi, speech, and mind. So therefore, it is more stronger than the

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.240
 general bodhisattva, teaching in a variety. When I teach,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.160
 offering conduct, morality is more indicated

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.960
 toward the activity of the bodhi and verbal speeches,

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:03.080
 but bodhisattva, or māhayana, now is, because bodhi together is a mind.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:10.200
 Mind, and therefore, this morality is supported to good, to progress,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:16.920
 to increase bodhisattva. For that reason, it is also mind. Mind, so therefore,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.160
 this omniscient morality there. Now, morality,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.280
 those meanings, small meanings, also I said,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.960
 and now, I'm going to, this is called in the teaching,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.840
 morality is divided into three moralities.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.200
 And many of you already know that, and that is,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:44.440
 I would say that post morality, that is, post morality is, that will

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:52.920
 avoid all the negative activities, negative activities. So that is post

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:58.200
 morality. Second morality, I mean, it is one morality, but it is

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.320
 three. The first is morality, that will avoid

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:09.720
 all the negative activities. And the second morality is

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:16.680
 gathering all the virtues, virtues, morality,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:24.520
 morality, that gathering all the virtues. And third is morality, that will

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.720
 benefit or support for all the living beings.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:38.600
 So those are the three moralities. And this first is, again, this morality,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:45.080
 that will avoid all the negative activities.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.520
 And that in the teaching set, in the teaching,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:59.080
 what is it about? And if it's also added that English, I think I saw that

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:06.680
 this burning thought, this burning thought, you understand?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:17.880
 D-I-S-D-A-D-I-A-N-N-I-N-G, I believe. The standing.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.640
 Or another word, a simple one, abandoning thought.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:30.440
 Continue to have the abandoning thought. What are we going to abandon?

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:37.160
 We're going to abandon all the negative activities. Negativities.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.320
 Not just activities, negative activities. And then it is action.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.520
 That abandon, that have come, that attitude, thought,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:55.240
 strongly in the heart and mind. That is actually the morality of the

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:01.880
 event learning or avoiding all the negative activities.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.040
 That attitude, when you have the mind in the mind,

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:13.720
 strongly. That now, that negativity, event and all the

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.800
 negative activities, then there is negative activities in the

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:30.040
 common sense-level negativities. That is worldly customs

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:37.240
 in the world existing, such as 10 non-virtues.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:44.040
 10 non-virtues I listed last time, and you all know I'm not going to list all that.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:51.480
 Three by the mind. No, sorry, start with four. Three by the body,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.920
 four by the mind, three by the mind. All together,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:06.200
 10 non-virtues. Again, three by the body, and four by the

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:13.320
 verbal speech, three by the mind. And those are known

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:21.560
 10 virtues. These 10 non-virtues are according to Buddhism.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.640
 It's a common non-virtues. You don't have to be,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.640
 you have religions or non-religions. It is something

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:37.240
 negative, something not also. It's commonly accepted

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.760
 negativities. Any standards of the countries or the

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.640
 traditions, regardless of what you believe, according to

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.800
 the teachings. So that is the negativities. Then

00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:01.080
 above that, any Buddhism, then such as the negativities

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.680
 such as avoiding or breaking rules of the vows of the

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.680
 opasika vows. For example, if you hear the opasika, if you take the opasika vows and break

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.280
 the rules of the opasika or the lay practitioners.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:23.480
 And the rules of the the novice monks and nuns if you take the vows.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.760
 If you take the vows of the nuns and monks, the fully ordered monks and nuns,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.720
 if we break the rules. And then you break the rules such as

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.680
 Buddhism vows, if you take the vows. And the Vedayana vows,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:47.720
 those are known as samayas. Those all are samayas. And that also known as

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.920
 general samayas, particularly samayas, and as well as those

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:59.560
 eight principles. Principles or the 14 dongfos. As

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.920
 we went last time, little bit really, but we joined

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.400
 those prayers. Such as when we do the 10th dapuya.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.680
 In the 25th dapuya, we do the named as the ini, or

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.560
 stance king. But all is the purification practices.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:25.320
 It is. Generally, when we happen, for example, these negativities.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.640
 When that happens, it's always important. The purify,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:38.840
 it's good. Really purify is so important. Important. And we don't purify, it kind

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.800
 of piles up. It accumulates up. But if we purify,

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.200
 then we purify. I mean, it's conscious, you purify.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.680
 So therefore, purification, purify is so important.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.160
 And how you purify? Generally, in the sutta teaching,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.800
 say, the one in the buddha teaching. On vinaya teaching, there is known as

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.800
 sobjung. Restoring the words and the purification.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.400
 Every month, there is two times. In the full moon and the new moon,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:18.200
 they do two times. Gather all the monks in the practice, you know, gather the monks

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.720
 and doing those seremons. Known as sobjung practices.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.120
 And sobjung in the very word, meanwhile, restore

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:35.000
 in the purification. And so, that is the purification. And in the bodhisattva

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.160
 teaching, vinaya teaching, also when you do the purification,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.760
 such as do the 35 buddha purification practices.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.480
 And those are known also like sutta of three hips.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:56.760
 hip h e a p s hips. What does it mean? The hip of the

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:05.400
 all-station, hip of the purification, hip of the dedications.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:13.240
 Those three hip practices with best known 35 buddhas. Again, we have those prayers.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.960
 We do those prayers. So do those prayers. And then also in the

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.720
 teaching said, in the morning, in the evenings, in the

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.040
 midday, if you can do evening and night, night time,

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.640
 if you do those mistakes, you should do the purification.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.560
 Purification. Three times in the day, if you can.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.800
 Three times a day, three times in the night, purify.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.640
 Purify any of the mistakes that happened.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:48.440
 That mistakes, anything happened. Whether it's big and small,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.240
 purify. And also same time, purify, then suggest

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.960
 purification practice, such as circulating the monasteries

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.160
 and stupas. Doing the post sessions, making the offerings

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.840
 of such as the flowers and incense and the

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.560
 light of the offerings. And making the community services.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.800
 All the service to the temples. All the those all known as purification

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.200
 practices, also same time, accumulate the merits.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.040
 And in the Vedic energy teaching is more of our practices.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.360
 Those are known as the practice of the Vedic sago practices.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.920
 At purification practices. Those are known as in the Vedic energy teaching,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.840
 as many of you all received the funra practices.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.600
 And as well as you also can buy worlds, mind practice,

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.200
 teachers, all other great those books, books and

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.480
 teachings. Those are known as purification practices.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.480
 Ready for powers. Four powers. Ready for power.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.840
 Power of the object, power of the conventions,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:07.000
 power of the restoring, power of the applying the antidotes.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.280
 Those four powers, you can look to the worlds,

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.320
 mind perfect, teachers. Teachers, and I mean many of you already know that,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.480
 with that thought and practicing of the Vedic sago.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:26.200
 It's so powerful, so special, and it is really purificed. So therefore,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.520
 purification is so so important. Then, again, I will talk about that.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.160
 And when we have, when this negative video is happening to us,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.400
 how that happens? In the teachings, there is a false

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.520
 force that will happen the negative videos.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:54.840
 And what force is not knowing what is negative, what is not negative.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:03.640
 First is unknowing. And the second is disrespectful.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:10.040
 Disrespectful. And third is carelessness.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:18.920
 And fourth is too much emotions. Those four are known as

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:28.600
 source of the poor, source of the poor,

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.200
 source of the negativities. Poor, poor of the

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.680
 source of the negativities. Of cause, of poor cause of negativities.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.080
 Maybe that's why, sorry. Poor cause of the negativities.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:51.160
 Again, fourth is not knowing. And the second is disrespectful.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:58.680
 Third is carelessness. And fourth is too much emotions, above all

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.720
 of the emotions. Those are the pro. Pro.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:10.280
 First is that we don't know. That means we can do many mistakes.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:18.040
 So therefore, that is why you should learn, read the books,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.520
 receive the teachings, reflect on that. Make a sense, we are practitioners.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.120
 We should know. Those are what is good, what is

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.120
 really negative. And negativity is generally one.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:38.440
 Again, every talk, the generated Buddha teaching is cause of suffering truth.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:46.920
 It's cause of karma, bad karma. Cause of suffering truth. Cause of bad karma.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.440
 It is cause of fundamental events. He said deep down,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:56.680
 it's cause of samsara. So therefore, we should really know.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:03.080
 Learn the teachings. Read the books. There are so many beautiful books.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:09.160
 Read the books. Some may highlight the principles, the principles, the vows, or the

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:15.000
 guidelines, the negativities. Those are so important.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.840
 So this is the first is, so then when you read, when you started,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.760
 when you also let me contemplate on those meanings, let me in the mind,

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.840
 and in the brain, it will be registered in our memory banks.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.440
 Banks, that you know. We know. So then we won't have troubles of the

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.400
 not knowing. Not knowing. So now I don't know.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.800
 Many times that happened. Even you know. Even those individuals know as well.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:50.920
 But they become they're respectful. Disrespectfuls. Due to their emotions,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.240
 due to their very arrogance, due to their stubbornness,

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:03.000
 stubbornness, whatever reason, they didn't respect it. Respect it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.240
 And therefore, again, should be more respectful,

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.880
 more thoughtfuls. Doesn't matter if it is big

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.400
 negativity, small negativity, it is negatives. Of course, big

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.280
 negativity has big consequences. That obviously, but even small negativity

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.080
 looks like it's small, it has big impacts. And look at this, in the world,

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.760
 small sparking of the pyre can make the big huge pyre

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.880
 destroy the whole valley and the mountains.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.640
 It's happened so many times, at these times,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.640
 in so many different countries. Really, it's started on small.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:53.960
 It can damage it. So therefore, small things, even if it's small things,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:00.760
 we're thoughtful, thoughtful. And should, we should respect, respect

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.200
 and appreciate and don't entertain on them.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.240
 Look to the real, large story of the Buddhas.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:13.880
 Buddha is all-knowing enlightenment. But yet, he's so somewhat, so humble.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.080
 Even this Buddha is already enlightened,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.720
 free from all obscurations, obstacles. Yet, when we read life story or the

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.840
 teaching of Ganyalaya, occasionally, when you have time, read it.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.040
 And how Buddha's reading is so thoughtful,

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:39.560
 so careful, so respectful, so following the common rules.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:46.360
 All those, like 253 rules of the monks, or over 300, whatever,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:52.840
 63 or 62 rules of nonness, all is best upon how to be mindfulness,

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:57.720
 how to respect for us, how to be more politeness and calm and peaceful,

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.400
 to maintain our quality and dignity practices,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.840
 same time, not disturbing others. And that means respecting, okay?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:14.440
 Respect and appreciate everyone's. And move slowly, go gently, peaceful.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:20.200
 Look, toss gently, softly, gently. Look to the eye of love and compassion with

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.640
 others, like smiling, high-pitched, all those of

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:30.840
 what the teaching says. How respectful, how humble, how simple,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:37.240
 how down to the earth, earth, not kind of the same braggio, I'm both completely

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.720
 enlightened, because always, okay, don't, oh, he carry his own,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.720
 carry his own arms, balls, carry his own

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.720
 shoulders, or those, like, ropes, whatever they expect, and those,

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.480
 those. And walking in the great pit, on the dirt

00:42:53.480 --> 00:43:00.280
 roads, that is the gracious kindness, teacher,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.600
 and teacher of the gods, and humanists, and all beings,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:10.440
 the object of generation, with every living being, these great beings,

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.200
 that is really how respectful. So therefore,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:23.080
 be respectful, it's so important. And the third one is carelessness.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:29.720
 Carelessness, this is, again, big tower to us. What we need?

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:36.840
 We need mindfulness. We need alertness. We need consciousness,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:44.760
 conscientiousness. We really need more mindful, more thoughtful,

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.360
 more careful, reflecting the activities,

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:55.560
 since we are practitioners, particularly. Therefore, can we read our activities,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.720
 look to our mind, and how we're performing,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.960
 how we're doing? What any teaching says, you should become

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.760
 teacher to yourself. You should be protractor to yourself.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.120
 You should become assistant, help to yourself.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.720
 Once you receive the teaching, once you receive the, know the teaching

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.000
 quite well, how we sustain that, keep that freshness of the teachings,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.320
 not let get that teaching kind of almost go expiring,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.560
 not let go. How we do? With mind from us, with the alertness, with the

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:37.080
 appreciation. Read our mind, activity of the, our,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.560
 check our activity of the body, activity of the speech,

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.160
 activity of the mind. How is it performing that in a group, in a

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.920
 community, alone? And respect to ourselves, respect

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.160
 with others. Self-respect is so important. Self-respect

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.720
 and self-respect at others. Those ancient great masters in God's

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.680
 musical master say, "Tell yourself of witness, or

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:13.480
 there's true witness, how I'm doing. The witness of others,

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.960
 witness of your own self." We know others witness to you.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.760
 They can guide you just to conduct. They want you how you're doing.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.320
 They won't understand your mind. But I want to count

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.320
 two witnesses. One's own self is the best

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:37.160
 witness. You should check yourself. No matter whatever they say, others,

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.720
 they can say, "Well, many things, all nice and beautiful, these and that things,

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.280
 perfect ourselves." Check that and make our own meaning too.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:52.280
 Meaningful those. Those are known as mindfulness. When you do that,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.760
 it's known as respect. Respect to, you're respecting to yourself.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:05.960
 Respect to others. And calm and peaceful. That is practicing dharma.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.400
 It's not that we're going sidetracked and distracted that.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:19.800
 And so, therefore, this is called the carelessness.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.240
 It will restore the carelessness. We become more thoughtful,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.080
 more mindful, more other than this, and then we will be

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.480
 really good tracks. And then the fourth one

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:40.360
 is not too much emotions. Now, for example, you know all those

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.480
 guidelines, rules, what is negative or what is not negative, all that you know.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.800
 So, you know that. But also, now you are very respectful.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.200
 You know, you're respectful of the teaching and guidelines and all that.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.800
 And also, you're very careful and most time,

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.680
 but once in a while, one of the emotions. Too much emotion, then we slept away,

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.160
 or we fell, we fall in a ditch. Teach. Therefore,

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.520
 always again, too much emotion, therefore,

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:17.880
 always good support with our own mindfulness. That's the teaching.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:23.800
 Always imagine God yourself. Support yourself. Emotions are

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.800
 trouble. It really is just a struggle. Ourself,

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:32.760
 others, and then again, emotion is fundamentally

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.480
 some cause of suffering truth. It creates sufferings.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.800
 It creates the calmness. So, therefore, try to not

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:47.480
 win under the power of the emotions. Even that once in a while, again,

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:54.040
 bounce back immediately and carry that and have some praise, some courage, and

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.640
 commitment. I am not going to do that again. And not

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.080
 that, let me that, not that happened by the blessings

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.840
 of the Buddhas. May I never do that again. Kind of those

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.320
 praise, those things in the mind, reset that.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.240
 That, in the honest end, it will also come.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.880
 So it will not become too much power in the power of the, under the emotions.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.160
 And we have all those ways. Then we are keeping

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.160
 among that morality. We are keeping the perfect moralities

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.640
 of this, avoiding all the negative ways. That is generally, really, really, I'm

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.200
 talking. And also it is on the dungeon, which is,

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:40.360
 you sit here, here, you see, whatever. In the teaching, in the teaching, say this,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.600
 this is so. So then we're keeping this way in here.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.000
 Love and affection for Samayas, brothers and sisters.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.120
 Then we, if we do this, then we're keeping also really

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.800
 perfect Samayas. Perfect Samayas, we keep that.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.360
 Generally, this is the, this is love and affection to

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.600
 Samayas, brothers and sisters. And which is,

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.560
 of course, is all gathering love and affection for all the sentient beings.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.120
 And then particularly love and affection for all the one Samayas,

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.480
 we all in the same Samayas, those are the teachings.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.480
 But this, again, this, we keep this, what I said, this, avoiding all the

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.320
 negative ways. Then we're keeping this Samayas, also,

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.040
 quite very well and beautiful. And I talk this little bit more about

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.520
 this, then, and how this, this. So, so that's my

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.560
 little brief talk today and a little bit of time, so sorry, sorry that

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:44.200
 but okay. Thank you so much.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:50.200
 Okay, now we do short meditation.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:17.520
 [silence]
