00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 Bodhichitta is so really so crucial, important, and we like to get again enlightenment. Bodhichitta

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.540
 is enlightenment.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.860
 Bodhichitta is the enlightenment, when we see now, it's called bodhichi, but when that becomes big,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.540
 then enlightenment, Buddha.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.520
 But in time, our bodhichitta is small because of the old obscurations, but we have to extend and we

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.700
 revere that from the deep of our Buddha-nature, revere.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.130
 For those who don't remember, someone said in one of his teachings, "Lamram Rakeem Tingwa," he said

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.700
, "Love and compassion, wisdom are the mind of the Buddha."

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.600
 Love, compassion, wisdom, are the mind of the Buddha.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 So that means, when we have love and compassion, wisdom, love to ourselves, love to the other

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.500
 beings,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 and compassion to ourselves, compassion to all the beings, and understanding the exact meaning and

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.700
 value and importance of the wisdom of the compassion,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 and the reason to be nice and compassion to everyone, that is the wisdom. That is enlightenment.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.800
 So that means, when we have that mind, really the enlightenment is shining in our heart.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.810
 As, of course, in the teachings mentioned, we all have that. Buddha-nature and the Buddha is

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.300
 residing right in the heart center.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.300
 So that is so important. For that reason, in the great month, Kamala Shala said in his teachings,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:52.730
 he wrote three instructions on the meditation, the first one, the second one, and the third one,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.800
 and all asked by the person of the king.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:06.100
 So he wrote in the second one, and he said, "I don't know how to say it myself,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.700
 but I follow the light of the precious teacher Buddha and will tell you how to express it."

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.900
 He said, "Enlightenment is rooted to the compassion."

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.610
 "Buddha-hood is rooted in the compassion and caused by the body together, assisted by the skillful

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.000
 means, methods."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 "That three combined together will discover the Buddha."

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.500
 So compassion, enlightenment, or the body together, enlightenment is rooted in the compassion.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.800
 Compassion is so important. That means, the body together is rooted in the compassion.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.600
 Compassion for all the beings, all the beings without any discrimination.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 And then body together, we heard so many sounds, do you know?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 Combined with that, what is skill means? I said skill means. That is the meditary activities.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.800
 Akumalaiha Mary was the Mary. That is, as I say, simply, you all know.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 It's six paramata. Six paramata practice is meditary activities.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:32.200
 It is like post three or four are. Post three or four are the Akumalaiha Mary's practices.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:42.500
 Last one, Pandya paramata, paramata, is worship, worship Akumalaiha practices.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.800
 And then some masters said, the concentration in Pandya paramata both are worship marriages.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.400
 But concentration has also concentration with shamatha, without the shamatha.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.500
 Shamatha meditation means with the conceptions, with talk.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.100
 So the worship is beyond the conception.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.440
 Beyond the conception, like Dzokhi meditation, Mahamudra meditation, is beyond the conception, or

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.600
 particularly Dzokhi, teaching.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.300
 Really, according to teaching, is beyond the conception. That is worship.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.700
 So that means generosity practices, morality practices, patient practices,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.400
 and concentration practices, all Akumalaiha Marys.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.200
 And worship of paramata is then worship of Marys.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.900
 Then what about joyful effort to the virtuous paramata?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.200
 In the teachings, that is supported to all the paramatas. Joyful support is supported.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.300
 Joyful support to the virtuous is the fuel of all the paramatas.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:14.200
 All joyful effort to the virtuous is fuel to Akumalaiha Mary, Muslim Marys.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200
 Muslim Mary. So it's a fuel.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:25.200
 Without the joyful effort and courage and commitment in devils, we're not going to do any of those.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.700
 So, therefore, this is what was said. So, therefore, bodhijada is so, really, so, so unparable.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.900
 For those reasons, in the grandma's department, but you also said what they said.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.300
 If you have one thing that's enough to get enlightenment, it's bodhijada.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.900
 If you don't have one thing, no matter how much it's fancy and/or renowned, well-known practice,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.500
 you have, it won't go any path. That is bodhijada.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:02.680
 And so truly unmistakable cause to reach enlightenment is the bodhijada, and I pay homage to the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.400
 bodhijada.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.700
 That's what the grandma's department said. It's really important reason.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:18.600
 Also, zobchin teaching is also named bodhijada. Zobchin practices name bodhijada.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.500
 So that's how, I mean, it's all that, that is. So therefore, bodhijada is, again, very important.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.700
 All the time, really, every time we have that, then our practice, everything really goes well.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.700
 Your application, bodhijada, all comes together, then everything.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 I mean, that's the one gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:48.160
 also, in his teaching, one of the sattaras, two king-personjata of the king of the koshala, koshala

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.500
 or the sarastha now.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.840
 Sarastha came, he said, "Oh, great king, you have so many duties, so many responsibilities, so many

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.900
 chores to do,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.700
 but if you keep one thing, then everything will come."

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:09.370
 All the enlightenment, all the realization will come together. If you keep one thing, and which is

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.700
 bodhijada.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.700
 If you keep one, bodhijada, all the enlightens really will come.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.700
 With those understanding, and then with...
