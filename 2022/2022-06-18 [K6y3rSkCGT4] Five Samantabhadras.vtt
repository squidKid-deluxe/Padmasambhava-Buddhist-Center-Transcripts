00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.550
 This is a board of five different Buddha Samyant Buddhas, five Buddha Samyant Buddhas, and the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.220
 first one is called Buddha Samyant Buddha.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.980
 Buddha Samyant Buddha. Second one is Natural Buddha Samyant Buddha.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:29.170
 Any natural Buddha Samyant Buddha. Third is Everless Buddha Samyant Buddha, or Ground Buddha Samy

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.980
ant Buddha.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 The fourth one is Part Samyant Buddha. And the fifth one is Resolve Samyant Buddhas.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 So this time, this Buddha Samyant Buddha is the Buddha Samyant Buddha, living Buddha Samyant Buddha

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.980
, and the Buddha Samyant Buddha is known as Original Buddha,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.500
 a primordial Buddha, big in the Buddha. The first Buddha. Buddha Samyant Buddha is called a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.980
 teaching.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 Buddha Samyant Buddha becomes the teacher of all the Buddhas.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 And for those reasons, many times, I am the teacher of the teachers.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 Teacher of the teachers. So this is the Buddha Samyant Buddhas.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.980
 How Buddha Samyant Buddhas become Buddha? Since everyone is the same, equal.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 That means we are all the same as equal. We are all the same. One point.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:44.800
 But Buddha Samyant Buddhas got it. Not deluded. We Samyant Buddhas are deluded. That made the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.980
 difference.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 We deluded. Buddha Samyant Buddhas, the fourth Buddha, did not deluded.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 What that actually means? Actually, the nature of our awareness, emptiness, as we said,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:13.980
 the Athangata Garbha, nature, is open, pervasive, inexpressible, emptiness beyond the consumption.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 That's all we learned in this teaching, saying that, and as others.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 But that is filled with the vitality I translated.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 Vitalities or energy, power, potentials.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 So that's not going to stay that way. It's going to activate it.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 That means that the potential is going to activate it. Activate it.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 And potentials are going to be accelerating. The force is there, even though it's undetectable.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 The force is there. But then when the force arises, resenting things are deluded.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 And the Samyant Buddhas, Buddha Samyant Buddhas, immediately discover.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.980
 That instant he reaches enlightenment or becomes the Buddha.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.980
 Those who are in the teaching said, Zouki teaching said,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 six special ways Buddha Samyant Buddhas reach enlightenment instantly.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:44.980
 And the way the energy arises, or the sorrow, or power, energy, when it arises,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.980
 so when it arises, the force arises.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 Second is, when it arises, it's not arising in some different horizons.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.980
 Arising on the right on your horizon of the Buddha's nature, or our horizon of the Buddha's nature.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:10.980
 Nature, when that happens, Samyant Buddhas immediately recognizes this is self-discipline.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.980
 Self-discipline. There's nothing else coming outside, evading us.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 It's self-discipline. Self-discipline.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.980
 And the moment he recognizes, third one, fourth one, sorry,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.980
 the moment he recognizes, immediately he liberated.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:42.980
 Where? Back to that origin, the source. Immediately that is happened.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.980
 And immediately that happened, but also have been fourth one.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.980
 No, Pitman, I think Pitman. Pitman is then recited his own natural status, as it is.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.980
 Even it is happening. That is in the beginning, said,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.980
 Buddha Samyant Buddhas never went out of the old nature.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.980
 Always in the meditative, or always in the natural status.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.980
 It's just within that. Agree?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:30.860
 And then, and now from that, the compassion activities, then Buddha began to emanate so many eman

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.980
ations.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.980
 Even his emanation here, later in the prayer, said,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.980
 I emanated billions of the emanations, no matter whatever.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.980
 They never changed the old nature, exactly as it is.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 That's how the Buddha Samyant Buddhas reach.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.980
 The organ of the Buddha Samyant Buddhas reach in life.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.980
 The moment he sees this one's own nature,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 they call it the teaching, Dokki teaching.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.980
 That moment he completed the old wisdom accumulation meditations.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.980
 Complete wisdom accumulation meditations.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:13.980
 The moment these energies are arising, all this clarity accelerated that.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.980
 And that moment he actualized all the accumulate humanity.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.980
 That instant. This is not the old duration of this.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.980
 This fraction of the instant, very subtle instances.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.980
 We sentient beings of any nature, that energy arises, that arises.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.980
 We did not see that is our own display.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.980
 We began to see, can't we, see here in a letter, in a teaching, say it.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 We feel kind of frightened, in a way.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 Not frightened, pride is big pride.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.980
 But subtle, kind of like intentions of the separation of that.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.980
 External and others, you and others, really begin to come.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.980
 That energy kick. And that is the biggest of duality.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.980
 The strength of the subject, object, division.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.980
 And then we carry that, become more and more expert.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.980
 So this time, this is the buddha, saman buddha.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.980
 The all in the buddha.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.980
 The number one buddha, the false buddha is not number one of buddha,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.980
 or number one number two, no.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.980
 It's not all buddha, same.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 The false buddha is making this prayer and giving us these teachings.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.980
 Then the second saman buddha, I mean, let's do that.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.980
 The second saman buddha is the emptiness nature of the truth.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.980
 All is, the emptiness nature, the absolute nature is pervasive.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.980
 Whether it's a subject, whether it's an object.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.980
 There is no, any kind of discrimination is good or bad.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.980
 Always the same, completely one nature.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.980
 That is a nature.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.980
 And then third one, awareness is saman buddha.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.980
 That is one's own awareness saman buddha.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.980
 One's own rupa.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.980
 Rupa is all in saman buddha to us.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.980
 Our rupa is saman buddha.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.980
 Our rupa is in body number three kayas.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.980
 Our rupa is three kayas status.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.980
 Right now, dharmagaya, sambokaya, narmagaya.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.980
 That is what is rupa is here.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.980
 And then part of saman buddha is because of this original nature we have.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.980
 Now we are activated.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.980
 We're going to glorify it.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.980
 We're going to polish it.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.980
 We're going to refine of this, that means the original rupa.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.980
 Rupa don't have to refine, it's already refined.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.980
 But we are going to take out the layer of the obscurations.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.980
 That is what we created.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.980
 Now we created that.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.980
 We're going to reveal the layers of the obscurations

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.980
 and that will not become the extra dualities.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.980
 We're going to do that line out with the exact nature of the day.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.980
 Those are known as the skippo means the western techniques.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.980
 We're going to take regular practice and accomplish stage practices.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:35.980
 Or the appearance of accumulation of merit.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.980
 And the nami means so.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.980
 Two are western merit, accumulation of merit, western merit,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.980
 skippo means western merit.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.980
 Applying those needs so that will release the negativity,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.980
 not accumulate new dualities, conceptions.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.980
 And then that is part of the sample.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.980
 Then the result of the sample, when we all complete the part,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.980
 the junior complete, we discover our ordinary awareness,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.980
 trikaya, exactly as it is now.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.980
 As we have now discovered without any delusions, obscurations.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.980
 That is the result of the sample.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.980
 So this time, the Buddha, the Samal Buddha,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.980
 the teacher of all the teachers,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
 the Buddha of all the Buddhas.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.980
 In Buddhism, Buddhas are known as teachers.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.980
 Buddha Shakyamuni said, "I am a teacher."

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.980
 How did he say any other than that?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.980
 That was really his teacher.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:51.980
 Therefore, always in Tibet we call Gomba to Giti,

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.980
 the compassion of the Buddha.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.980
 Full of compassion, full of love, full of common sense.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.980
 Drown to the earth, walking with very feet,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.980
 that's what the religious teacher was.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.980
 And holding on to both, in his own hand, walking with students.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.980
 And eat together, and come back.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.980
 And watch in the teaching, watch the dust of the feet,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.980
 and then meditate.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.980
 That's how this great teaching is.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.980
 Wow, that is so teacher.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.980
 So here, the teacher of all the teachers.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:36.980
 Teachers, so that is the...

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.980
 So therefore, his...

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.980
 So that's the problem of icons and operas.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.980
 And then how this nature is...
