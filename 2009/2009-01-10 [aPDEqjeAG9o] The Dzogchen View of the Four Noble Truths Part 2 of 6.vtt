00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.540
 And in that the greatest teacher when Buddha spoke or taught the first teaching is the Four Noble

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.400
 Truths.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.840
 What he said first to his five disciples and all those celestial beings and animals.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:00.080
 First said must be recognized the suffering. Suffering that should be recognized.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 That is what the religious first his teachings.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 This suffering is kind of like under low currents to all the time we are. We all have these suffer

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.200
ings.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.960
 In the samsara of course there is also many good things ahead.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.520
 But the suffering is the highlighted kind of situation in the samsara we go through.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.890
 There is a good things we don't kind of highlight that and it just goes kind of almost goes so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200
 quickly so past very very kind of speed of light.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 But the said and sufferings something difficult that looks like stays long time.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.960
 And for that reason Buddha said first recognize or should see the suffering.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.480
 This suffering again there is many different things sufferings as in the Buddha's teaching said.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.760
 And I mean it's not just teaching said when we all kind of analyze this suffering situation.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 There's three major sufferings often known as then those are the like old pervasive sufferings

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.000
 under low currents sufferings that existing old.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.450
 And there is a second suffering is known as the changeable sufferings and the third is then

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720
 suffering our sufferings.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.260
 This is always we have in the samsara we have that means as long as we have the duality mind

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.280
 grasping the clingings we have this this thought all the time.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.830
 Then beside that there is another sufferings those are known as then such as birth death getting

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.980
 old sicknesses all that we go through this again this suffering or this kind of unpleasant

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 situation.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.140
 This is we that is there that definitely is we cannot avoid as soon as we have the birth we cannot

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.240
 avoid the sicknesses as soon as we have the birth we cannot avoid also the getting old.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.640
 And as soon as we have the birth we cannot also avoid death.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.040
 This is always there these three things or that and beside that then often said in the teaching or

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.000
 not just the teaching we experience it ourselves that we said that the sufferings of the inspir

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.960
ations separations of the loved ones that separated.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.880
 And then also something that are unwanted things are coming one after another and then kind of the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 desirable things are coming one after another.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.300
 And then also for us the body is always something that uncomfortable or need to be always balanced

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.720
 in this and that.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:55.360
 Having separations of the loved ones maybe I said already but anyway we all those are like

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.120
 difficulties the change unpleasurable things that we go through that always.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.440
 Beside that then there's so many other things also can related one after another comes.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.610
 This is the what the part of the samsara this is the part of the result of this this grasping and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.520
 the cleanings that we hold.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.430
 And therefore what the poor that reason Buddha said first must be recognized the sufferings then

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.140
 second he said must be awarded the cause of that suffering cause of that pleasure on pleasure on

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.040
 pleasures is not just happening by itself.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.690
 Everything what we experience we go through it has cause it has conditions by the combination of

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.720
 cause and conditions then it activating that and that's what we call the sufferings.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:55.330
 So cause of those must be said the all source of that must be avoided and we don't like the all

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.770
 these sufferings the change we must be also walk in a deal with the how to avoid that very cause

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.080
 and a condition so that we will be completely totally eliminated not just a cover up things can

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.680
 relate passing through or cover up or trying to put trending.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:23.280
 But we uproot the very cause of that and that's what the gracious teacher Buddha said.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:58.940
 And for that again when we are in the teaching or the gracious teacher when analyzed by Buddha when

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:06.450
 he said these what we are what we were the result comes or this suffering is not just a developing

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.920
 by the no cause and no conditions so that means it has cause and conditions.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.500
 This cause and condition also not just a developing something completely different than the result

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.710
 itself self so it's not just a kind of strange things are developing this result that whatever we

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.160
 experience or whatever the result that corresponding bond with the cause and condition cause and

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.040
 condition what we are things are that exactly correspond result itself.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.480
 The matching is not just kind of odd and end where developing something different things is always

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.920
 respond that respond that and is also not somebody else is drawing these things and then destroy to

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.970
 us is just one's own door and we are experiencing that that must be have something to do with our

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.680
 own self that that's where where the system is.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:12.880
 And then when we look into more that that's what the teacher teacher grace teacher Buddha said is

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:20.720
 all reflecting from this mind mind is the source of all this difficulties and troubles.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.520
