00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 When I went to there and there is not my mother. And all those ladies look like no one I know.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:28.160
 And from that group, two women, one is a nun and the other is my kind of friend, a friend that I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.000
 remember.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 And she came. They both are coming from that group. And they said, "Oh, now how are you? Are you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.000
 okay?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 "And I'm so happy that you're able to come here." They said, "Are you all okay?"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.720
 "And I'm also happy that we met each other." And then I didn't post that to them. And they said, "

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't make post that to me. We are same. Don't make post that."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:20.150
 So then kind of there is a big leader in the group, one leader of all men. So I didn't post that to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 them.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.370
 And then when I went to post that, and this lady said, the principal lady, "Oh, now the time is

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.000
 coming soon to get your treasures."

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And then I asked them, "Are we same?" She asked. And when I asked, "Are we same?"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 And they said, "No, this is not kungabang," she said. They just said, "This is not kungabang."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.140
 And then I said, "I'm Soka City," which is very famous in the Indian. So I'm the Soka City, and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:20.000
 another is Dabhamtari, which is the other Nakhini itself.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 So then they said that it is epic. Then I asked this other one, the big leader, that one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And I told to her, I met again one more post session to her. When I met the post session to her,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 that leader, the principal leader of the Nakhini,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 she rose up in the cushion, and she completely cut her body with curvy knives.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Curvy knives, it kind of looks all red, and I just was so scared with that, I couldn't look.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And I said, "Amma," I mean, it's to be this very custom that they call, "Amma," when they're kind

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 of scared or something, they call, "Amma,"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 she called that, and she kind of moved back. And then all the ladies surrounded by that, they said,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.000
 "Why are you afraid? Why are you saying that?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.510
 Open your eye, look to this." This is the sub-bone medalla of the sub-bone great medalla. It is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.000
 time to just behold that, drop, and open your mind.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.450
 Oh, sorry, open your eye. So when I open my eye slowly, and all these ladies are completely

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.000
 transformed,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 just a regular lady, transformed as like Dabhamtari, gestures, all dressed in different dresses.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And the center of that lady who did that is the Vidyavara house.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.100
 And here in the Vidyavara, her body, her body, all the peaceful wrath we did is all shimmering

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.000
 within her body.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.900
 And she said, "This is the significant empowerment of the Nikinis, and I'm opening, and I'm

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.000
 empowering you, I'm giving you the blessings."

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.150
 And this teaching what I'm giving you, this is the time and where you should spread it, and who

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.000
 will hold, where you will be benefited.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.280
 Those all are in extractions. This teaching is going to open soon, it's going to reveal soon, and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.000
 don't forget that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.750
 And you are my messengers. You will do benefit activities. She said, "That's kind of very loudly

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.000
 storms."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And then immediately, all of those are being transformed into as glowing lights.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.530
 And they can level it up in the sky, sky, in the sky, and there's this sky. And I said to that Nik

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:27.000
ini, the first two Nikinis, that one, Shukasiddhi.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.280
 And she said that, "I'm so happy and so delightful, so delightful, so thankful that you give me all

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.000
 this empowerment in the teachings."

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.150
 But my physical condition as a lady, I don't have all the opportunity to benefit from this, what

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.000
 you want me to do.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 But I can do this, because my condition are the physical conditions, and how I can benefit too.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And this Nikini said, "No, but lady, don't feel sad about being a woman."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Remember what Guru P Vayma Sambha said to you, Nikini Surya asked that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 And Guru P Vayma Sambha said, "Lady, body is supreme body. Lady is supreme ladies."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.570
 By that, there are so many great marriage activities. And also, there are mother of the old Buddhas

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.000
.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But Buddhas is the indestructible true nature. But women is the indestructible true nature.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.840
 Should we always make aspirations to become as women, women or ladies? And everything are taken

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.000
 birth, or are emanating because of the ladies.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.460
 Therefore, ladies are the... All the women are the... What's it called? The spoil or the seed of

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.000
 the Buddha teachings.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 This is the... And this body of lady is not bad, it is the best.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And you never thought that you give up the body of the woman. Always keep this, this body.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And that's what the Guru P Vayma Sambha said. You remember that? So they said that, she said that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.840
 And now, this old teachings that you received, it has varieties of the... different varieties of

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.000
 teachings of the five Gurus.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.700
 And that is hidden, is your share, and you're going to benefit, you're going to reveal that in each

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.000
 direction of this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And soon you will go there, and you will reveal, and going to benefit that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Then, and then again, that reappeared that press for Nakini.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And now I'm going to the Pure Land of the Copper Glory Mountain.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 I am no difference. And you always do keep me in your mind, in your heart.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 I will be always with you, you. And don't, don't upset and don't worry.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And reality level, there's not coming, not going. It's true nature, it's beyond coming and going.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.510
 It's previous nature, rest in that nature, pure from the beginning, that is summoned by the

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.000
 absolute, summoned by the status.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.400
 And she said that, at that moment, everything has disappeared as a rainbow light, and also I woke

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.000
 up.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 So that is Sarananda's dream and the visions, visions of this teaching.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And again, this Saragananda is, of course, her teachings are still not many.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.350
 Again, they say that because of when he had conditions, when he came to this exhibit, not

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.000
 immediately materialized.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And so his teachings are really kind of like, many of those kind of like, disappeared.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 But most of the connected now is existing, and her teachings are so beautiful when I read, really,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 it's so, so clear, so precise.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 And when I read, this is like, same as the world of the kumchimas, kumchimas, doki teachings.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.700
 Teachings, we talk, it's just really like that. I mean, she didn't start, she didn't go toward that

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.000
.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And if academic levels, this is really the sign of this great, it comes like this.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.880
 I mean, just like, their teachings come so flowing, so authentic, so precise, so clear, so powerful

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.000
, powerful.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And that captures the meaning completely, exactly, and very good stuff too, really beautiful.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So that is my great talk about all these great masters.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 We remember, we activate our connection to this great ethos, and which is our practices.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Now we do one minute here.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.160
 (audience applauding)
