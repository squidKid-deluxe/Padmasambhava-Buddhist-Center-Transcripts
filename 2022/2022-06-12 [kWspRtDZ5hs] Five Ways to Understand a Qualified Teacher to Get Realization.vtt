00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The very un-teaching, the whole identity of the world of teaching is always teaching so important.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.110
 They need to show a word. That is no country. But very un-teaching, particularly, don't keep

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:25.490
 teaching. Open method. Method is so important to see a qualified teacher, your qualified teacher,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 your own teacher as living world.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 Really, the un-teaching says, see that un-plemented, un-dearling devotion, when you have to that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.180
 teacher and the leading master, the realization blooms. That is what the un-teaching says. Five

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 points we should perceive the teacher, or five points we should perceive that we should increase

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.000
 the devotion.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:13.370
 Five different ways. Third is that the qualified teacher is the embodiment of the Buddha. That is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:22.310
 the goal. Second, that qualified teacher is the activity of the qualified teacher that is the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 activity of the Buddha. That is the second.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.450
 Third is, that qualified teacher you met, that is even more kinder, more beneficial than the Buddha

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:53.380
. Third, and all the qualified masters, that qualified linear masters, the whole activities, whole

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.000
 activity of the qualified master is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 activity of the Buddha. Fourth, I think. The fifth one, we contract with that qualified teacher,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 with joy, with devotion, with devotion, free from doubt and hesitation, with scepticals. Then,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 without any other causes or reasons, only by that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 you can reach enlightenment, you become enlightenment. Those are really said. Five different ways,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 if you build up the devotions to that qualified teacher, if you have that connection, that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 tremendous power of the devotion and meditation, and this is like such as this.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.700
 This is said, I said, of course, our Tirtha Gaya is within our nature of the mind, but this time,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:05.310
 his form of devotional is embodiment of Tirtha Gaya. Not just Tirtha Gaya, but all the Buddhas, all

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:15.000
 the Vuddhadaras, all the linear masters, and all the enlightenment come together

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.260
 in one single state, or one form, as his or his or the new universe. This is also said, not just

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.520
 the Buddhas or all those enlightened beings of the past, not just only the present, but future. All

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.000
 that comes together as one single state of his or his or the new universe.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.480
 Then, every meditation practices. Then, according to the teaching, the Realization comes up. Those

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.720
 are witnessed by the great Masters, such as Narobas. Narobas contract with the Philobad, his

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.000
 teacher, for according to the teaching, for so many years he did not give any single teachings.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.910
 Only harsh. Harsh, harsh so hard, so tough, in the external level, so mean. There are all things

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:22.000
 trying to really hurt Narobas, but Narobas never linger, never had doubt and hesitation.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 The remaining, his courage, his commitment, his prim, as they call it, diamond mountains.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Then, the end, how he got to wake up to the Realization, according to the teaching, he collapsed.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 He slept. He pulled up his saddle.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 The shoe or saddle, he pulled up and he rolled here and banged to his face.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 The Narobas' face. That moment, the stars came like this and he fell or fell.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 The moment he woke up from their unconsciousness, the Realization, wow, a brilliant sunlight of the

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.000
 Realization is done in his heart.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.700
 So during all that time, his cleansing, purifying, purifying, his accumulation merit, Muslim merit,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.000
 all put together.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.710
 So many times, according to the teaching, 24 big troubles that look addicted to Narobas and 24

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.000
 other small things, all put together.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Put together, troubles or harsh things really did, but he got Realization, perfect.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Realization become the great Narobas, great master.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.360
 And then also, like, in it a bit, or there's another one, like, such as, I mean, many, many,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.000
 according to the teaching, so many.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 But Nala Bodhi, and was the disciple of Nala Juna, and also very dummy.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Nala Bodhi was the disciple of Nala Juna, but very, very so devoted.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 So devoted to Nala Juna, but he can't learn. He's just so dummy, so lonely.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But his path or his devotion is unfailing, so strong, and continually contracted, finally.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And Nala Juna gives something, kind of not really clean, not looking something, he gives that, just

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 a little.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.870
 And he taught us, as blessings, without hesitation, and he adds. Then he becomes the great master,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.000
 realizing Nala Bodhi.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Lo ya satcha in Tibet, really that. And then in Tibet, such as Mararepa.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 He says, you know, he's again Lama Marbha. Great answer to Marbha, but when you read life stories,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 again, how much is tough?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 How strong? Trying to be really too tough, too. All the time.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And yet, not Mararepa didn't linger. And that's it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 His courage, new confidence, commitment, loyalty, loyalty, no matter what you have, his strength.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And then become, you should know, Mararepa, that he knows.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Even the Communists, they don't like the Dharma, they blame. But they appreciate Mararepa.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 That's the way Lama killed me, right, which killed me. Really inspired Mararepa.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 And then, Yungmi Lama, his devotion, Suburbhema Sambabha, and the Lomchimpa.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 So, you know, really renowned. And that practice with death, prevent devotion, practice.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 And the Lomchimpa, he saw three times, and become the Yungmi Lama, Omni Shende Lomchimpa.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Or the second Omni Shende Lomchimpa, or the second Garabdur.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And become one of the great masters, scholars, and Siddhas, thetoms.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 This all shows the son of the devotees. And even master popular register.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 When first, he's one of the very good teacher, principle teacher.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.720
 He kick out, out, and throw on the kregano. And when he woke up, again in the teaching set, he got

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.000
 the realization.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 The first is true teacher. And true teacher, apparently, pointing of nature of the mind as like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 that when you recognize that, it's like the coming dawn on the sky, or the morning dawn, dawns.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 But this master pushed him and kicked on the ground, but that when he woke up from that,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 then before that he got the dawn of the realization, now the sunlight of the realization.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Really kick. All this is.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.780
 With all the devotion, intellectual scholarship won't reach the current teacher, really get

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.000
 realization.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.600
 Even you know, the old Buddha teaching, all the knowledge you have, still will linger on the

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.000
 intellectual level on the surface.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It's not certain. When we receive the blessings, the contract with the devotions, devotions to the

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 master practices,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 then it sings. Then, boom, up the enlightenment, realization.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 So those are the really, and with those thoughts, and then calling Lama Pao.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 That is, as he said this morning, the great Master J.M.M.I. Lama says,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 calling Lama Pao is not just a frame, but it's a devotion.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 You're calling your power over devotions, with joy, with preciousness, toabi, confidence,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 how precious the situation, the circumstance is. It's all magical displays. All things are magics.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Past, present, future will be magic. And now I'm in this magic.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 I'm going to explore the magic of the realization and magic of the blessings.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Really feel so strongly beautiful. Then the realization is come.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.330
 And also for when you walk, then this prayer, or other calling Lama Pao, makes so powerful, more

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.000
 strong,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 more absorbing to the heart.
