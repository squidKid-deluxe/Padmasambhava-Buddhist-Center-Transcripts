00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. And everyone again. And good morning everyone.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.080
 Again, we're going to discuss our motivation, the motivation of the joy and appreciation and

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.200
 gratitude.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 Every reason, we really have a lot of reasons to feel happy in the joy.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And for example, this today is a beautiful day. You see, it's really nice and beautiful day.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Bright sunshine, brilliant sky, and the birds are singing, the wind is good, gently blowing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And right we are here, and we are touching to our core of true nature, our own treasures.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.250
 And with love, with compassion, with kindness, thinking of all living beings in the presence of the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.000
 lineage masters,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.490
 Buddhas, bodhisattvas, all these linear marks that we're surrounded by, all these. And here, we're

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.000
 stating in a way,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 our self to express of the gratitude, happy and appreciation.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 This happy and appreciation, being grateful, is not something exclude or detour of the Dharma.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 This is essence, the cornerstones or the highway of the Buddha.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Buddha is teaching, it's our practices. As the other day, I mentioned, there were about nine points

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.000
,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 and you all know that, maybe, already. Nine points, the great master, Yavu Kundra, listed that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 And this is what really that is, joy and appreciation, combined with devotion and compassion, both

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 each other.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.710
 When we do this, our ego clinging, self-important, it's kind of, went away, and the sight is hiding

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.000
.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 It's now controlling our mind streams, or our brains.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It is, with such a sweet, beautiful quality of our own natural mind, arising from the treasures.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.850
 This is the kindness, compassion, blessings of the gracious teacher, Buddha, and Gharipam Mahasambh

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.000
ava,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 and all the linear masters, we can do this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 We don't have to stay in the midst of the darkness of the ego clinging all the time, as we've been.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 We are going to lighten up. We're making the burst, burst and hold to the ego clinging.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 It's so spacious, the emperor, faithful, grateful, gratitude, all that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.200
 And it's all good with the vastness and motivation of the body together, relative to the body

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.000
 together.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And really, sincerely thinking, may all living with that happiness and calm happiness,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 and then compassion, and joy, and equanimity, those are, again, essence, essence of the Buddha

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 teaching,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 as a treasure of ourself. It's not something coming from out.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Love is not coming from outside. Compassion is not coming from outside.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 It's joy, and it's equanimity. It's all our treasures.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Treasure of the rupa, or the treasure of the three Gaius dead of the mind,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 three Gaius dead of the nature of the mind, we're revealing that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 We left it so long to ignore our triggers from the beginning of this time until we meet the Dharma,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 or we practice the Buddha. In a way, it's kind of carried the force of the external things

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 and met so many levels, one after another, level with grasping, clinging,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 and holding, holding, all that. We're really chasing those things all the time.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 We carry the force of the delusion which is, according to the liturgy,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 is the expression, energy, the expression, energy of the Dharma Gaius or the three Gaius.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 But we hold the grasping, hold, and that can't be communicated.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And now, returning by ourself to that strong, beautiful openness, calm and peaceful.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And that places, we return it back, which is our own triggers, triggers.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And with those thoughts, and then, three Gaya Realizations, or three regular stages.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 On the Vedayana, that's our practices.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 So therefore, we activated those qualities, and then we reflected the teachings.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Now, we've been talking, we are not talking,
