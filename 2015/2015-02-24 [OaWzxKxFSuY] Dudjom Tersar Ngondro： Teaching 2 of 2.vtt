 Again, thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome. Again, welcome. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Welcome,

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:04.000
 everyone. Again, everywhere, wherever you're watching this teaching, I wish everyone is welcome.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.900
 And thank you all for your joyful effort, courage, and commitment and inspiration of holding the

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:17.360
 teaching of the Buddha Dharma. According our best capabilities, your best capabilities, with the

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.680
 devotion and courage and commitment, we're making a difference in our lives and the lives of others

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.000
.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.630
 We're contributing big, big things to the world and to the future. So I thank you to all and every

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:37.680
 of you. Thank you again. And today, we're touching to the teaching of the Buddha, and particularly,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.000
 again, the very basic practices of the Buddha's teachings.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.710
 And not just only those basic things, but also kind of cooperating every teaching into that

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:55.000
 something we can practice, not contradicting. It's nothing but the teaching is contradicting.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.730
 From the day one, his teaching, all the way to his enlightenment or his Maha Pariniran, every

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:08.820
 teaching is very powerful, very special, very practical, and very, very direct teaching that will

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.000
 discover our innate nature and nature of every living being.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.570
 From the context of love, joy, appreciation, harmony, peaceful, nonviolence, that everyone will

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.000
 really like to be that way and appreciate it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.150
 No one is ignored, no one is rejected, everyone is included because this teaching talks everyone's

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:40.400
 nature, everyone's beauty, everyone's good college, how we strengthen, how we bounce back to our

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.000
 nature, how to come back us to home, sweet home, the way really actually we belong.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.240
 That is what this teaching is all about. Therefore, this is very uplifting, rewarding, encouraging

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.000
 teachings, teachings that what we're discussing.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.050
 So therefore, again, it's very special. And it's entirely teaching of the Buddha, bringing one to

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:10.400
 the practices, not just the Hinayana, the Selak, then the Mahayana, Vayayana kind of selected,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.000
 divided, but all the teachings.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.380
 And many great masters you say, and Kenji Padahiram you say, and my father, Lama Chimi, always you

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.000
 say, that every Buddha's teaching, even one single word, don't have to be rejected.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.120
 All is his teaching. Because all is touching to our nature, our truth, our college, and everyone's

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.000
 nature. I'm not just talking our, our, but everyone's teaching.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.220
 Nature is really touched to their core, and their nature itself, to bring up. Therefore, it is so

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.000
 special.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.870
 So today, we started with the very basic understanding of the way the samsara is, such as including

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:57.000
 ourself, started from us, not started from outside, started with us.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Therefore, we touch to ourself, we see how precious our life is. That's what the Buddha said.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 That's it. The precious life. The 18 endowments, or 18 very beautiful qualities that we all have.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.500
 You have, we have, everybody has that beautiful qualities. We glorify that joy, cherish, and just

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.000
 strengthen our joy and appreciation.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.700
 How beautiful life is. How beautiful precious it is. How special it is. It's much more precious

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.000
 than the same size of gold or diamond or the silver things.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.660
 It's much more precious. That we have that. This is a vehicle of many beautiful things to us, to

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.000
 all the beings.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.540
 Therefore, enjoy the beautiful life. Beautiful precious. Recognize that joyful gratitude. That is

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.000
 what we started.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.140
 And then we look around that. Around, everything is also best on the impermanent. Everything is

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.000
 moving.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.360
 Impermanent is nothing bad. Actually, there is impermanent. Therefore, we can progress. We can make

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.000
 the difference.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.860
 If everything is stuck, we cannot do anything. Impermanent shows variety of opportunity, variety of

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.000
 the freedom.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 That's what impermanent is so special. Have you used the right way? It is beautiful.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.210
 Therefore, kind of see everything is changing. Everything is moving. And kind of therefore, have

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.000
 the great courage and commitment to make the really meaningful of this very precious life.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.250
 And then, same time, whatever we do is reflecting back to us. Whatever we do, there's nothing is

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.000
 coming without any cause and condition.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Everything follows with the same orders. And therefore, be thoughtful. Be kind of mindful.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.600
 Every action, trying to do something good, that because it will reflect to us good things and

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000
 reflect that good things to the others.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.750
 And we like to make that really everything is beautiful, bright and good things. That we should

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.000
 start right with us.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.770
 Our own activities, body, speech, mind activities, we do good things, it will reflect back to us

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.000
 good things to all others, not just only us.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.130
 Because our goal is to benefit to all the living beings. Therefore, again, in that goal, do good

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.000
 things.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.140
 And that is known as the law of karma. And then in samsara generally, we look, there's so many, all

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.000
 these difficulties and changes, ups and downs.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.650
 This is nothing that we're talking again, new things, but it's truly, it is. We have all different

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.000
 things.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.540
 Because this is, also samsara has a lot of these difficulty troubles and a lot of change. Therefore

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.000
, we can really progress.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.370
 We can develop that. Because this is, in a way, the samsara is filled of trainings where we can

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.000
 train ourselves.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 We can make ourselves strong. Everything is good and all these things. We won't progress anything.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.460
 We will become, we'll become almost very soft and very kind of like marshmallows, unusefuls. Really

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.000
, we'll become that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.890
 So therefore, samsara has heart and difficulty and challenging things. And we keep up that with

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.000
 courage and commitment and confidence with teaching.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Heart, we will become so strong. We will become the warriors. We will become the bravery.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.230
 And a warrior not just comes from not doing anything, bravery in a warrior comes with doing good

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.000
 things, move with challenge, overcome that.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.550
 Then, that is known as the warriors. That's what in the Buddha teaching, bodhisattvas, courageous

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.000
 for the enlightenment, courageous for all the living beings.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.350
 Truly, that is what it is. So samsara is not something that bad in things. Again, we use this

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.000
 situation, circumstance, that we can prove.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.220
 And that is also not just that we can prove. And what's witnessed by all these great practitioners

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.000
 in the past, all those bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas, everyone.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.880
 They are also facing this same situation in circumstances that because of that, their courage and

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:17.000
 commitment, confidence, visions are not wavered or shaped, but even stronger and more powerful.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And then they become as enlightenment, bodhisattvas and so forth.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.860
 So therefore, this is what the four reflections that reverse our mind from the kind of timidity

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.000
 situations, very feeble situations.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.790
 It makes us stronger and courageous ones. And after that, once with that understanding beautifully

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.000
 and kind of help that knowledge very goodly, strongly, and then we take the rafugis.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.540
 Rafugis is the root of the teachings. It is that every root of the path is best on the really rafug

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.000
is, so that's the rafugis.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.110
 Close to the, feeling with, to the dha, the dharmasanga, essence of rafug, as I said this morning,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:07.420
 it is devotions, devotions and strong devotions, closeness, feeling with the bodha, bodhas and d

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.000
harmas and sankas.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.180
 Once we take the rafug, then essential of the path, or the central column of the path, path is bodh

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.000
icata.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.710
 And bodhicata, as I said, and you best remember, we already know this, bodhicata is love, bodhicata

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.000
 is completion, bodhicata is wisdom.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Combined together, all that beautiful things is known as bodhicata, the enlightenment.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 This bodhicata is so important. Without the bodhicata, we will not become the Buddha.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 That means we will never become overcome of our obscurations. What is obscurations?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Obscurations are ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, and arrogance.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Without the bodhicata, we will not overcome and remove these five obstacles. Never overcome that.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.210
 And also without the bodhicata, we won't help benefit to any sentient beings. Not just only

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.000
 sentient beings, we won't benefit to ourselves.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.480
 Bodhicata is essential. To make happy ourselves, one's own self, to make happy others, to make

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.000
 peace for ourselves, to make peace for others, that is bodhicata.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.390
 That means it's love, it's completion, it's wisdom. And for that reason, the great Master Padra Ram

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:40.000
aji said, as Kinti Padra Kheramaji used it many times, quotations, what Padra Ramaji says,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.530
 "If you have one thing that will end up to reach the Buddhahood, or to defeat all the negativities,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.000
 it's bodhicata."

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.300
 And we don't help bodhicata with no matter how much practice you have, how many fancy practices you

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:58.000
 have named. All this, it's not going to work at all.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.370
 It's all within the ego territories, attachment territories, all emerging territories. It's never

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.000
 going to work. As explained that.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 So for that reason, the bodhicata is so important, so special, so powerful.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.140
 Bodhicata is what that bodhicata as he said this morning. It's simple, simple, beautiful, call it

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.000
 our own true love, true completion, true wisdom.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.680
 That is what bodhicata. But we are going to expand that. Expand that without any territories of

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.000
 dualities and happiness and happiness.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.370
 And to all the beings, true love, to all the beings, comparison to all the beings, and have an

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:51.000
 understanding of the nature of everything, both externally and everything, wisdom.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.180
 That is bodhicata. Way to develop this bodhicata in the Buddha teaching said, there are many

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:05.000
 different explanations, but which is mostly very powerful, more direct, there are true bodhicata.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.880
 Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata as I said this morning, and many of you know that. Bodh

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:22.000
icata. Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.390
 Something that you wished in the heart and mind. As we wished in the heart and mind, we are going

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:36.000
 to actualize that with the physical activity, with verbal activities, we are actualizing that.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 That's called actualizing bodhicata. Now, we think of wishing bodhicata. What is wishing bodhicata?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.620
 All wishing bodhicata can be summarized into four. Again, many of you know that practice. We all

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.000
 know that. This is called poor boundless practices.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Poor boundless practices of bodhicata. That is wishing bodhicata. Poor boundless.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:15.030
 What are the four boundless? It is just our name. You all know. Love and kindness, compassion, joy,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.000
 and equanimity. Understand.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 This is four special qualities of our nature of the mind. Love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:41.310
 This is. And what means boundless? Now, we are going to present time our love, compassion, joy, and

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.000
 equanimity is with bounded.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.820
 These present times, or many of us present time, is bounded because of ego-clinging, because of the

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:58.000
 habitu pattern, because of duality, is very limited.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 That is not boundless. It is limited. It is bounded within the boundaries.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.720
 But when we are really genuinely developing this boundless bodhicata, then we are going to break

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.000
 that borders and territories, that wall.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.440
 That is what is called boundless. It has no border. It has no limitation. No restrictions. It is

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:36.000
 outreaching. Call it of love and compassion, joy, and equanimity.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 To all the living beings, 365, what could it be? 365 degree angles. Every direction is pervasive.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Not just only now, but also on the future, time.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 All the way future, to everywhere. So there is no division by the space, no division by the times.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 It is beyond the time and the space of that.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.130
 That is called boundless. Love is beyond. When emanating that love, beyond the space and time, and

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.000
 as well as compassion, as well as joy, and as well as equanimity.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 That is called boundless. And also, what is boundless? What means boundless?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.440
 We are also reaching this love and compassion, this boundless call, to all the sentient beings, to

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.000
 every sentient living being.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.140
 And a number of the sentient beings, how many are there? According to the Buddha's teaching,

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.000
 countless. There is no count.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.420
 And therefore, our love and compassion, and joy, and equanimity has no count. There is no, not that

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.000
 many.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 It is countless. It is boundless. It is limitless. That is what we are reaching.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 As that much, our heart, your heart, is open like also limitless, boundless, vastness.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 So then, object level, where is that touching, is boundless. Where is coming, is boundless.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And then, not just that. What is power of that? It is also boundless.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.370
 Power is boundless. Power, love, and compassion, versus them, is boundless. There is no count. It

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.000
 is boundless.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 And your where coming, coming from, is boundless. Anybody can tell the border of your mind or mind?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:55.530
 No. Nobody can tell the border of your mind, depth of your mind, territory of your mind, or our

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.000
 mind, my mind, your mind.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 It is boundless. As it is boundless, we are opening that boundless God, exactly as it is.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 And boundless to the beings, boundless resource, and boundless benefit, result.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Therefore, it is known as boundless, power boundless. Power boundless.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And you all know, what is love now? Love is, is lovely, beautiful, something very pleasing.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 That is love, love. So all the sentient beings, everyone is something pleasant, beautiful.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Again, everyone has beautiful qualities, qualities, no matter whatever they are, in the situation,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 in the circumstance.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.790
 But reality is so special, so beautiful. It is a display of their own beauty and the nature of

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.000
 their times.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:01.490
 It is so beautiful. And seeing that beauty as it is, and then you match that, that beauty, call it

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.000
 this, your love and compassion.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Appreciate that. That is loving kindness.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.020
 Also, without the sentient beings, for example, without the others, we are not going to improve

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.000
 ourselves.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Without the sentient beings, we are not going to become the Buddhahood.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.640
 For example, according to Buddhism, Buddhist point of views, we are not going to become the Buddhah

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.000
ood.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 For that reason, many great masters, and you see, as well as there is very famous master known as

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Karma Chami, very famous master.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 He said, there is no difference between Buddha and sentient beings to become ourselves the Buddha.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.860
 Buddha shows the path and techniques, and the sentient beings show the direct training of our

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.000
 practices.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Without the sentient beings, we are not going to become the Buddhahood.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.690
 Where are we going to practice the four boundless? Where are we going to practice the six paramatas

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.000
?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Without the sentient beings. So therefore, both are in that level.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Kind, Buddha is kind, or Buddhas are kind, sentient beings are kind.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 This kindness of beings, then beautiful, spiritual, to love to them.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 That is really about loving kindness, love. And what is compassion?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.740
 Compassion is, when you love someone, and love the one having some difficult troubles, experience

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.000
 difficult troubles,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 you like to be supportive, help, and ease their difficulty in the troubles.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.210
 You like to sincerely like to help. For example, when we love our children, or our families, our

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.000
 relatives, our friends,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 if they are having difficult troubles, you really sincerely like to help them.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 You like to remove their suffering, the difficult, ease their troubles. So whatever that,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 echo to your best capabilities. That is compassion.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 It is outreaching, reaching mental, beautiful activity, that like to ease their troubles.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 That is compassion. Like to remove their sufferings. Sincerity reaching that.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 And then, what is this? Joy. Every human you love, you love the ones having good times,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 or they are having beautiful performance in their lives.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 We should feel joy. We should appreciate. How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And even they are, I mean, whatever they have good performance, enjoy, kind of appreciate that.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 That is known as joy and appreciate. Kind of joy and appreciation.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 So, performance with every sentient beings. Every being. And that is joy.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And the equanimity. Again, the equanimity has different others.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Many of you all know that has many different meanings.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 But in this case, the equanimity means just we are all equal. Everyone is equal.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.450
 There is nothing any difference between me and you, and others, or he, or he, she, and everyone is

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.000
 equal.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Biological, we are equal. Feeling level, equal. And what we share is equal.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 I mean, there is nothing really difference. We live in the same, on this earth.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 We breathe the same air. We have the same sunlight, same moonlight, same thing.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And we eat the similar things. Food that which gives from the mother earth.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Mother earth, and there is nothing. And our feeling level is the same.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 We like to be happy, joy, peace. And we don't like to be suffered, sad, and difficult.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And, tormented by anyone, or used, used, take advantage by anyone.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 So, we are same. Whether we can speak that feeling, whether we can't speak the feeling.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 But, same thing. The desire is the same.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.840
 Destination is the same. We like to be happy, joy, and peaceful. So, everyone is the same. That

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.000
 means.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And bring that understanding equal. Everyone is the same.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Therefore, like to be happy, and joy, and peace, may they all have that.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 This is known as the poor, boneless. And how to put that in practice?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 We have beautiful practices that you all have. You know all know. Most of you all know.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 This is called poor, boneless practices, which is taught by great masters and buddhas.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Masters taught how to say that word. To activate that quality. And glorify that.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And first is, again, love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 May all, firstly, how to activate loving kindness, boneless loving kindness.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 May all living beings have the great happiness and cause of happiness.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 That is practicing of the loving kindness, boneless loving kindness.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 May all living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 So, that means you are praying to have everyone's happiness now.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 But not just only now. Last forever. And forever, that is cause.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 If there is cause and conditions, it will then continue, continue the happiness.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 If there is no cause and conditions, then we could end up opposite of that.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 So therefore, sincerely wishing that for our drift of heart,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 wishing may all living beings have the happiness.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Every living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 And cause of happiness, what is cause of happiness?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Cause of happiness is love. Cause of happiness is joy.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Cause of happiness is appreciation. Cause of happiness is kindness.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Cause of happiness is wisdom. They have always that quality in their heart.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.240
 Without the disturbed by the ego clinging, without the disturbed by the habit patterns, always

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.000
 shine their heart.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.120
 If that shines their heart, the activity of the will be physical activity will be the activity of

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.000
 loving kindness, compassion, kindness.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 And their verbal communication, speech will be that with the speech of kindness, compassion, love,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 and then everything will be beautiful.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 Everything will be happiness, result will be happiness, cause of happiness.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 We are wishing that sincerely from our heart. Heart.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 That is what is called the practice of the boundless love.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.180
 And that is not just only one, not two, not three, not hundred, thousand, and tens thousand, or

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.000
 millions, or all the trillions or billions,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 but all the sentient beings. That's what we took.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 May all the living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.480
 Many times in the Buddhism teaching said, may all the parent living beings have the happiness and

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.000
 cause of happiness.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.320
 And according to the Buddha's teaching, this life what we have now is not just the first time we

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.000
 came here, nor it will not be only last.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:30.700
 This life is just a life. One of them. Now we are moving lives. We are continuing, garland of lives

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.000
.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 And most of the time when we take the life in this samsara, we had the parents. Most of the time.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.980
 Actually there is in the Buddha's teaching, there are four different ways to take the birth in

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.000
 these realms.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:55.060
 Among that, the parent taking birth with parent is one of the very popular ways to take the birth

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.000
 in this life, in the samsara.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Yeah, it is. And therefore, every living being, according to the Buddha's teaching, once at a time,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 one way or the other, being our parents.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And therefore, among all the beings, the parent is considering very kindness.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.900
 Particularly within the parent in the Buddha's teaching many times said as you read too, motherly-

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.000
centered beings.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:33.780
 Mother is most challenged to upgrowth of our where we are. Most of the time, she pulled us ten

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.000
 months in the warms, or nine months.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And during that time, so many difficulties, so many challenges, so many things went up and down.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:55.210
 But she never wavered her compassion, her love to her upcoming babies. She always with joyful, she

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.000
 always excited to see that.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.010
 And then, when we take the birth, also mother went in the Buddha's teaching and Gurbi and Masambha

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.000
 teaching said that time,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 mother and child will go almost halfway to the death. They have so many difficult challenges.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.460
 But still, mother didn't wave with difficulty, mother didn't blame. And she continually uphold and

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.000
 looking forward to see that.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.280
 And then, when we were born, we don't know anything, anything, anything. We don't know, know

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.000
 anything, our future.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.470
 We don't know anything in our past, completely blended, except what we know. We're crying, crying,

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.000
 that.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:46.220
 But again, mother joyfully accepted and nourished, cut the course between her and that babies with

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.000
 joyful,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.350
 joyfully and nourished, and give tender love and compassion and feed our with the breast, breast

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.000
 feedings.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 All those things in the Buddha's teaching said, mother is one of the kind and most kindness beings

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 to us, to upgrowth what we are now.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 At that time, mother neglected, mother through, we won't be like this, what we are now. We won't,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 won't.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 I'm sure, of course, mothers are not enlightened beings. They can take some mistakes.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Even with what's called without knowing, sometimes they can make mistakes. Unaware, unaware,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 sometimes mistakes.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 That can't be. But however, deep down, mother being so kind, so nourished, so simple. Every time,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 all the way upgrowth, growth.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:45.200
 And sometimes, I mean, you all know that. When we become babies, even if we start walking, there

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.000
 will be one or two steps.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.120
 How mother will say, oh, my parents will say, oh, now this, my baby is walking. My babies start

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.000
 walking.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 They're kind of excited. Otherwise, what a big deal, walking this, this, in one way.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 But because of what they love, their kindness, their concern, their appreciation, what they have,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 even they're walking.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.940
 Walking, they will say, oh, now start walking. That become the kind of, almost kind of history,

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.000
 even for them.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.550
 That is how, that, that means they kiss. And then when we go to the bathrooms, let's go to poo-poo

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.000
's, poo-poo's, see that.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.580
 And we started really doing the regular way of poo-poo's. Oh, now they're doing the poo-poo's right

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.000
 there.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.140
 I mean, this is all, this is true. This all shows how efficient they have, how loved they have, how

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.000
 kindness they are.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Truly, that. If that and they neglect and they grow something, drop somewhere, we won't be like

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 what we are now.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.850
 Now, now, so all this, when you look back, it's kindness. And therefore, in Buddhism, it's kindness

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.000
, kindness sent in beings and motherly sent in beings.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.090
 And this motherly sent in beings, now we are kind of going to stone, good, alert, through their

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.000
 kindness, their supporters.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Now we like to pay back to their kindness. We like to repay gratitude to them.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.420
 And that even we couldn't do anything physically or that. But we think that this is the way what we

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.000
 started to benefit, to help with all the sent in beings.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.940
 Sent in beings. This, we say so. So, may all the sent in beings have the happiness and cause of

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.000
 happiness.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:30.370
 And then second is the boneless compagant practices. Boneless compagant practice is, then, may all

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.000
 living beings, or may all motherly sent in beings,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 prefer them sufferings and cause of sufferings. Prefer them suffering and cause of sufferings.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.660
 And now, what is? Again, we are thinking that not now, only now, but in the future, there is no

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.000
 more sufferings.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 So, there is no more sufferings. What is that? Then is happiness. Then is beautiful and joyful.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Then, what is cause of sufferings? Cause of sufferings, again, is negative emotions.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Negative emotions, such as ignorance, attachment, and anger, and jealousness, and arrogance.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Those are the cause of sufferings. Those are the cause of sufferings with the combination of that.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.170
 When it acted verbally, when physically, and also even mentally sizzling in the heart and mind, it

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.000
 makes uncomfortable.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.720
 It makes sufferings to anyone, in that individual state. When it is reflected externally, then it

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.000
 becomes disastrous, unhealthy things.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 And then it creates a suffering. That not ended there. It is, we plant the seed. We started just,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 started that.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.250
 It goes on. That's the called law of the Skarmas. When you plant the seed, for example, fruit,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.000
 fruit seed,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 one seed fruit, we plant it on the ground. How many fruit from that will bring?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 One orange seed will bring hundreds of the oranges, one up and out, and less.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 As long as the conditional circumstances there, it will bring continual oranges, year after year,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 year after year, each time.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.810
 Hundreds of the oranges. Similarly, that's the seed. When we started, it will bear the similar

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.000
 fruit, that.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:42.180
 And therefore, we like to remove that. That cause of the suffering is anger, and the jealous, and

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:48.000
 the attachment, and ignorance, and arrogance, and combination of those all.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 That is what it is. So, we think that. And then the next is joy. Joy.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.580
 May every living we have the great, always have the great joy, never separated from supreme

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.000
 happiness.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 And that is, and basically the same, meaning is the same, causes the same as love and kindness.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.240
 Then may everyone has great realization of the economy. First, the economy realization can be all

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.000
 equal.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.920
 Everyone is equal. Then in the deeper level, relative truth and absolute truth, everything is in

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.000
 one equal state.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.310
 There is nothing really different. All equal. So, everyone has great realization of equal, name it

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.000
 in their heart and mind.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Sincerely, kind of wishing that, and saying this word, is called practicing of the Four Boneless.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.280
 And when you put that in action, this Four Boneless practice in action, actualizing these Four Bon

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.000
eless, then what is called?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:02.970
 Those tony practices. The many of you know that. Tony practices. Exchanging, reserving, and sharing

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.000
 or giving.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Those all tony practices are activating the Four Boneless practices.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 And first, again, to do this, we are all equal. That is very important.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 We are all equal. Same way, feeling, emotion, psychologically, physically, biologically, all equal.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 Kind of spring that equal realization, equal understanding. It's true.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 And secondly, since no one likes to be half sad and suffering, everybody likes to be half in peace.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 And therefore, when anybody is experiencing that difficult troubles, then you start giving your joy

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 and happiness to others.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 And if you are courageously, then receiving their difficult troubles to back to yourself.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Self. That is called tony practices. So, tony practices is activating Four Boneless practices.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.980
 Mentally, which is so powerful, so beautiful, so spacious. This tony practices. There are so many

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.000
 stories.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 When you practice of tony practices, when you practice of this Four Boneless practice,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 even mentally, that thing is really sincere in your heart. Mind is so powerful.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 It is healing. It is purification. It is cleansing. It is removing all obscurations.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.360
 It will then advance our realization. This Four Boneless practice is so powerful, so special, so

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:38.000
 natural, so authentic, so pristine, in a way.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Really, such as no negativities and ego-clinging, kind of stains. It's just so beautiful.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 And therefore, this is so spiritual. And in the Buddha's teaching that once upon a time,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Buddha was born as one... I mean, again, this is a long story. I will make this short.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 But have you experienced so many difficult troubles, one after...

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 I mean, first he got so many good things, one after another, that once upon a time,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Buddha was born as a merchant who goes to the ocean.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 And then Buddha went to the ocean at that time. It's not that time, Buddha.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 But it's called... His name was Nzahri Pomo. And Nzahri Pomo went to the ocean,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 and the mother really said, sincerely, "Please don't go to the ocean."

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 And my husband and your father died in the ocean.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 "I don't want you to go to the ocean. Ocean. And please don't go."

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 And he is determined to go to the ocean because that is what he likes to do.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 What the father did, he likes to do the same way.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 So finally, he just said, "Mother couldn't stop."

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.460
 And even mother hold his legs, legs trying to prevent to go. And he kicked to the mother, and he

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.000
 leapt.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Otherwise, he was so kind and so obedient to the mother.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 But that day, he just leapt, kicked the mother, and then he leapt with his friends to the ocean.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 And he can time in the story, there are so many times Pomo goes to the ocean

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 to get the jewel and to get the treasures. So he leapt.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 So, you know, in the ocean, and there's a big hurricane, or the second came,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 and that boat was upside down, and everybody was completely start sinking.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 And the manipulables survived, and then one of them, that time, he was.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 He was survived because he hold a piece of the wood from the ship,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 and holding that, and kind of swing with that.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 And then he went experiencing the different kind of those islands.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 He had a good time in one after another, but still he like to go to the south.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 Kind of like southern is his hobby, to go to south and south.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 So up each time, in the sea, he had indicated, "Don't go south. Don't go south."

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 But he went south, one after another.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Finally, he reached to the one big, what's called, big iron house, has only one door.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 He was so curious, he like to go inside.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 And some kind of also indication, "Come, you shouldn't go inside."

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 And he just, even that indication, he didn't kind of like trust him or follow that indication.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 He like to go to see what is inside of that big, iron house, and one door.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 And when he went to that iron house, the doors, the door immediately shut down.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 So now he was inside. He can't go away.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Inside, there is one man, completely, kind of like, swollen.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 He's standing there, and kind of like will is going to his head.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 Will is going to his head, like spinning will is going to his head.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 And he's also really kind of completely, what's called, smashing his brains, that is so.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 He thought, "Oh, so terrible how that happened."

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 Happened. He kind of really sincerely compared to that.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 But same time, he's scared, he like to run away from that.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 But he couldn't go because the door was shut.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 Immediately, in the sky, the sky kind of came to sound.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 What is bounded, released, which is not bounded, bounded.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 That sound came in the sky, or in the space.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 That happened, the moment that will release, that person's, immediately,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 and that will came on his head, and that almost head,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 who was former life of the Buddha.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Now his head is spinning, and then it becomes so uncomfortable, so painful.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 He was scared, and just frightening that.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 But as soon as that happened, then he got the courage.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 He thought, "Oh, I'm just one person that happened.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 How many people go like this?

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 What I'm happening, may this become the substitute

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 to every living being's pain and sufferings with headaches,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 and anyone who is going through this, and by this."

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 And they never sent him being experienced any headaches,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 headaches, and head troubles, such as a life.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 "May I will take everything. May all that come to me."

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 He had that sincerely bodhicitta thought.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 That moment, the spinning well, went up in the sky.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Sky, and that become the will of the flower garland.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Garland, and he was released.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 So this is one of the stories of the wishing bodhicitta,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 and particularly, pony practices.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 That is so powerful, so special, so healing.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 So that is the really about the wishing bodhicitta.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 Now we talk a little bit about the actualizing bodhicitta.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 When we actualize this bodhicitta, how we do?

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 This is called six paramita practices that you basically all know.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So I'm not going to talk about these things.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 But six paramitas are, what are just the list of names,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 generosity paramitas, and morality paramitas,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 and patient paramitas, jury effort paramitas,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 and concentration paramitas, and wisdom paramitas.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Those are known as six paramitas.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Paramita, what that means, Sanskrit language,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 transcendental, I think, that translated into English.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 So transcendental practice of the generosity,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 transcendental practice of the morality,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 transcendental practice of the patience,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 transcendental practices of the jury effort,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 transcendental practice of the concentration,

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 transcendental practices of wisdom.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Those are known as six paramitas.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 Six paramitas are, that means,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 six paramitas are best on the poor, boneless.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 Wishing bodhicitta is what you wish.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 But when that activating in the externally,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 really physically, with verbally, with mentally,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 then this is the six paramita.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 So nature of the six paramita is poor, boneless.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Its love, its compassion, its joy, its equanimities.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 That is what the six paramita is.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Six paramita is not just separated from that.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Generous practice is best on the poor, boneless.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 And morality practice is best on the poor, boneless,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 and the patient, and so forth.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 All that is completely rooted, best, is inseparable.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 This, with the poor, boneless.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 And poor, boneless is the essential, essential of that.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 And every practice cooperated with that.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 That is known as activating bodhicitta, bodhicitta activities.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 And that is basically practices of the bodhicittas.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 And with this realization, with that understanding,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 and then we join these prayers here.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And page thirty, page thirty, here I say,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 "From now until the samsara becomes empty,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 I shall have a complicated benefit and happiness,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 all the sentient, barren beings."

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 That is, that is what you will say.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 You will say these prayers sincerely from the heart and the mind,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 in the presence of the S.A.A.A. in the teachings,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 beseech the object of refuge, be witness, and then join this prayer.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 Fill the presence up.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Object of refuge is as in God of Amma Sambo, Buddha Shakyamuni, Dara,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 all the Buddha's body is at every level.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 Even in the great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 "You can fill the presence of all the gods and asuras,

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 everyone right in front, every in front."

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Even you can kind of feel all the sentient beings are right in front of you.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 They are watching you. They are hearing you, what do you say?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 They are seeing your intelligent thought.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 You will say that.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Truly, we are not lying.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 We are not just a kind of a patron,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 sincerely relieving that from our deep heart.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 That is what is known as bodhicata, Mind of Enlightenment.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 This is the essential, essential of the entire practices.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Whether you practice samatha meditation,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 whether you practice mudro practices,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 whether you practice zogchen,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 whether you practice mahamudra practices,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 this bodhicata is the essence.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 This is the center columns that we really feel that.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 And bodhicata is, then, as the essence, is four bones.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 And then, when we activate that, six parameters with that.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 So that is we've joined. We've joined, and that's all.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 So this is really about bodhicatas.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 Now, we move to the, to this mandala offerings.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 Generally, now, of course, this mudro practice is

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 the very kind of instructions of the kind of big, long practices,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 the long practices that, this I'm talking now here, that.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 But when we put practices, you just put each time, for example,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 raffudy wantra, bodhicata.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 Raffudy and bodhicata generally always comes to every practices,

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 then you can focus.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 And then, mandala offering, regasattva, and so forth.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 So you can select those practices,

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 start with this raffudy and bodhicata,

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 as well as that poor training of the mind,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 poor reverse of the mind, that you can reflect that thought

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 for maybe a few minutes.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 And with that, raffudy, bodhicata,

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 and then you can focus each of the mudro practices.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 So that is generally that.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 Of course, now, today, I'm talking all of these, that.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 So it's kind of like, this is a little more, kind of longer,

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 the detail there, but that's how it is.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 And now, we move to the mandala offerings.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 Mandala offering is, is now, it is

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 spiritual practices of the vedayana teachings.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 Vedayana teachings generally known as vat.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 Of course, the Buddha give the vedayana teaching,

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
 vedayana teaching, vedayana teaching,

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 every summary is that way.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 So there is vedayana teachings.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 So, raffudy is the start of teaching in vedayanas.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Bodhicata is the start of teaching in the vedayanas.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 And the mandala is as vedayana teachings.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000
 Within the vedayana teaching, every teaching we practice,

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 we not really excluded that, anything.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 So we practice raffudy, we practice bodhicata,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 then we practice vedayana teachings.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 And vedayana teaching is what?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 Always known as full skill means, and a lot of wisdoms.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
 So combination of the skill means, the wisdoms,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 that makes kukri to get our enlightenment,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 or to discover our beautiful nature.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 And that is what's called the reach of this.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 Vedayana teachings.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
 And vedayana teaching has a lot of skillful means practices.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 This mandala is one of the skillful means practices.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 Very powerful practice, skillful means, looks like simple,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
 kind of like very casual, but yet is so effective,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 so powerful to increasing the merit

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 and removing the obscurations, negatives.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 And increasing, increasing to remove the obscurations,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
 that means to remove our habit pattern,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 negative habit pattern, unhealthy habit pattern,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 unwholesome habit pattern, we need more merit,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 or good energy, good energies.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
 This good energy is known as merit.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 Merit is, is, then there is two kind of merit.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 A Buddha's teaching, you see that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 Merit, merit that comes from the activities,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 if I put simple kind of words,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
 merit, merit that comes from the known activities, merit.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
 So that means the energy, the good energy that comes

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
 from the good, good activities,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 energy, good energy that comes from known, nothing, no activities.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 There's two ways to come.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 And what is good activities?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 Such as best upon devotion and bodhicata.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 Anything good activity we do, that well-generating, then merit

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
 that comes from the activities.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 What is merit comes from the known activity?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
 That is simply meditating.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 Meditating, meditation has nothing that we do.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 In particular, we rest in the nature state of the mind,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 or nature status.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 Those are known as shamatha, vibhachana, or zokhi meditations.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 We relax on the nature status, not doing anything.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 But equally, just simply relaxing.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
 That also will gain the merit.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 So there is a true way to gain the merit,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
 to remove the unwholesome habit patterns.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 That started with the, unwholesome habit patterns,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 started with ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 hatred, thought, and arrogance.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 That will remove, cleanse, and purify that.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 And so this mental offering is merit

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 that was generated with activities, activities.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 This, of course, now to do this, this,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 and then there's, again, to explain in many ways.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 But, and maybe I just today talk simple ones.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 Simple one is then, this is the Madala Mudras.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
 Mudras, that I think many of you already know this.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 This is the Mudra.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 Mudra is what, I think, if I translate roughly into English,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
 is symbols.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 Symbol or the signs.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
 These are symbols.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 These are the symbols.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 But the symbols are generally so powerful, so special.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 If we are highly intelligent, by the symbol we understand everything.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
 Symbol art.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 That is in the Vedayana teaching, in the particularly new material world,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 called symbolic transmission lineage.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 Everything by the symbols.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 There is no talks, verbal communication, this and that.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 By the signs and indication, everything is clearly understand.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
 Everything completed this.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 And this is called symbols.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
 And then in the mundane world, also symbol is so important.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 For example, to symbolize the United States, of United States.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 What is the national flag?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 I mean, there's maybe many symbols.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 But one is national flag.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
 National flag symbolize entire these great countries.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 It is a big symbol.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
 And that kind of, all those who know, can tell all these stories.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 From that symbol of this, what's called the star springer,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
 springer banners, star springer banners.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 You can tell all these stories.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
 That is a symbol.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 I mean, symbol is so powerful, so special.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 It has big meanings.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 And in the Vedayana teaching, there are so many symbols.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 Symbols.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
 And among that, this is called mandala symbols.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 And mandala symbol is symbolize, lies at this time.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 For example, entirely universe.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
 This is a symbol.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 This looks like kind of very simple.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 I mean, of course, it's simple.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
 Simple.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
 But yet, it is so effective, so powerful.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 It is in whole universe.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
 That symbolize by this.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
 This.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
 That is what offerings.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
 But then, of course, whole universe.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 Universe what?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 It's called outer universe in inner universe.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 This symbolize all that.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
 Outer universe, inner universe, whole universe

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
 without any exceptions, without any left behind.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
 Exclude anything.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
 It is symbol.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 This is the universe.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
 At this time, what is this?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
 For example, there is five things.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 Five things.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
 Five things are the south, north.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 Sorry, east, south, west, and north.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 This is four.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 So four directions.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 Four directions and a center.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
 It's not in summaries.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 So that is the code of Buddhism.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 This is the whole cosmology.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
 Everything is this.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
 And this inwardly is symbolize our physicals.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 This is what?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
 This center symbolize our head.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
 For this direction, for this lens,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 it's for our limbs.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 To feet, to arms.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
 That includes everything, our bodies.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 Then it is symbolize inward, most inward, in five senses.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 Every senses.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
 So this is symbolize everything.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
 Now we are not that offering.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 Entirely universe, externally, entirely universe.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
 And inwardly, our physical, our body.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
 And more deeper level, our senses, our intelligence.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 And then more deeper level, our awareness of wisdom.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
 Five wisdom.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 All that we are making offerings.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 We are opening that.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
 So this is very brilliant.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 Otherwise, we use also, according to tradition,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 when you practice mandala, such as can be like,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
 mandala, offering mandala in the practice of mandalas.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 And then we use the mandala plate and so forth.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 But today, I guess we will go briefly about that.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
 So with this, this is symbol of that.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
 So everything.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 And also is including all the past life activities.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
 Past lives are our wealth and the belongings

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 that we left behind somewhere that in the past lives.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 And present time, whatever we have, everything.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 Our body, our speech, our wealth.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 And the future of whatever we are going to do,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 anything that in the future lives, all even,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 bring that everything right to the here.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
 And mentally bring that.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 Including all the universes there.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 And with this, then in the teaching,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 also see kind of sun and moon.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 And all that, also visualize everything here.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
 So externally, everything.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 Inwardly everything.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
 Our body, speech, mind.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 And that, feel the strong presence of the

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 (inaudible)

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 And everyone lineage master right in front of that.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
 And then you make that offerings.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
 Kind of really sincerely that you make this offering.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 (inaudible)

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
 He said that the body enjoyment,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
 positions and the glories and the succession

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
 of all of my lives of the past and now.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 And then in all the succession lives of the future,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 everything I offer to the three jewels.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 Order to complete it to accumulation merit.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
 So what's the merit?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
 Accumulation merit.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
 In order to cleanse and purify,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 the two obscurations.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
 Emotion obscuration.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 And knowledge obscuration.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 That I removed completely.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 And with that sincerely thought,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
 and make that kindness.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 Virtualize that, meditate that and kind this prayers.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 This is known as mandala offerings.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
 And what is generally mandala offering?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 Nature of the mandala offering is

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 among the six part of mothers.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 What is this?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 It's generosity practices.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
 Generous, generosity is what?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
 Essence of generosity practice is sharing.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 Sharing, you're sincerely, you're ready to share.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
 Share.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
 You really like to share to others.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 Not going to make the distractions.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 But sincerely sharing attitude is the nature of the generosity.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
 And this time we're sharing everything.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 We are offering that.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 Giving that.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 That to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
 and Gaurabra, and Sambhava.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
 All the enlightened beings should do this.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 That is what mandala offerings are really that.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
 So that is really about the mandala offerings.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 And now we move to the next is

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 is the vajasattva practices.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 Vajasattva practices again as I said before.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 Thank you.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
 As I said before,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 now this mandala offering,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 vajasattva practices,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
 guru yoga practices is all is known as the vajayana practices.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 It is the essence of the vajayana practices.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Now the vajasattva practices has two different steps practices.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
 Practices.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
 We visualize vajasattva above our head.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 We remain ourselves as regular as what we are.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 And then practice vajasattva.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 Also the second step is we visualize ourselves as vajasattva.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
 And then we practice vajasattva.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 There are two different steps.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
 Both steps generally,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
 I guess the practice is very famous to purify our obscurations.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
 And obscuration of ours and obscuration of all the sentient beings.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 That is what the practice of the vajasattva.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
 So it is very powerful purification practices.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 Now practice generally,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
 visualization of vajasattva.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
 What is vajasattva generally?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 First of course,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 basically many of you already know.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Vajasattva is totally enlightened beings.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 Totally Buddha.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 That means it removes all the obscurations

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 and self-importance

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
 and grasping, clinging,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 drawing.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 That removes completely,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 completely clear way

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 and reverts the ordinary nature.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 Love and compassion and wisdom.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
 Completely.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
 That is known as vajasattva.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
 And vajasattva is living Buddhas.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
 It is not the past Buddha.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 It is not the upcoming future Buddha.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 It is living Buddha.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
 Also, vajasattva is known as

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 embodiment of all the Buddhas.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 Embodiment of all the Buddhas.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
 And often said,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
 all Buddhas can be

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 kind of

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
 known as the peaceful wrath of deities, whatever.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
 That all can come.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 Come to the five dhyana Buddhas.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
 And all five dhyana Buddha can be summarized

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 and concluded within one Buddha.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
 And that is the Buddha vajasattva.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 Vajasattva is known as

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 then lord of the sovereign Buddha

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
 of all the enlightened beings.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
 So that is the vajasattva.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 And then vajasattva is so powerful

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 to purify the negativities, obscurations, obstacles.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 And the negativities are then

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 what is negativities?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 Negativity is then we have done

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 many negativities.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
 By our, again, negative emotions.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 It is the same thing.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 By ignorance, by attachment,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 by our anger,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 by our jealous, by our arrogance,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
 we can do mistakes.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
 That even we don't want,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 or we look at that,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
 even we don't want to do,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 but sometimes unknowingly,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 on a way we do mistakes.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 But mistake is a mistake

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
 whether we know or whether we don't know.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 A mistake becomes a mistake.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 It's the same in the teachings said.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 Whether you know or whether you don't know,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
 we eat the poison, it will affect us.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 This is nothing that it has to do.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 But negativity is negatives.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
 And that is now.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
 Who did these negativities?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 It's our mind.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 Mind, a negative has no good quality at all.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 But one good quality is,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 we can cleanse and purify.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 That is a good quality of the negativities.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 So, therefore,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 now, this time,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
 and there's also many different techniques

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
 to purify the negativities.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 In the Hinayana teaching,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Mahayasaka Mahayana teaching

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 and Vajrayana teaching,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 but among all the techniques

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 in the Vajrayasada practice,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
 the most powerful.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
 In the Vajrayana teachings,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
 every negativity can be cleansed

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 and purified by the practicing

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
 of the Vajrayasada practice

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
 because of the Buddha Vajrayasada's

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 previous commitment, his inspiration.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
 In the teachings said,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 by hearing my name and practicing of me,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
 I will not cleanse and purify

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
 the negativities of the sentient beings.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
 I will not become the Buddha

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
 or I will not become the Buddha.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 They made the commitment.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 And it's as he made the commitment,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 if we practice the meditation,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
 it cleanses the purify, the negativities.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 Therefore,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 the Vajrayasada becomes the Buddha.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
 For his commitment.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 So, for that reason,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
 then Vajrayasada is so powerful,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
 so special practices

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
 to cleanse and purify the negativities.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
 And negativities of our past,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 negativities of these lifetimes,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
 negativities maybe will happen in the future.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
 All that negativities,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
 we get together and cleanse and purify that.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
 So, that is really about how we practice

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
 the kind of meaning of the Vajrayasada practice,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
 meaning of the power of the Vajrayasada's.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
 Now, we show how to do

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
 cleanse and purify the negativities.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 Generally, always in the teaching said,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 whenever you know,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
 always we should think poor powers.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 Poor powers, if we do,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
 then really we will purify the negativities.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 First, the power of the object.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
 Second, the power of the,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
 of the recognizing the mistakes and the errors.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
 And third is power of the determination

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 of not repeating.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
 And fourth is power of the using,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 applying the antidotes.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
 Antidotes.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 So, those are the poor powers.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 A poor power ever used,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 no matter how the negativities are big,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 can be removed, can be cleaned,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
 can be completely burned away.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 So, therefore, this is poor powers.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
 First power of the object,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
 there is two powers.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
 Power of the object of the external,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 power of object of the inner, inner powers,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 inner powers.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
 And first power of the object is,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
 I already explained, and you already know,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
 is Buddha Vayasattva.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 Vayasattva,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
 Vayasattva, male and females, with that.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
 That is what we visualize.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 Both Buddha Vayasattva,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
 male and female,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 and this total enlightenment I make already,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
 that is the power of the object by external.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
 Power of the object of the inner world

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 is your devotions,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
 your bodhicata,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
 our determinations

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 that we like to cleanse and provide.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
 That is inner power.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 Now, inner power of the object,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
 the outer power of the object,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
 combined together, strongly that.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 Then we visualize.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
 That is become known as power of object.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
 Now, to visualize the Buddha Vayasattva,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 we are going to visualize Buddha Vayasattva

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 right above our head

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 and facing same directions.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 Same direction where we are facing, our south.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
 Buddha Vayasattva is one face, two arms, two legs,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
 sitting with various postures,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
 on the lotus and moon desks.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 And Vayasattva is a union with the consult,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
 known as yima.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 Also, one face, two arms, two legs,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
 and a union with that.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000
 And that is known as power of the object of the extent.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
 And now, when you visualize the Buddha Vayasattva,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 it is also transcendental western rainbow body.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
 Transcendental western rainbow body is body,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
 is transcendental western rainbow body

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
 as a reflection moon in the water,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
 not substantial solid existence.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
 And his voice, or his or her voice,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
 is also a melodious voice

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 of the soothing and calming in the teachings.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 It's calm and soothing,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
 and sound of blessings, sound of the happy, peace.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 That is his voice, her voice.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 His wisdom mind, mind is wisdom.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
 Compassion, love, and kindness,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
 and then love and kindness.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
 That is, nothing, that is.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
 So outside, inside, he speaks,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 and all the absolute transcendental western rainbow bodies.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
 Then there is, of course,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 explaining of all the major and manual marks

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
 and the seven qualities of the peaceful Buddhas,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 and as well as all that.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 But generally, so really,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 I won't go all those numbers right now,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 but all that is known as transcendental western rainbow body.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 Advaita Sattva's embodiment of all Buddhas,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 as I said, his embodiment of all Buddhas

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
 of the past, prison, and the future,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 every Buddha, every enlightened begins

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
 to want to get one single state of this Buddha.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
 That is the Buddha Vaidya Sattva's.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
 Buddha Vaidya Sattva,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 that means love and compassion,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
 wisdom of all the Buddhas come together,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
 one single state.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
 A total union with concert, great blessfulness,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
 and transcendental transparent,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
 listen to the status.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 Status.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 That is the way we are going to visualize.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
 And merely think of the Vaidya Sattva

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
 and it removes all our suffering,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 the difficulty, troubles, and obscurations.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
 And at the same time, as you visualize,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
 you have stone devotions,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 devotions, stone devotions.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
 And also we practice this not just only for us,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 but we practice it for all the sentient beings,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 all the sentient beings, to remove the suffering,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
 the difficulty, troubles, every living beings.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 And sincerely feel the closeness,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
 feeling Vaidya Sattva, with the devotions,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 without doubt and hesitation.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
 That is the inner power of the object.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
 So you visualize this.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 So that is kind of really about the power of the object.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
 Second power of the recognize our error, mistakes.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 This is generally mistake's mistake.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 When we see something mistake that we made in our lives,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 since we had memories by our negativities,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
 such as ignorance, attachment, and all that,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 we see that clearly remember something,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
 bring up that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 Recognize error is error.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
 Mistakes, mistakes, acknowledge it.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 We're not going to hide that with our ego clingings

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
 and arrogance or kind of hiding.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 We're going to really see, oh, I did mistakes.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
 Now I'm going to cleanse it, purify that.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
 And that is right, bring that right in front of us,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 toggen with that.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
 All the mistakes what we had the past, mistakes in the future,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 and not just causal mistakes, the ignorance, attachment,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 anger, and jealousy.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
 That also, whether we're actively doing something with that

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 or not, this is a mistake.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
 That is mistake is mistakes of the ego cling,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 mistakes of the dualities and habit,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 but I'm going to cleanse and purify that.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 Include duality, include ego cling itself,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 I'm going to cleanse and purify.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 Kind of strongly think that, that.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 So recognize that in a way, targeting that.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 You're targeting to cleanse and purify that.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 Third power is power of the not repeated that again.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
 And particularly this time, that activity, that hurt myself,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 hurt my friend, family member,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 or anyone wants that going to hurt or did hurt.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 That is not good.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 I'm not going to repeat that again.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 Kind of, by the blessings of all the linear masters,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
 may I never repeat that unhealthy,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
 unwholesome habit-dependent activities.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
 Again, that kind of have very determination,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
 convection area, potent in your heart and mind,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
 or our heart and mind.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
 Strongly that, really that.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 May I'm not going to repeat that.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 May it never happen that again.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
 Again, I'm going to stay very wholesome, clean,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
 puri, puri, puri status that make benefit to beings that, that.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 So that is called the power of the, of the not repeating

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 or uprooting, that will uproot, uproot the negativity

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
 and the power of not repeating that.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
 Poor this, because of that.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
 Now you're going to, as you recognize the target,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 you're kind of connected,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
 recognize the target of the errors and mistakes.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 And then now we're going to use antidotes.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
 Antidotes, strongly.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 And antidote is, again, best upon the bodhicitta,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 best upon the devotions,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
 and the best upon, upon the meditation.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 And then now we're going to recite the mantras.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 Mantra.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 So we visualize, we just start right above as head.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
 And then, all that.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
 And now you're going to recite the mantra.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 100 syllable mantras is here, making one, that 100 syllable mantra.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
 Here is it.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
 As you recite in heart center of the vajasattva,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
 there is a moon desk, moon desk, vajasattva.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 As you recite in the mantra, in the human mantra, heart center,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 that moon desk, there is a center of the moon desk.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
 In heart center, there is a home syllable.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
 Home syllable, white home syllable.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 That home syllable is circled by with these 100 syllables.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 When you recite in the mantra,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 that also starts shimmering and reciting.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
 And from that, a lot of natural standard is centered.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
 From the heart center of the vajasattva,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 it came down through the union status, through the union.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 And then it came to our kronchakra,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 and then entered our body and cleansed all our negativities.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
 Negativities, cleansing, that.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 And really feel that is removed.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 And that also, that light is going to all the living with that.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
 Cleansing, purifying, their obscenities, negativities.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
 And then, but more focusing to yourself,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
 and cleansing, purifying, removing that.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 Everything negativities are going away.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
 All that, recited this mantra every year of time.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 Seven times, 21 times at the beginning of times.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
 21 times at the beginning of times.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 After that, vajasattva dissolved.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
 Vajasattva both male and female dissolved into light.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
 And that light came down to your heart center.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 That moment, you become the vajasattvas.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 Yours will now become the vajasattva.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 Exactly the same, call it as we visualized.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 As we visualized.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 And then recited these short mantras.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
 Short mantras.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 That's maybe one mala.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 This is a short mantra, one mala.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
 After that, then that old visualization is dissolved,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
 dissolved in your heart center.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
 And heart center, nature of the mind.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 And nature of the mind is when beyond of any reference points.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 And relax, meditate, and that nature states.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 As long as you have time, I will say about maybe five minutes.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 Five minutes.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
 Five minutes or whatever that.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:45.000
 So that is really about the vajasattva practices.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 And now, maybe you have some questions.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
 Maybe a short time.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
 And then I will go to the guruvihoga.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
 Or I just do continuity now.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 Maybe do okay, continue.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
 Okay, so the vajasattva practices.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 So now, this will be completed what?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:15.000
 Rafuj, bodhicitta, mandala offering or rafuj with pore station.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 Bodhicitta, mandala offering and vajasattva.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
 That will be complete very simple or the essence meaning this.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
 Now, the fifth one or the sixth one is then practicing of the guruvihoga.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
 That what is called here.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
 Swampli penitering blessings of the gurus.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
 This is now blessings.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
 So is Swampli receiving the blessings.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
 What is the blessings?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 Blessings is unceasing energy of loving kindness,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 compassion, wisdom that started from the Buddha Shakyamuni

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
 or the Buddha samadabhadra to vajadhara

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
 and then Buddha Shakyamuni.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 Then continue to guruvihoga, sambhava, ichimsoji

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 and continue until now from the master to master

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
 or the disciple to disciple continually unceasing lineage.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 That is now really here we are receiving.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
 When we receive that blessings and streams of that, what is what does?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 It will activating our realization.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
 Our nature beautifully and glorify that beautiful nature.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 And so that is the Buddha, the blessings.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 And that is to come this is then is known as practicing of the gurus,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 practice of the guruviyogas.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
 Now, what is generally gurus?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 Guru is then has again there is two meanings.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
 A kind of simple way to tell, the outer guru and inner gurus.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
 Outer guru is such as we are visualizing gurupayama sambhava

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
 as embodiment of the old teachers, masters, lineage masters,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
 all the Buddha dharma sangha, all guru deva dakinis,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
 all that what we visualize.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
 That is the outer gurus.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:29.000
 Inner guru is our your devotions and your bodhicatas

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 and your devotion the free from or confidence, confidence.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
 The devotion, confidence and bodhicata is inner gurus.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:49.000
 Together with that as said this morning, what is mindfulness, alertness,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
 all consciousness, those are the inner gurus.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
 Outer guru and inner gurus are combined target.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 That is the practices of the gurus, that now practices.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 To do this visualization or two practices, there is a different systems, substance.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
 Sometimes you can maintain as yourself as what we are

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 and then visualize the gurupayama sambhava or the lid right in front of us

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
 or above our heads.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
 And sometimes you can visualize the inika ditis or buddhas,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
 your side and visualize the gurupayama sambhava right in front of our skies

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 or the lineage masters.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
 In this case here said veggie yoginis.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
 So now we are going to visualize ourself as veggie yoginis

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
 or to practice like this.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
 And this is again why we do the veggie yoginis.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
 Generally in the teaching said, veggie yogini is what?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
 Known as mother of the old buddhas.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
 Now we like to give birth of ourself as buddha.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 We like to become birth of the buddha in our heart and mind.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
 Therefore we connect to the mothers.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:09.000
 Mother, a mother is known as, veggie yogini is mother of all the buddhas.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 Other pandya paramata is known as mother of all the buddhas.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
 And so this case veggie yogini is pandya paramata is tara yishinshoja.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 That is what we are going to visualize as I said

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
 to give the birth of the buddhahood to ourself now to do that.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
 And that is the what?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
 And the veggie also veggie yogini or the what is mother of the old buddha

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
 means what?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Generally is also known as the wisdom.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
 Wisdom is open wisdom.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
 Open wisdom is free from any attachment, free from any grasping.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 That is the wisdom.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
 When we have that wisdom then we are ready to give the birth of the buddhas.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
 And this is the nature of our mind.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
 The nature of our mind is free from duality, free from grasping,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
 even though we didn't recognize yet immediately that.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 But that is really our nature.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
 That is the Dzogin state.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
 Dzogin state is mother of all the buddhas.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000
 So this time we visualize veggie yogini or inseparably yishinshoja.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
 Dzogya is ourself.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
 And veggie yogini is then one face, two arms, two legs.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
 Right?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
 Sitting on the lotus.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 Not sitting, sorry.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 Standing, walking postures.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
 Walking postures, standing on the lotus with walking postures.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
 And one face, two arms, two legs.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 And with radish colors.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
 Radish colors.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000
 And then she hold, hold in the dhammaru and skull cups.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
 Or some teaching said also tridentity.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
 But anyway.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
 And so that is our veggie.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
 Our veggie yogini is also transcendent of the wisdom of our body.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 Totally glowing, wisdom enlightened state in a very radical state.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
 That's glowing state.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
 That is what we visualize.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
 Right in front of the sky we visualize gurupyama sambhavas.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
 Who is?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 As in the teaching said, our root teacher manifested palm dapyama sambhavas.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.000
 So our teacher, all our lineage master, everything is done.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
 Come in one single state as I said this morning.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 Many times it's gurupyama sambhavas.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 Gurupyama sambhavas.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
 That's what we see.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
 Gurupyama sambhavas is one face, two arms as you all know.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
 Mostly you all know.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
 And again transcendent of the wisdom of our body.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
 Body, embodiment of all the buddhas, everyone that's what we see.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
 That we visualize.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 And gurupyama sambhavas is looking to us.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
 I will love and compare your wisdom.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
 And we let it smile.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
 Radiating light of love and compare your wisdom to us.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
 To all the beings.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
 To feel strong devotions.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
 To write strong devotions.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
 And also strong kind of confidence and joy.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
 Today I'm going to reveal the perfect nature of my own self.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 And to order to benefit to all living beings.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
 Really thinking that strongly sincerely wishing.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 Beautiful wishing that.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
 And then we realize gurupyama sambhavas.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
 With that thought and then join these following prayers here.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
 Said that embodiment of all the buddhas of three times without exceptions.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
 Mostly excellent root teacher.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
 I pray to you.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 And then here in these future lives and pardo in these three times hold me your compassion.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
 Bless this is literally throughout the three times.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 Times, join that three times.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
 Times.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 You can join this in it a bit.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
 You can join this in it.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 But trying to catch the meaning.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
 Sensitively.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 This is devotion call.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 This is devotion prayers.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
 And this is what we like to be.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
 What we like to be.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
 What we like to be now.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
 What we like to be in the pardo.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 What we like to be in the future.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
 And not just only what we.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
 We like that prayer to all the sentient beings.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
 May everyone become in that way.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000
 That way in the product I showed every part to the enlightenment states.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 Really we sincerely.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
 We can bring that.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
 Join this.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 This.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
 As you join this prayers.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
 From the Murappan Masambha.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
 Also emanating so many lights to you.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
 To you.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 To you.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 So reverently as to that nature.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
 You already were a Yogini state.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 You already in the way.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
 Yichinswaja status.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
 Now reverently.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
 Continually that nature.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
 Exactly what Yichinswaja reverent.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
 What the way the Yogini is.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
 That is what we really see this.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
 Sensarily that.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
 Kind of feel a strong bond between.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
 Between Murappan Masambha and yourself.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
 With the affection.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 With the loving kindness.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 With the devotion.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
 And with the great blessfulness.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
 Very uplifting.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
 And not just only this.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
 You and Murappan Masambha.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
 But entirely universe is thus formed.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
 In the pure land of Murappan Masambha.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
 Copper glory mountains.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
 Every inhabitant beings.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
 Are also in the way.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
 With their dharas.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
 Male and females.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 Or Yogi in a Yogini.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
 Everyone seen that.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
 End of it that strong devotion.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
 And strong confidence.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
 And then.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
 Reciting the Mantra of Murappan Masambha.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000
 As you reciting the Mantra of Murappan Masambha.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
 Krum Murappan Masambha.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 Emanating.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
 Slatter light.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
 From his forehead.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
 From his speech center.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
 From his heart center.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 Such as a white arm.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 Red arm.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
 Blue arm.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
 And multiple light from every pulse of his body.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
 And coming to you.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 Showers that.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
 As rain dawn.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 And cleansing and purifying.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
 Activating our own Buddha natures.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
 In the absolute, utterly beautiful state.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 Enlightened status.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
 And whole universe is now transformed.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
 In that great blessfulness of mandalas.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
 As it is.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
 Which then reciting this Mantra.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 Onvahong.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
 Virgin Gurappan Masadyam.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
 As many as you can.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
 Or one Mala.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
 Two Mala.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
 Or three Malas.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
 Or maybe at the beginning of 21 times.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
 Whatever you can do.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 But strong devotion.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
 Without a doubt and hesitation.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
 This time also devotion means.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
 No doubt.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
 No hesitation.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
 No kind of any intellectual area.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
 This and that.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 Without interference that.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
 Our thought.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
 With all the thought.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
 Rest our mind.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
 One single state of devotion.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 And concentration.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
 Very relaxed calm.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
 Peaceful atmosphere.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
 Relax that nature status.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
 States.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
 And continue reciting the mantras.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
 That is known as practicing of the Guru Yavas.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
 We practice it this way.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 Every blessing, the realization will come so fast.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
 And so quickly.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 So quickly.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
 So immediately.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
 And this devotion generally.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
 When we have the devotions.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
 Then everything comes.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
 So beautiful.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 And the Buddha's teaching said.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
 When you don't have the doubt and hesitation.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
 Everything is fulfilled as you wish.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 Doubt and hesitation are the interference.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
 And of course.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
 At the beginning time when you are studying.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
 When you are contemplating or studying time.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
 We can have question and answer and doubt and hesitation.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
 So these things we can do that.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
 But when you come to the practice time.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
 Really it should be embarrassed that really.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
 Really devotion.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
 That means no doubt.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
 No hesitation.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
 Stay with the one point in the mind.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
 With that.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
 With that is.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
 Then in the Gaurabhema Samba teaching what is it.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 And you have the devotion.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
 Devotion.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
 I was right with you.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
 Or I'm with you.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
 Right that time.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
 With the devotion.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
 Gaurabhema Samba is right with us.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
 And with the devotion.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
 Also all the Buddha's bodhisattvas are right with us.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
 That.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
 And the Buddha's in Gaurabhema Samba.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
 And any enlightenment.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
 Has no distance between time and space.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
 As soon as we have opened the door of our devotion.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
 The Buddha's right in front of us.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
 Right with us.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
 That.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
 So.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
 And for that reason.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
 This is devotion practices.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
 And that is what we should really stone.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 And then when the devotion comes.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
 And then there is always realization.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
 Don't.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
 This is for example.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
 Witnessed by all the great masters.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 When you read.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
 For example.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
 The life story of the great master.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
 How his devotion is strong.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
 And long shimbas.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
 And devotion.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
 So all realization comes with the devotions.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
 Realization comes.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
 And then.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
 For example.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
 Great master.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
 Malarepa's.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
 His devotion.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
 His unfailing.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
 That devotion.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
 That he get enlightenment.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
 Within his lifetime.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
 So that is long shimba.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
 Everyone is this.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
 There is a very famous master.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
 Of the like.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
 Again.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
 I think it is one of the great master of the Khaji schools.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
 He said.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
 If you don't have the devotions.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
 There is no sunlight of the blessing will come.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
 To you.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
 If there is no sunlight of the blessings.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
 That.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
 Then.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
 There is no realization will draw that.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
 So the sun.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
 The devotion is warm.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
 Devotion is light.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
 Devotion is.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
 Then.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
 Siddling growth.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
 Signs of the realization.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
 Without that.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
 It is not going to happen that.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
 So devotion also means.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 We settle to the practice now.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
 We are not going to lingering.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
 We are just hovering that.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
 We really settled our soul.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
 So this is what the devotions.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
 After you practice this.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
 As many as time as I said one mala.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
 After that.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 Then you receive the final blessings.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
 Those are known as the blessings of the body.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
 Speech.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
 Mind.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
 That you received.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
 And that is then.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
 From the forehead.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
 From the forehead of the M.Sambhava.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 Receive.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
 Right.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
 Light.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
 Came.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
 To your right.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
 Your forehead.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
 It cleans all the body obscurations.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
 Receive the body blessings.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
 And then.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
 Begin to actualize with the namakaya states.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
 From the speech center.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
 Red.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
 R.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
 From the M.Sambhava.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
 M and R.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
 Red.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
 Light.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
 Enter your speech center.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
 And that cleans.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
 You receive the speech blessings from the M.Sambhava.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
 And cleansing all our speech obscurations.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
 You will begin to actualize with the sambhaka states.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
 From the heart center of the M.Sambhava.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
 Ammonating.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
 Ammonating.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
 Blue light.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
 And that we received.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
 What's the mind blessing with the M.Sambhava.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
 And cleansing the obscurations.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
 Our mind obscuration.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
 That cleans the purify.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
 We begin to actualize with the.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
 Darmakaya states.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
 And then from the three places of the M.Sambhava.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
 Poor head.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
 Speech.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
 Heart center.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
 Three light come.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
 All from the heart center.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
 Multiple light came once more again.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
 Enter your three places of the heart center.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
 And that you receive the entire blessings of the body, speech, mind, M.Sambhava.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
 Cleans the habit obscurations of all our obscurations.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 We begin to actualize the ultimate state of the Buddhist states.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
 Completely.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
 All the sambhavakaya states.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
 That you received.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
 And finally in the M.Sambhava.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
 Excited and joyful.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
 Your devotion is in the M.Sambhava.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
 Kind of overwhelmed that.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
 And that moment M.Sambhava dissolved.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
 And multiple lights become small.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
 Spare of light dissolved in the M.Sambhava.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
 Multiple spares of light that come to you.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
 Instant to your heart center.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
 And then your M.Sambhava.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
 And your mind.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 And M.Sambhava.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000
 M.Sambhava without any separation and difference.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
 And you become one with M.Sambhava.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
 Merging your mind with mind of the lineage masters of M.Sambhava.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
 And then meditating on that nature status.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
 As long as you time.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
 And relax.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
 Not thinking in the past.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
 Not thinking in the future.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
 Not also wondering thought in any directions.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
 Relax and fresh moment present status.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
 As it is.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
 In that origin status.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
 As long as you can.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
 Or as long as you have time.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
 During that time your mind won't stay exactly that way.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
 And the moment you see mind is going away.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
 Don't follow the thought.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
 Don't analyze.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
 Again do the same.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
 Relax on the nature status.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
 Without any division of the past, present and future.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
 Relax.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
 Just relax the present status.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
 That is known as freshness state of the ordinal, ordinary Dharmakaya status.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
 And the Dzokhi state.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
 That is what the practice is.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
 Meditate.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
 And then also to do these things here.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
 Like I said here.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
 I mentioned already this.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
 That is this meditation guru, kaya, vaka, kasna, chai, and those.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
 And the final teacher dissolved.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
 And then he has said behold the emptiness awareness.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
 The true face of lama.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
 Emptiness awareness is what that emptiness awareness is.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
 This is our own nature of the mind.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
 Or our mind.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
 When you look to your mind.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
 To your mind by your mind.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
 Or by your mind to your mind.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
 What do you see?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
 There is nothing to see.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
 That is known as emptiness awareness.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
 That is the ordinary nature.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
 That is the ordinary nature where everything started.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
 This is the nature.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
 Just relax on that natural status.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
 Status.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
 That is many times also known as prison status.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
 It is the right prison.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
 It is fresh.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
 It is not delivered by any consumption.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
 Relax on that natural status.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
 This is known as zokchin status.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
 This is also known as mahamudra status.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
 This is known as pandyaparamudra status.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
 This is also known as mademaka status.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
 Relax on that.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
 That is then the absolute guru.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
 Absolute Buddha.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
 Your inner nature, my inner nature.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
 Relax on that.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
 And so that.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000
 So that is really about the guru yoga practice.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
 Now next one is then here.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
 The additional practice is here.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
 The pud here.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
 This is the poor practices.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
 I pray to the product of amidabad Buddha of limited light.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000
 Grant me the blessings become a conflict in the profound part of the poor.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
 This is the poor practice.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
 This is transferring the consciousness.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
 This is generally the additional instructions.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
 How we take care of ourselves.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
 Moment of the time of believing this is our body.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
 Physical status.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
 Sooner or later, we believe this is our physical body.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
 We are not going to stay with this forever.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
 Therefore, how are we going to take care of ourselves?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
 Most of the time, we leave our body without any goal.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
 Without any preparations.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
 Without any destinations.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
 But this time, by the Buddha, by the Gaurabhama Sambhava,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
 through their kindness instructing us how we should be prepared,

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
 how we should be ready to leave this world.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.000
 World with style, with destination, with goal.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
 That's really what it is.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
 Poor practices.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
 Poor practice.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
 We live with confidence.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
 We live with the goals.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
 We will live with visions.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
 Visions.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
 That's what I'm saying.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
 We will live with style.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
 That's it.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
 So for that is known as poor practices.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
 Really, this practice is a preparation for that.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
 And this is what.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
 Our consciousness, there are always three intentions.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
 Three intentions we should have.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
 This is what I'm talking about.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
 Three intentions.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
 The intention of the destination,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
 intention of who is going to leave,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
 intention of the passage.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
 There are three ways.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
 A board, a board, a goal, or the destination,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
 traveler, and the passage.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
 Three things.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
 The destination is then here.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
 Buddha Amitabha.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
 The pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
 Again, among all the Buddhas in the Buddha Amitabha said,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
 this is his aspirations.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
 It's easy to take birth, easy to go to that places,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
 to any, than any other pure lands, Buddha lands.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
 So therefore, here is Buddha Amitabha.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
 So destination is Buddha Amitabha.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
 And pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
 Who is going to leave?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
 Is our consciousness.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
 Actually, who will take rebirth?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
 A court of Buddhism believes rebirth.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
 Who is going to take rebirth?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
 Not by body.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
 Body will leave behind.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
 Rebirth will take by consciousness.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
 Our mind, that means your mind, my mind will travel.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
 That is what is going to travel.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.000
 And so, this time, mind is travelers.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
 How is going to travel?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
 Travel, the passage.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
 Passage is the channels.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
 This time, our channels.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
 Body has so many channels.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
 And again, I'm not going to all those things.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
 But this time, we're going to see, pick up one channel.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
 That's called central channels.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
 Central channel is passage.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
 That's it.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
 We're going to, this, usually, generally in the teaching said,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
 when we leave the body, we can, our consciousness can leave any places.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
 Any place, any part of the body, we can leave.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.000
 But this time, we are making sure our consciousness will leave

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000
 through the central channel, and through the upper kronchakras, holes.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
 There is many holes, or many kinds of passages.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
 Of course, every pole of the body has holes.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
 Generally, according to the teaching.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
 But there is principal holes.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
 Among the principal holes, there is one hole known as center,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
 hole of the center channels on our kronchakra.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
 So we are going to use the center channel as our passage,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000
 and that the kronchakra hole will be used, our final exit doors.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000
 Exit door to go to the destination of the pure land of the Buddha Amitabhas.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
 That is what we're going to relax.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000
 So, for that, again, this is just simple in our text.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
 And we visualize the Buddha Amitabha right above our head.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
 Again, same way as the Buddha Veda Sathama.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
 And once above our head, we visualize the Buddha Amitabha.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
 Buddha Amitabha is the same, Buddha as embodiment,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000
 or Buddha as transcendental, transcendental, as I mentioned earlier.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
 We can call it embodiment that. And Buddha Amitabha is so calm,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
 so fierce for total enlightenment, totally low in kindness,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
 compared to us, to all the living beings.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
 Strongly that, visualize that, in glowing daily light.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.000
 And then we're going to visualize our consciousness in the heart centers.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
 According generally in the Veda and the teaching,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000
 our consciousness, principal residence, residing place, is heart center, heart center.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
 So here, we visualize heart and consciousness.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
 And then we can't really visualize this center channel.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
 It's totally open, clear, as the hollow tubes.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
 A hollow, glowing hollow tube.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
 And we're going to see this moving up and up, up in the center channel,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
 and then went to the heart center of the Buddha Amitabha.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
 Can't we just make that preparation?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
 Of course, there's more instructing some poor practices,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
 but that's just kind of like that connection, that indication.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
 When the time comes, I'm going to do that.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
 I'm going to visualize and kind of see clearly my center channel

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
 and my consciousness, and that indicator,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
 and then going to leave through the passage of that,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
 and the final exit door exit, I will use,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
 ejected of my consciousness to the heart center of the Buddha Amitabha.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
 Kind of thinking of that, and then join these prayers three times.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.000
 So here, see the reciting, as many times possible, motivated to transfer.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
 That's basically just this very simple practice of the board there.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
 And once we've finished that, and then final one here,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000
 said, and now this chariot of the body and the dedication of the virtues.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
 Now, final one is then page 42.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
 And this is now this first two lines.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
 Here's two things.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
 Now my body, possessions, and source of my virtues,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:18.000
 all together I give without cling to all the beings who have been my parents.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
 So that is chariot of the bodies.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
 And then may I accomplish great benefit unobstructed,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000
 obstructively for the beings. That is dedications of the virtues.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
 Virtues benefit to all the sentient beings.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
 So this is the two kind of practices or the two things.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
 And the first is chariot of the body is very really kind of condense

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
 at the instructions of the two practices.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
 I think many of you heard two practices.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
 It is one of the great teachings of the Buddhas.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
 And one of the great practices of the Tibet Buddhism is known as two practices.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
 This is started with the, of course, time in the Gharapama Sambhava,

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:12.000
 and then as well as there is like four great lineage of the two camps to Tibet

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
 by Gharapama Sambhava, and by great master Marva Marva,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:24.000
 and by great master then Patamba Sanyi, and then one great master, lady master,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000
 Machig Labdha Dhamma. So there is four great lineage camps.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
 Perto the Tibet, Tibet in all that.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
 And particularly, though that you started, particularly among all of that,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
 then this last one, the great wisdom Dakini, Machig Labdhu,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
 must become the leading master of the two practices

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
 who came around the 11th century.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
 He is the emanation of the Yishimsoja and the emanation of the Tara,

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
 and that was, he was born in Tibet.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
 And he is very famous.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
 Two practices, two means, it's a very word, what that means?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
 Cutting ego cling, cutting the attachment, that is what.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
 And mostly what we attach it and is to our body,

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.000
 and therefore immediately go to the heart and root to cut the clinging to the body.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
 That is what this great master sought.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
 These teachings, of course, are also teaching of the Buddhas.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni gave these teachings, in the Mahayana teachings,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.000
 Pandya Parama teachings, and as well as then, in the Mahayana teachings.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
 So the great master, particularly Machig Labdhu,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
 kind of combined sutra, essence of the Mahayana sutra teaching

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
 and the Vedayana teaching, joined together and made as dual practices.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
 It's become so powerful in Tibet.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
 And then, later on, this dual lineage practice of the Machig Labdhu,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
 kind of merged with all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
 To the Nyingma, to the Gaju, to the Sajja, to the Gelo,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
 everywhere really began to practice this and that.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
 So it's kind of merged to everyone.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
 But this practice has become so powerful.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
 And this is also, by these practices,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
 what I mean, again, in the Buddha's teaching,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.000
 in the Sesa in Gatha, very famous teaching,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
 Buddha taught Pandya Parama teaching, known as Sesa in Gatha,

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
 which has 300 standard teachings.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
 And there, Buddha said, in that teaching,

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
 by the poor powers,

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:44.000
 then, at bodhisattva, with very skillfully courageous,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
 will overcome the poor demons.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
 Come the poor demons, those poor powers

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
 are understanding the perfect meaning of the emptiness

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
 and understanding, or keeping the perfect meaning of the bodhic kathas,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
 and maintaining perfect moralities.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000
 And then, as well as perfect and lineage teachings.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
 Maintain, those are the four powers.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
 If you maintain that, that again,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
 if I summarize this, and then understand the emptiness

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
 with the bodhic katha, with good conduct,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
 and with the lineage practices,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
 then you will overcome poor demons.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
 Poor demons has many different, again, in the teachings

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
 that many of you already heard.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
 Those are known as the first, the query,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
 general poor demons in the Buddha teaching mentioned,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:46.000
 this demon of the aggregates, demon of the emotions,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
 demon of the death, demon of the distractions.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
 Those are the four demons, this.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
 And particularly in the Mati Laibron's teaching,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
 there is four demons.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
 This is the same thing, but she named slight different ways.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
 Or it's not just here, but again in the Buddha teaching too.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000
 Those are known as tangible demons, untangible demons,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000
 and demon of the excitements,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:26.000
 and demon of attachment, demon of the attachments.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000
 So tangible, tangible demon, untangible demon,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
 and excitement demon, and attachment demons.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
 Those are the four demons that in the two practices.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
 And this is, again, we have the realization

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
 and maintain a perfectly meaning of the great emptiness

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
 and bodhic katha, good conduct,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
 and keeping the lineage teaching exactly as it,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
 overcome these four demons, poor demons.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
 And at the same time, we can cleanse and purify those four demons.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
 Whether in the general Buddha teaching, teaching,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
 teaching as a demon of the aggregate,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000
 demon of the emotions, demon of the death,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
 demon of the distractions, or demon of that generally.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
 And specifically, again in the two practices,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
 demon of the tangible, untangible,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
 and excitement, and attachment, or the ego-cling.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
 That will be removed by this.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
 So with this understanding,

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
 then you can give everything to every living beings.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
 Your body, your speech, and your physical, or physical,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
 and even your mind, love and compassion,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
 without any restructure to all the sentient beings,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
 and also without any holding back, endless.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
 Here I said, I give without clinging to all the beings.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000
 Also endless, it's not just going to end there just one time.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
 You multiply it according to meditation.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.000
 Practice endless and total satisfaction to every living beings.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000
 Not just something that you give and end it.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
 You give continually unending generosity practices

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:18.000
 with your meditation and satisfy everyone with perfect status.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
 Perfect status.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
 So bear in to say that.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
 So that is about giving without clinging.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
 And that is again chariot of the body,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
 which means condense meaning of the two practices,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
 and then delicately merit.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
 May I complicate, may I complicate the great benefit,

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
 unobstructed for all beings, is delicately merit.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
 Again, we start this practice with both each other,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
 kindness, compassion, thinking of all living beings.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
 We're going to concatenate this entire practice with, again,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
 with love and kindness, compassion to every living beings.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
 Whatever I gain from this, my practice, meditation,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000
 seeing this, that energy, whatever, may I share that all living beings

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
 to remove their suffering, the difficult troubles,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000
 to ever last of their love, jobiness, joy, and peace.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.000
 Peace may eventually everyone reach enlightenment by my practices.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
 Really wishing sincerely from death of our heart

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
 and dedicating that merit.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
 So that is really instructions of this two practices

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
 and the dedication practices.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
 And now we kind of completed everything and very briefly.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000
 And so if you like some questions, I'm happy to discuss,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
 but it's five o'clock already, so.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:45.000
 Okay, thank you. Sorry, sir.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
 Any questions?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:58.000
 I don't have time in the morning to do all of this at once.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
 Can I break it, like do it roughly in the morning

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
 and do the rest when I come back from work?

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
 I cannot do that.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
 What you can do.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
 Definitely, you can do anything with what suits your video schedule.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
 But however, as I said this morning,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
 morning or this whenever that,

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
 you always do practices, for example, when you practice.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
 Get out in the morning, or sit on your cushion,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
 and now you're going to bring more joy and more appreciations.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
 And the appreciations of your life,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
 your situation, circumstances, really how lucky,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
 how beautiful, how precious it is to think of that.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.000
 And then you can also reflect everything is in permanent and thinking of that.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
 And that three thoughts, among the four train of the mind,

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
 at least if you can bring that two thoughts, that very strongly that.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
 And then coordinates, everything is connected.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
 Everything is kind of really, really very connected.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
 All this, so what may I become?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
 Very thoughtful of every one of my actions.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
 And then I'm doing this made benefit for all the same things.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
 Kind of that thought, just for one minute or so,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
 one and a half minute, you can think of that four thoughts.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.000
 And that, and then with that, and you feel stop presence of the Gharapamma,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
 some of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas right in front of the sky,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
 and the Chakraful, and they develop the Bodhisattvas.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
 And then, if you have, I mean, if that will, for example,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
 that chanting that three times, three times, it won't take long times.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.000
 But if you, then, if still you have some times,

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
 and then you start, if you have time to do all these things,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
 for example, like three times, three times,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
 and the Jaya in the major sattva mantra, maybe seven times,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
 a long time, one seven times, and a short one, maybe 21 times,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
 or one mala, whatever, and after that, then you go to the Guru Yoga,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
 and again, do those three times, practice visualize,

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
 and then Jaya in the mantra, maybe 21 times, or one mala,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000
 and then receive the blessings, meditate, meditate,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
 and then one, maybe two, three minutes, five minutes.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.000
 So, but if you have time, for example, 15 minutes, or half an hour,

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
 then it can fit everything, everything there.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000
 If that is like too many things to do that, then I will say,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
 again, do start with this four bones, four,

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
 that reverse in the mind practices, rafu and bodhicata,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
 and then go to the Guru Yoga.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000
 And practice seven lines, if you don't have time to do all of those,

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000
 prepare, join the seven line prayer three times,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
 and with meditation, reciting mantra 21 times, one mala,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
 and then receive that blessings, all that, and then meditate

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
 for five minutes, and dedicate the merits.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
 Merit, and that also kind of thing, you're not doing all those things,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
 so many things, one after another, just really meditate

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
 and assemble for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
 - Great. - Great.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
 - Kurt had a question back. - Oh, and the Bush is over here.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
 - Yes, yes, yes, yeah. - You can pull the Bush out.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
 So, in our Indoor practice, we're focused on Guru Yoga,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
 and we've completed that, we've done our 100,000 mantras.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
 How do we know which practice to move on to next?

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
 Actually, this is generally, next is,

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
 then after the Guru Yoga practices, have you completed the Guru Yoga practices

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
 according to the reputation of a number, according to the lineage as a token?

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
 Then you really move to the, then rafuja and bhastakha togas.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
 Move to the rafuja and bhastakha.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
 When you finish that rafuja and bhastakha,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
 then you move to the, maybe, to the, both each other,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
 or you can move to the register of practice.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
 I mean, you can choose which you like, or we can discuss that,

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
 but that's what we should do.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
 Then first, after you finish the Guru Yoga practices,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
 then go to the rafuja and bhastakha.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
 And even if you're doing rafuja and bhastakha,

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000
 you do both each other practices three times,

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
 and others also, maybe, three times,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
 and seven times a month, I'm going to register the mantra,

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000
 and then focus to the rafuja and bhastakha.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
 - Thank you. - Okay.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
 What else?

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
 Okay. Then we do short meditation,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
 and then I'm going to give,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
 I'm going to give the transmission of these practices.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
 These practices, and that is, again,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
 of course, maybe there is a few purposes.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
 Some purposes are on the, this was caught.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
 - Streaming. - Streaming, streaming this.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
 According to the, I think, generally transmission,

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
 we don't, can do through the streaming, streaming.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
 But also definitely the blessings.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
 So I will give this, generally transmission is an involvement.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
 Those are always direct connection, contact,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
 according to most of the teachings.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
 Of course, some great high alums here,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
 high grade teachers, maybe, can do those things.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
 But however, then the regular way is the transmission,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
 the transmission, empowerment, all that really comes in.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000
 They kind of contact each other and then receive the transmissions.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000
 But however, I will do today, and we can count as blessings,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
 those who are kind of in the far distances,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
 and otherwise I will give these transmissions to him, okay?

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
 And we all meditate.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
 We all meditate, and then I will give this transmission.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
 I will just read this.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
 (Tibetan)

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
 (Tibetan)

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
 (Tibetan)

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
 (Tibetan)

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
 (Tibetan)

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
 (Tibetan)

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
 (Tibetan)

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
 (Tibetan)

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.000
 (Tibetan)

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:34.000
 (Tibetan)

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
 (Tibetan)

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
 (Tibetan)

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:30.000
 (Tibetan)

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
 (Tibetan)

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
 (Tibetan)

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
 (Tibetan)

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
 (Tibetan)

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
 (Tibetan)

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
 (Tibetan)

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
 (Tibetan)

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
 (Tibetan)

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
 (Tibetan)

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.990
 Okay. Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank

02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:19.000
 you, everyone.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:25.230
 Thank you. Again, thank you very much, again, for having this opportunity to be discussing the

02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:26.000
 teaching of the Buddha.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000
 Dharma, as I said this morning, and organized. So thank you very much.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
 And I'd like to, all the Sangha members of the Palm Beach Dharma Center, as well as the

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
 friends of the Palm Beach Dharma Center, Sangha Dharma Center, and all the practitioners, again.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.000
 And the board members. And thank you very much, everyone, to organize and have this event.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
 So I'm so really thankful to everyone. Okay. Thank you, again. And, of course, whenever you

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:52.000
 practice,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000
 I wonder, already, these practices, I don't have to say, please, I have to say, please,

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
 continue to practice this. Complete this. And not just the practice, even after you complete

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000
 these wonderful practices. Really keep this practice, wonderful practice, as a foundation

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:15.000
 practice of whatever you practice. That was very special and meaningful of our practices.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:22.000
 And this, for example, great master, he's only doing it also many times in wonderful practices.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.000
 And great master, the popular languages are heard from great masters, such as Kenji Parnikar,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:34.000
 and others. He used to practice all the time, many, many times in wonderful practices.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.000
 And then so many other great masters, these practices. As I said, these wonderful practices,

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:46.000
 these four reversals, that will mind, mind, the training of the mind, always kind of reflect

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:52.000
 that even every, before the sessions of the practices, for example, really kind of breaks

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:58.000
 in permanent and causing every result of the eye. Effect of the eye. Inevitable, samsara

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.000
 is the nature of the difficult intervals. Reflect that thought. I said this morning,

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:10.000
 if we reflect that, it will make our heart more warmer, more softer, more tender,

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000
 and we become very practical. In the common sense level, in samsara level too.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000
 And then also it will make practice so fresh, so re-strengthening. Many times,

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:25.000
 our many times, practicing as a kind of start with very enthusiasm, very energetic,

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000
 and then almost kind of that fading with that.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.000
 Because of eye, it's also not reflecting enough these four, four reflections, thoughts.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:40.000
 We really reflect that our practice will become so fresh and so energetic, so rewarding.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000
 We don't have to feel relieved when we look back to our lives.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
 We're doing something so good and beautiful, we're moving forward.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
 So therefore, this window practice is so special, so beautiful.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
 And I again, so thankful to all of you who already practiced and completed that.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:02.000
 So wonderful, so beautiful. But I'd also like to encourage those who are starting now,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
 please practice this. This is embodiment of entirely Buddha teaching.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
 As I repeat many times, whenever you already know that. So it's so special.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
 That means we're touching to our own nature, our own beauty,

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000
 glorified that, making meaning for our lives, meaning for our lives,

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
 meaning for also somebody's lives or others.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000
 Those who we are associated with, our friend and family member,

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000
 and then to all the sentient beings. So therefore, thank you.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
 Please do the practice as much as you can.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:39.000
 And also, I thank very much everyone. Again, maybe there's someone watching this event.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.000
 And I wish you all, and thank you very much, your joyful effort and courage,

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000
 your commitment, willingness, and watching, and be with us.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.000
 Even though, according to Buddhas, in light means there's no difference

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
 between time and space, all in one instant state.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.000
 But now, even we don't have that realization and modern time,

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000
 we are all triggered in one single room and discussing, chatting,

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.000
 and feeling each other. So it's wonderful. I wish you, it's so beautiful.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.600
 I wish you all the great happiness, health, the beautiful to everyone.

02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:20.610
 Happy and health, beauty and fulfillment in our beautiful lives, something that we make so

02:21:20.610 --> 02:21:21.400
 different.

02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:28.300
 Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.

02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.300
 Thank you.

02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:38.800
 Adios. Adios. Thank you. Thank you. And what's it called? That's it.

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:52.200
 And adios, and hasta luego. Hasta luego. Hasta manana. Thank you.

02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:58.400
 And then I have some gift to you all. Do you have some announcement? Thank you.

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:05.400
 Good afternoon, everyone. Dear Viposhek, I have been given the humble task of expressing to you

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:08.700
 this afternoon the immense gratitude of this, our Sangha.

02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:15.000
 Please know that I speak for everyone here today when I say that my words convey the deeply

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.600
 heartfelt sentiment among everyone in this space.

02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:23.600
 We are forever grateful to you, your guidance, your compassion and your blessings.

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:28.000
 Thank you for your words of wisdom, your encouragement and your trust in us.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.400
 And thank you for bringing the teachings of the great masters to our untrained minds.

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:38.730
 Please know that your kind heart, your tender smile, and your steady patience are the light that

02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:41.000
 continuously illuminates our path.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:46.760
 In this day, you have brought to us the moon your practice, bringing us closer to the entire Buddha

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:50.000
 teachings and the teachings of the great Padmasambhava.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:57.000
 We commit to you to work with encouragement, devotion and joy in order to uncover our true nature

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.800
 and for the benefit of all sentient beings.

02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:04.200
 You are our guru, our teacher in your return to our future.

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.200
 Thank you, thank you very much for your kind words. Thank you.

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:12.000
 May I present to you this gift from the Sangha?

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.600
 Thank you, dear. Thank you so much.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.000
 Thank you very much.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:28.200
 Thank you everyone again, this beautiful thing.

02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:32.600
 And then I have some gift to you all. Please come up.

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:34.600
 And you have some announcements?

02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:39.600
 Yes, yes, please, please.

02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:47.450
 I just wanted to extend an invitation to everyone for next Saturday, November 1st to join Ben of La

02:23:47.450 --> 02:23:49.600
 Rinpoche and the Palm Beach Dharma Centre

02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:56.200
 to our fall gala event, "Share the Dream, Raise the Kumbha" at 6pm and it will not be held here.

02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:59.200
 It will be held at the Lucerne Lake Swim Club.

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:05.640
 This is a time of celebration commemorating the fruition of Venerable's Rinpoche's Dream called in

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.800
 Sherat Pemmeling Retreat Centre.

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:13.240
 And it's a time to now turn our energies towards its ongoing development, the building of the Kumb

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:15.000
ha that will be our shrine room.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.200
 So we hope you will come and enjoy an evening of delightful company.

02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:25.080
 Our food, entertainment, there will be a silent auction, as you have heard, of Tibetan Buddhists in

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.200
 Asian art, artifacts, jewelry.

02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:32.600
 And there are invitations in the living room along with directions for how to get there and those

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:34.200
 have all the information you need.

02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:40.280
 We ask that you please RSVP so that we know how many are coming in there as a list on the counter

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:41.200
 for that.

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:43.200
 So we hope that you'll join us for this evening.

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.450
 It will be a lot of fun, it will be a real time of celebration, a time to pray together and

02:24:48.450 --> 02:24:54.290
 celebrate the blessings we've been giving and the blessings that we are planting the seeds for for

02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:55.200
 the future.

02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:03.140
 Also, Lama Lorraine will be meeting us in Yanyanun near Retreat Saturday, Wednesday, Monday,

02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:03.200
 November 8th or 10th.

02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.500
 And this is a traditional Buddhist meditation practice based on the bit of compassion known as the

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:11.200
 Pazanang Chenrissi.

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:16.940
 It's a profound and powerful practice of silence and fasting that purifies karma and accumulates

02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:18.200
 merit and wisdom.

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:22.200
 There are also flyers available in the living room for this practice as well.

02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:36.620
 And for those of you who are taking refuge after Venerable Rifashe has bestowed his generous gift

02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:38.460
 to us, please join Kala's in the Lotus Room and he will help you to get settled for that very

02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:39.200
 beautiful opportunity.

02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.200
 Thank you, thank you, thank everyone, thank you, thank you.

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.200
 Yeah, please come up. This is what I said here.

02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:54.200
 This is his own Duryodhana, which is a photo and his handwriting, his teaching.

02:25:54.200 --> 02:26:02.200
 Maybe you have, you already have, but this is very counter-sized nicely and we can put with our

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.200
 ideas.

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:10.200
 What is it here? It's his own handwriting, his intubated, but it's translated here.

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:19.200
 Look at this photo, then look at your mind. Look at the one who is looking.

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:28.200
 If you see this, you are the excellent ones.

02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:35.200
 So that's it, please come up.

02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:11.200
 That's for you. When you look at it, it helps you with the level of your children in your body.
