00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Specifically Dzogchen Dzogchen practice. Why we need this Dzogchen practice? Because

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.440
 we need break down the dualities. Our duality mind, the happy depression is fired up

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.280
 way from the beginning of times. It's so strong, so thick, it's just a message to break down that

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:32.000
 and prepared our heart to more maturity. When planting the seed or trying to break the seed

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 and sprout of the Buddha nature or the enlightenment, we need good soil, good palm, good areas.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 So this Dzogchen practice, all were made ourself more prepared to Dzogchen practice and to develop

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.680
 the realization of the humanity. So conducted Dzogchen practice, those are really very important.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.480
 And there was together we need devotions, joy and appreciation, devotions. Dzogchen is

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.360
 monetized when we're intellectual or when we're skeptical and duality can't have a hard-headed

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 thought. Your other kind of Dzogchen is off. Kind of like so what's called this, so.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:34.640
 Not a problem. But it's a kind of all kind of this and nothing. It's not really, I mean,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 basically what that's not smart. Heavy Dzogchen is not smart. Smart, you're fully yourself.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.360
 Kind of have that attitude never my life because we're all equal. Even not just equal, maybe I'm

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 better than others too because we deep down we have the ego clinging, the ignorance, ego clinging.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 Ego clinging is self-important, self-centered mind. And we kind of self-distended thought,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.760
 attitude in our mind. So we feel kind of I'm quite good. Good, I'm good. I am kind of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.250
 that's it. That's it really. You can't feel that. And you have the devotion. That means you're

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 leaning

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.880
 that ego. Let it be bending. Let it be bending. Let it not stand like this, bending. And that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.120
 many people don't want. Ego is about self-important, that. Or why we need this, that. But according

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.200
 to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.360
 spiritual, according to Dharma, without slowing down, knocking down the ego clinging, you will not

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.560
 get realizations. And without the devotions, there is no realization will come. Dzogchen

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.120
 realizations comes. Ego is interference. Interference. Erogance is interference. When we

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.520
 have the arrogance, we don't see the good call it for others. And we don't see the bad call it is

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.880
 what ours are. Always looking others, trying to point, trying to target their arrows. In a debate

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.080
 they're saying, in your own face, they're just really they're saying, your own face,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:29.920
 yuck, yuck, yuck animal is going on your own face. You don't see that, but you see small, what's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.040
 called, leash. Lice. Lice. Lice is going the other side, other face, you see. You see the face,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.360
 lice going first or others, but you don't see yuck is moving on your own face.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.160
 Face. This is really true. That's the religion saying that. That's it. We don't kind of look

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.200
 ourself and we're always trying to pick up others, this and that, this and that, and then make the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.200
 gossips, this and that, make all the difference come, spreading that bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:16.880
 Bigger. This is what how really duality. So therefore, to break down, softening our duality

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.400
 and ego-cling devotion is so important. Particular practices in the dharma and particular

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.640
 realization is really is so, so important. And for that reason, Grand Master Sarasai in his

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.040
 teaching,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:43.040
 whoever have the devotion of his blessings, blessings from the lineage masters, that person

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:53.520
 will gain the realization right in that moment. And you look at the life story of the Munaripas,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 how every song that we need to join, he prays to the Marpa. And he said, "Marpa is the embodiment

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 attributes I praise to them." And even they don't call the names of the Marpa. He said, "The

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.280
 kindness

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:22.570
 ones, gracious ones, kindness ones, gracious ones, because I show that direct the nature of the

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.200
 mind

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.640
 and break out of the samsara mat to the enlightenment state so we can be one of the

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.720
 beneficial beings to all the beings." All the beings, that's what what is said, "gracious ones,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.440
 who is the embodiment of the acchobias." And it is the life stories of the lunkipas,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.800
 or jimmy lunkipas, and their songs, each song, same thing.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.640
 Oh, friends, you say, "The teacher who is embodiment, or who is the old Indian brother,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.880
 referring to the brother, some of the brothers." It's a strong devotion. When you have that strong

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.720
 devotion, then you get strong realization. That's the stories in the teaching. Say, at one time,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.080
 Atisha came to me, when she came to me, said, "One great man came to Atisha, asking, 'Oh, great

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.320
 teacher, please give me blessings.'" Blessings. And Atisha said, "All ladies,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:41.910
 students, give me the devotion." So she said, "The student, or maybe not lady, lose, lose, L-O-S-E,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.320
 or

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:51.520
 loses, not too tight, tight. Losing the student, give me devotion." Devotions. When you have the

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.200
 devotion, you receive the blessings. If you don't have the devotion, then the blessing is a job.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.120
 There's no blessings usually. That's it. If you want blessings, you have divorces. That's really

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.800
 the advantage. And again, that's one of the teaching, the great master, the owner of the

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:21.200
 schools of the Chirveda Buddhism. His name is Chobhaji Kismu. He said, "The sunlight of the

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.800
 devotions is not shining into the snow mountain of the glaciers. There is no blessing or water will

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.120
 come, blessing or water will come. When the blessing and water and water don't come, then

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:42.800
 how we can partilize or grow, grow of the enlightenment." So those are all, I mean,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.270
 important. And for that, also, there is the great teacher, Bhadakar Khemu, himself, on the ticam.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.520
 This, of course, is not just only one using them.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:08:00.640
 The realization of the Absolute Truth relies on devotions. Devotions, that's a shari term.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:10.230
 The realization of the Absolute Truth only will come by the devotions. Devotions are fed, F-A-I-T-H

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.880
, fed.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.920
 So therefore, the devotional is really important. For those reasons, to invoke the devotions

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.440
 is then calling on our path, and we join. Before we do the meditation, we say, "Well, I'll pray."

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.660
 All those we're joining, some are praying, some are praying, but in reality, we're invoking our dev

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.520
otions,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.440
 our joy and appreciation. I'm calling on our path is invoking the devotions. And for that reason,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.650
 great-master, he's only going to say. And also, the problem is the same thing. He's calling on our

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.560
 path.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:55.680
 It's not the prayer to the gurus, but the devotion is the prayer to the gurus.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.430
 The devotion is really so important. We have to have the spiritual realization, the Dhamma

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.400
 realization.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.040
 We have to, kind of like, don't carry course of the ego-cling and self-emotant and kind of like

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.520
 self-destructive attitude of that arrogant regime of thought and subnet and bring up genuinely

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.400
 all that respect and appreciation. And these devotions is so important. So I have the devotions

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.400
 and all those beautiful things as we make it. And then I sit down on the cushion or sitting on the

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.040
 chair and then with very good postures. And the Dokki teaching always said, and many of you know

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.920
 how many of you know that because in the teaching, it's the essence, the hard essence of the

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.320
 practice

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.360
 of the tukkuk that you said I mentioned many times, but I'm going to again here to remind you that

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:54.480
 that's called three immovables, three immovables. Immovable of the voting,
