00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.020
 Thank you. When we do a practice like we just did the Vajra Goliath practice, a wrathful deity

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.000
 practice, could you give us some advice on how to really do it properly?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.320
 Like a wrathful practice, like how do we make sure we're doing it kind of the correct way? I mean,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 when we do the visualization, wrathful or peaceful, semi-wrathful, any Buddha when we realize they

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.000
 are the embodiment of love and compassion and wisdom combined through it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.820
 That's even though they appeared as wrathful, but that wrath is not anger, emotion anger, a display

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.000
 of the two scary, negative emotions and neurotic minds.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.200
 The neurotic mind is always a regiment, always clinging something appears to us, kind of something

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
 nice appeared there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.710
 So the regular deity or wrathful deity is the contrary and opposite of to despair of that habit

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:24.550
ification of the clinging and attachment to those kind of like beauty or something that wanting that

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.000
.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.750
 So death is really the one with the purpose. But otherwise, all the Buddhas are same. All is best

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.000
 upon the compassion, loving kindness and the wisdoms.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.210
 And that also when we generate, of course, this sudden we follow it. This vertical pattern is very

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 small, particularly the black home practice, very small.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.830
 But when we joined first time, when you begin the home syllable, there's three homes, one of these

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.000
 three homes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.630
 This has so many meanings in the teaching mentioned that our simple way to explain this is the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.000
 three samadhis.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.940
 And the three samadhi is such as samadhi is Sanskrit word, which means meditation or the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 concentration or the understanding of the reality of nature as it is.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.190
 That is samadhis. So nature is what? Nature of every phenomenon, everything, both samsara and nir

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.000
vana is displayed.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.440
 There's no substantially solid existing according when you have the realizations. Really, there's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.000
 no substantially solid entity existing whatsoever.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.110
 It is all displayed. So first of all is that satyana samadhi means the absolute truth of the great

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.000
 emptiness, great emptiness.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 So when you see the whole phenomenon existing, is it a great emptiness? We joined many times the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.000
 emptiness, but emptiness is not negation state of the emptiness.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.720
 Emptiness is just the infinite qualities that beyond the minds. For example, if I say simply to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.000
 tell to our own mind, we all have mind and we believe we have mind.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.890
 But when you look to your mind, what we see, what we find, or what we really see, there's nothing

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.000
 really we can see.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.070
 I saw anything. I mean, that's a really true path, a true reality of the nature. Of course, I'm

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.000
 talking now with the mind.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.850
 But reality, the whole of this phenomenon is in that status. They hear, but when you look, elements

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.000
 get analyzed, there's no substantial solid entity existing whatsoever.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 So as modern time, the quantum physics, our discovery, our hurt, that's really the reality.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 But that is not just negation state. It's beyond. It is totally flexible.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 The whole flexible, the display, dynamic, this movement is just there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 It's not something that we detect immediately. It is mind bubbling status.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.320
 So first of all, we joined. We relaxed on the beyond of the conception of conception and beyond the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.000
 duality, say home.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.360
 Second home, that home is that state of the first state of the completely emptiness is not negation

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.000
 state as I said.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.190
 You read. You heard that in a book, and you read. This reading in a book, what we see is not just,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.000
 it's just saying that the top name is true, fact.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 It's not just believing. This believer has nothing to do. You always get it. Find out.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.350
 From that, the ordinary natural state is arising as the grid, then compassion. Compassion is the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.000
 nature of the mind.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Loving kindness is the nature of the mind. The wisdom is the nature of the mind.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 But yet we can't detect it. This is compassion. This is the loving kindness. This is the wisdom.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 And that we talked, our self is not just talking the story of the behind the mountain.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 This is the reality. Our own nature. We have love. We have compassion. We have wisdom.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Again, we have anger. We have jealous. We have all the doubt and hesitations. But where are those?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Where are those? Again, that's the best lesson. It's the emptiness.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 That's what the gracious teacher Buddha used the terminology, emptiness. That's it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 But that emptiness is not negation, blank, drag-hole, blue, kind of blank state or darkness state.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It's the fullness of dynamic qualities.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 What are those? In this case, loving kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.990
 This compassion, then the second home is representing compassion. Represent all, entirely universe

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.000
 and everything is filled with compassion.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.040
 Like as the morning sun shines when there are no clothes, no mists, the sunlight heat in the sky,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.000
 such a pervasive clear billion.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.730
 Like that, compassion, arising to every direction, there's no boundaries. Total probation, 360-

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.000
degree angles, everywhere.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:17.810
 That is the compassion without any partialities and without any kind of discrimination, but racial

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.000
 compassion.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.860
 The second home is the compassion. That combination, that emptiness, first home, second home

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.000
 combination, then third home.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Third home is the union of the emptiness and compassion. That is our own inner nature of the mind,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 now coming as the poem.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:53.300
 The small, subtle state has begun to develop. Third home, when we join, that moment, then instantly

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.000
, Vedagalaya effort.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 I myself, Vedagalaya, that's we join. That all appeared from that every home or the third home.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 So third home is, as I said, there is an essence of the love, compassion, and wisdom.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.030
 Wisdom, also emptiness, is another terminology, then the synonym of the wisdom. It's combined

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.000
 together.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.990
 That appeared, Vedagalaya. That home, even though that appeared at that home, all kind of totally

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:35.000
 breaking through the old duality conceptions that we never imagined that.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.770
 But nature is a dynamic. Nature is a display. Nature has no restrictions, according to the teaching

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.000
.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.330
 Can anything, water can be fire, fire can be water, water, and those who have capability, they can

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:57.000
 walk in the sky, they can sit on the sky, they can go through the walls, in the earth.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.280
 There's no restrictions. But due to the duality, we made restrictions. That is called mind created

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.000
 by the dualities.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.580
 It's not the nature created. Then dynamic display of that compassion, love, the wisdom, appeared as

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.000
 Vedagalaya.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.830
 The wrath of duty, that was scarce ego clinging, space on the neurotic mind, and habit patterns of

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:30.000
 this and that, completely smashed that in the state of the origin of the natural states.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.030
 So that is our regulation. When we visualize that, not just Vedagalaya, our sub, but the whole

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.000
 universe is formed in that medala.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Whole universe is in the state of the compassion, loving kindness, versus the display.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.210
 Whatever form, that is the medala of Vedagalaya, and that's what we join. With that meditation, in

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:05.860
 the teaching said, it will really break down neurotic thoughts and obstacles, hindrance, and bring

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:12.280
 up more of our inner qualities, inner qualities of the mind, and to benefit ourselves and all the

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.000
 beings.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.660
 So that's really what we really visualize. And then we join, joining mandarai, and all that is so

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.000
 powerful, so special.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.030
 As I said, he has studied too. This is Vedagalaya practice, one of the very special, really

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.000
 practices.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.910
 They said, "Practice in Vedagalaya is a Vedagalaya practice. Practice in Vedagalaya will have long

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:48.000
 lives. Practice in Vedagalaya will have prosperity.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.950
 Practicing in Vedagalaya will have more wisdom. Practicing in Vedagalaya has more power, more

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:04.000
 ability to help and to subdue, to dispel the negative emotions, the obstacles.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.760
 And the practice in Vedagalaya will bring the realization of the enlightenment within this lifetime

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.000
. Those are really teaching great master, great wisdom.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.460
 So I mentioned that. So Vedagalaya practice is really very, very powerful, special. As I said

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.000
 yesterday, Vedagalaya is very popular.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.670
 Of course, I knew my school as well as Kaji. But again, I missed somehow my mind that Vedagalaya

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.000
 practice is so popular in the Sada schools to be the Buddhism.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.150
 It was one of the four Sada great master who was the disciple of the Gurbam Masambhava Shandara Ch

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.000
uddah.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.690
 And they had received Vedagalaya teaching from Gurbam Masambhava, as well as other Bhuvallam Madras

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.000
.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 So Vedagalaya practice is very famous in Sada schools and as well as also in Gyalasabhos too.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So that is the little bit of Vedagalaya.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Thank you.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.030
 Can you also, could you mention a little Rinpoche about how these three samadhi that you mentioned,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:19.210
 how they're related with purifying our habits of like when we're dying and then after we die and

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.000
 during our life?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.050
 I guess the teaching said that the fourth Vedagalaya, I mean based upon the samadhi, such in the

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:39.180
 samadhi is when you have the realization that will bring realization of the dharmakaya, dharmakaya

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.000
 status.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.580
 And the second samadhi, this compassion, the samadhi, it will bring the realization of the sambhok

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.000
aya.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And then this dharmakaya status, the third one is bring the realization of the nirmakaya.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Those are really in the teaching sense.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 So fourth is that the satin, the samadhi is, will purify that experience.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 That experience, it will transform that experience into a dharmakaya status.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.230
 So that's every, I mean, of course there's more instructions, but that's the, the really mention is

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:29.360
 first is that when we're able to maintain in that status and then dharmakaya status, the moment we

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:38.330
 pass, the moment that we, we, we start about breathing, that moment, moment, that consciousness is

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.000
 trapped between two elements,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.150
 three elements, the wife and the dad element in heart center, moment you kind of, that won't stay a

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:55.460
 long time, that kind of the, the pulse of the, of the two elements, the one coming together and the

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.000
 consciousness is trapped between that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.750
 And lastly talk, just a second or a few seconds or just a short time, when is the spark, that, that

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.000
 pressure or that impact, impact, right?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.900
 In fact, when you kind of loosen up that, that moment, the consciousness of awareness is really so

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:29.000
 believed as like building the autumn sky, clay, clay, and brilliant fresh that in that moment.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.040
 And if people who had a good meditator in this lifetime, and the Dokhi meditation or one of our

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.000
 mother meditation, they can, can reach that moment, dharmakaya status.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.440
 Because the merging the, what sometimes the teaching mentioned, merging the, the, the, the child

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:58.820
 luminosity of the hour, during our day practice or life practices, merge to the mother, mother

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.000
 luminosity of the nature, mother nature.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.850
 Meeting the child luminosity to the mother luminosity, they completely merged in that moment, reach

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.000
 the dharmakaya status, status was enlightened.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.910
 So that is very, therefore, the suchness, samadhi, well purified habit pattern of the moment or

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:27.000
 death of that and the brain, the realization of the dharmakaya status.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.390
 And somehow we didn't, of course, we didn't get the realization that moment. Now, according to

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:39.560
 Buddha's teaching, if you all know, I think, then the part of beginning, the part of start

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.000
 experience.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And there's so many different regions, different disciplines that comes up, one after another.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.590
 But if people have the realization and good understand of such as the visualization, the meditation

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:02.000
, it is lifetime time, and that moment, then that this see this all display of the our own mind,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 display of our mind, display of the nature of the mind is love and compassion.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 So whatever the details, whatever the images is all one's own display.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Display of seeing that realization and see that it's samadhyakaya status.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:31.040
 So purify all that part of creation and transform into that samadhyakaya status, you reach

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.000
 enlightened.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.300
 And then somehow, again, we didn't get, couldn't connected our wealth. Now we continue flowing, you

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.000
 know, carry with the pulse of our habit pattern.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.460
 Now we will take rebirth. Rebirth, and that is according to Buddhism, there is no return. You will

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.000
 have, you take rebirth.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And what kind of rebirth we take? According to our karma, that's in Buddhism.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.150
 But the karma of our journey, our lifetime, operate with karma, according to karma, you take

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.000
 rebirth.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.140
 Where you will take rebirth, it depends with our own karmas. There is six destinations, take the

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.000
 karma. Those are called six rams, six rams.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.040
 So any of those places we can check. Among those six rams, three are called upper rams, and three

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.000
 are lower rams.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.280
 And this human rams and all the other upper rams. Upper rams. So you take the, you have to take the

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.000
 karmas.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 But that moment, again, this epsilon reconnected our self, withstand our awareness, and see this

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 part of our experiences,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.330
 and kind of withstand our practice during lifetimes, and then we can also transform that, that

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.000
 birth.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.160
 Choose our birth, not carry the pulse of the karma, but we can choose our relation with our

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.000
 concentrations.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.140
 And then some teachings said, we can't withstand your courage in your meditation, and connecting,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.000
 that I'm going to take the rebirth higher than.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And also with good poses, in the human realm, I'm going to take rebirth in a beautiful, barrenness,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 barrenness, with beautiful barrenness, I'm going to take rebirth.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And I'm thinking of that, and see that barrenness are like a guru, guru, our teacher.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.740
 Teacher, both are teachers, and really without any negative emotion, without any thought, and

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.000
 trying to concept, and choose the right parent,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.570
 and those are called the makai state of the realization, and the purifying habit patterns of the

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.000
 birth habit pattern, some really, and choosing the makai status of the birth.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 So those are the explanations.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Okay. Thank you. I see. What do you have?
