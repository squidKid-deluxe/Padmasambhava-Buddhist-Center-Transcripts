00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 Thank you very much for coming for this afternoon's discussion. I don't call it a book discussion

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.240
 because you are welcome to ask questions about anything pertaining to the Dharma that you

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.940
 are interested in. If you've been reading the book and you have questions, of course

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.440
 you'll have the best answers, humanly possible. Kempo, would you be kind enough to lead us

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 in the seven-line prayer, once in Tibetan, once in English, and then may we have a silent

00:00:42.340 --> 00:01:09.520
 meditation for about one minute.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:38.720
 I would like to thank you very much for your support. Thank you very much.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 Thank you.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 Thank you.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:03:08.700
 How begin? Good morning, Rinpoche.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.660
 This time we talk about three kyas, and this time our prayer book also has five kyas, five

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:26.100
 wisdoms. Can you please explain the five kyas, the Dharma kyas and the Bokeh kyas. Then with

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.420
 another two. Two, two is hiding behind the three kyas. They're there, according to the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.620
 teaching. They're there, but they're just hiding. Hiding behind the Dharma kyas or the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:56.660
 Sambhu kyas. Those three, five kyas, generally three kyas is very popular, but then these

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:11.820
 three extra kyas, that which is more explanation of the third kyas or Dharma kyas. Now again,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:31.440
 this Sanskrit language, Dharma kyas, I say this, Nirma kyas, Sambhu kyas, Dharma kyas,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.500
 Sobhava kyas, then indestructible kyas. Those are known as five kyas. These three are more

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:41.540
 division or aspect of the Dharma kyas. And these kyas, generally what it means, kyas

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:57.620
 is Sanskrit word, which means, is hip. H-E-A-P, I believe, is hip. Hip, that put so many things.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.070
 So what that means in the teaching said, because it means so many good call it, so many

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.880
 accumulation

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.020
 merit is resolved, so many accumulation merit is a bhut hoge de as those kyas, so therefore

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.780
 it's called kyas. And then, so the last two kyas is Dharma kyas, but within the Dharma

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.420
 kyas is Sobhava kyas, that means what is called. If it's Dharma kyas, if it's true kyas, Dharma

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:39.780
 kyas, if you say what means Dharma kyas. The clarity aspect of the true nature is named

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:47.300
 as Dharma kyas. And Sobhava kyas is emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is called

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 Sobhava kyas. And what is Indestructible kyas? And that is union of the emptiness and clarity.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:07.380
 That is known as the Indestructible kyas. So that makes it five kyas, five kyas. And

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.340
 then this is generally every, we all have that potential. It's nothing that we don't have.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.300
 We have that right now, each of us according to teaching. But however, our this nature

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:31.760
 of the five kyas is very much hiding behind our habit patterns. That habit pattern is

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.300
 also created by us. It's nobody else really overloaded, but it is hiding. But when we

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.020
 begin to process to clear away the habit pattern, then those kyas and the kyas begin to shine

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.260
 according to our capabilities. So now this, when we're talking five kyas is fully developed,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:59.980
 fully bright, glorified kyas, such as the kyas of the Buddha Shakyamuni, Gaurabhema Sambhava,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.900
 and Vedya Sattva. Those are then have all that five kyas. They're total enlightenment

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.640
 fully. But we have that nature. We have that qualities. And then, I think you mentioned

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.460
 five versitums. I'm sure many of you already know the five versitums. Again, it is five

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:26.620
 versitums are the nature of our, again, mind. Mind is intelligence. It's versitums. But

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:34.500
 how these versitums are operating is a, a versitum means is an outer operating and an inward

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.020
 operating

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:42.460
 call it. So therefore, then these five versitums are known as, again, I'm sure many of you

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.660
 know that. Few of you don't know, but maybe don't know, but these five versitums, first

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:56.460
 is, I mean, if we count these first dharmadattu versitums, then go to the merrow-like versitums,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:04.140
 then to the equanimity versitums, then to the discrimination, awareness versitums. I think

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.100
 that's what translate it. And then is all accomplishing versitums. So those are known

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:16.220
 as five versitums. And dharmadattu versitums is the emptiness aspect of the versitums.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.780
 Nature of all those versitums are also empty, empty. So dharmadattu versitums, that is really

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:31.100
 basic nature. From that nature, emptiness, then these four versitums are reflecting a coordinate

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:39.550
 needed. And merrow-like versitums means what? Every kind of symbol is just a metaphor. But

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.740
 everything,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.020
 for example, this, again, we have two, we all have these five versitums. Well, our five

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.860
 versitums are not fully shiny, developed. Again, this is our habit, depending on the

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.700
 obscurations. But merrow-like versitums means, because when we see things, when you look to the

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:04.380
 objects, when you say, I saw that, I heard that, I smelled that, but we heard that, how you find?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:11.660
 It's like merrow images. It really reflects to you, merrow image. That is merrow-like versitums.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:17.660
 I mean, that's it. It's merrow. It's merrow. In the merrow, when we say, the poems appear in merrow

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:17.660
,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:24.220
 but where is that poems? In which part of the merrow is existing? You can't really see. I don't

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.540
 know. I mean, maybe you know more better than me. And the scientists say, scientific lives,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:35.020
 loves, loves. Maybe you know better. But, I mean, there's nothing to explain. But really,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:41.900
 you see. So, this is the same thing. Mind is like that. We reflect all the senses, according

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:49.500
 to that situation and circumstances. That's the merrow-like versitums. That's it. But we have,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:57.740
 but our is just a, again, is a dimmed, dim. And then, the econimite versitums. Econimite

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.020
 versitums, when we see all the things, things, no matter whatever, there's a big or the small,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:09.680
 is this, all is the same. When it comes to the mind, it's the same. There's no dependent comp

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.140
artments,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:18.700
 no different places. It's just all is there. And then, nature is the same. Also, empty. It's the

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:27.420
 same. So, that's called the econimite versitums. But when they're reflecting that, even though it's

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:33.420
 econimite, even if they're reflecting it to this merrow image, you know we need to come to your

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:42.460
 mind. Distinctively, everything is so clearly, precisely. Precisely. And that is then, what's

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.940
 translated as discrimination, awareness, versitums. Or maybe we can translate it as clearly,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.260
 knowing,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:58.380
 distinctively, exactly as it is, versitum that. That is clear, versitums. And then, the next one is

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:58.380
,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.860
 pick the one, is the old, a complex versitums. Because of understanding knowledge,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:14.380
 things, what we are a complex in the world. Ourself, to the others, is by our mind, our versitum.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:21.100
 Otherwise, there's no movement, no achievement, no advances. Everything is really dependent

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:28.220
 absolutely with the knowledge of our versitums. Whether that's big or that is small,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:36.700
 we're a complex. So, that is called, that aspect of the, is called a complex in versitums. So,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:47.260
 those are the five of us. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, yes. Oh, thank you. Jeff.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:55.100
 My question is somewhat less esoteric, but it's something that we don't ordinarily address, which

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:05.100
 is the dangers of practice. Dangers of practice. Yeah. And page 45 of the root text, it mentions

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.780
 that the great profundity of this Dharma carries obstacles with it in the same way that great

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.700
 profit goes together with great risk. At the place where you practice, spirits will show. Anybody

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:22.220
 has a book, book that, can I borrow it just for one minute? I think this is important. It's not

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:29.580
 something we often, to which we often refer. 45, Marianne. Thank you. Page 45. Thank you.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:36.700
 It's in the root text. Okay. Okay, that's good. 45.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:51.420
 I think it's a brilliant passage. It's something that my concern is where in our practice

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:58.380
 might we go where at the place where you practice, spirits will show their forms. I'm sorry. Again,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.060
 could you help? I don't really know the Romanian. No, I guess I asked you on fortune, right?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.460
 Forty-five. That's because it's a Romanian, right?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:15.660
 It's the last paragraph on page 45. It's an easy one. Oh, it is 45. 45. Okay.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:39.260
 And for anybody who hasn't read it, it's really a frightening paragraph.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:49.100
 It promises you'll acquire a bad reputation, close friends will turn into enemies, and so on.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:56.300
 Now, we all know that there is a danger to the practice, because if you go too far advanced

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.180
 without the right instruction, there are the obstacles. Yeah, yeah. But what are some of the

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:08.460
 early signs that maybe our practice is starting to stray off into this dangerous territory?

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:16.300
 That's different. Yeah? Okay, so there's a definitely, I mean, we can all experience it.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:24.540
 And not can be, it will go, we all have these kind of experiences, one after another. Really

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.860
 well-happened that. The first, the foundation of our practice is, generally talking, the foundation

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:30.860
,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:40.620
 the bolder, B-O-U-L-D-E, our bolder of our practice is courage, commitment,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:50.700
 and devotion, and bodhicata. Those are really the bolder of that. And also, same time, humble

00:14:51.260 --> 00:15:00.460
 and humility. Humility. Those are the bolder. And now, with those bolders, or with that anchor down

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:00.460
,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:09.340
 your salt and your practice are continuous. Then, there is, sometimes, we think, maybe, I mean,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.180
 begin to practice Dharma, and everything goes really well, and smooth, and all that things.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:22.780
 It's true, our goal, that is our goal. But on the path, definitely we can experience,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:29.900
 in that journey, we can experience many things, things, and up and down, and all that things.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:38.620
 Because according Buddhism, that is due to our karma. Practice is, we are cleansing the karma.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:48.030
 There is good karma, there is bad karma. And what we are doing, this practice, we are increasing

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.140
 the

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:58.380
 good karma, and purifying the unnecessary, unhealthy, or bad karma. So, therefore, powerful

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.020
 practices,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:09.100
 practices will convert quickly, or roughly, begin to really cleanse in the bad karma.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:16.940
 And those bad karmas begin to reflect many different ways. Those are, then, I mean,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.780
 this is here, clearly mentioned, one after another, his own dungeon, which is dead. But we can't

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:29.820
 summarize all the obstacles. Obstacles, and that is generally terminology in the Buddha's teaching,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:38.380
 is known as poor demons. Poor demons, and the force is known as demon of the emotions.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.860
 The demon of the emotion, this poor demon is, again, a metaphor. It is not something that really

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:53.260
 exists, a figure, outside, not necessarily, but it is, because they are obstacles. Therefore,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.660
 it is a demon. It is a demon because we think that demon is bad, and it is a bad obstacle.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.380
 So, that is what they use, the metaphor. Personally, it is like demon of the emotions.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:15.100
 The demon of emotion is, many times, when we practice, this is what is arising here. Here,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:24.380
 for example, that appeared in these forms. Demon of emotions arises this, arises, and they also are

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:32.060
 then what? Sometimes, some externally appeared, inwardly appeared. The part, mostly important,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:40.140
 as I said, the border of the practice is courage, and commitment, and devotions, and practices,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.940
 such as zuking practice. And zuking practice, what in the teachings, again in the Buddhism,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:52.380
 Buddha's teaching said, let it come, let it go. Be in the, be, be as it is.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.380
 Trying to avoid, trying to do things in this emotion, arise in the kind of comfort, like me,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:05.980
 against the back and forth, that is the creating the turbulence. You're supporting, you're helping,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:12.460
 we are supporting, we are helping, we are activating that. So, therefore, the best in

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.620
 zuking teaching, let it come, let it go, let it be that way. Whatever it comes,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:25.420
 keep the courage, keep the confidence. And that is, is, so that means you are really,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:32.140
 if we have that capabilities, we are controlling our mind, we are keeping balance, we are anchored.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:40.380
 But every distracted that, that means our mind is now, are unstable. Distracted means we are

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:47.420
 unstable. Then, that could become bigger and bigger. And that is, then become, that, that,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:53.100
 that means, then in kind of like, some other terminology about the teaching said, we couldn't

00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.380
 control our own perceptions. We are not really controlling. And zuking don't have to control,

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.500
 as I said, let it come, let it be, relax on the present status. Not really bothering that.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:14.940
 But then, if that happen, then is all different things can happen. Externally, things can happen,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.300
 as in the teaching said here, teaching things, kind of maybe, even the images, the figures are

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.620
 coming

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:26.940
 that, images, the figures coming, those are the, also the kind of frightening things, images,

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.380
 figures are calling and all different things. There's a variety of this. So, this, that is,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.940
 then emotion involved. Maybe something, do this of the anger and frightening. And or maybe

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.580
 sometimes

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:47.020
 more attachment, more patience, more desires come, more greed is arising that. And thinking that's

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:52.780
 kind of good and all those things. These are all known as the, then, then is known as the,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:20:00.140
 it's called the emotion. Most of them, generally, all the obstacles are, are best on the emotions,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.150
 emotions. But that time, the most important is keep the practice, keep the, remember the

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.780
 instructions.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.300
 Remember the instruction, keep that. And of course, some health issues come,

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.340
 only troubles come. Then, then definitely do you have to solve the trouble or take the medicines

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:23.580
 and all your best. But not too much completely. Emotions are swinging back and forth. Then we

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:30.140
 lost and really grown, grown to that. And then good things also happen. This is among the four

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.100
 demons,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:39.100
 four demons. The second, I mean, second or the next demon is called demon of the, demon, demon

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:47.890
 of the pleasing, pleasing demon, pleasing. And that is, again, comes something so kind of nice

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.300
 looking,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:54.380
 nice ways. And here, say, there may be the, there's some kind of, it appears that they're talking

00:20:54.380 --> 00:21:00.380
 something nice things and predictions. You're doing good, this and that things, all that. But

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:07.180
 if those happened again, if you keep that, you'll continue your practice as it is, then there's no

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:14.860
 obstacles at all. But we carried with that, that good kind of prediction, good science and good

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:24.460
 omen and believe on that and to act with that way. Then it's called demon. We can, many, many in

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:24.540
 the

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:32.140
 history, in the teaching, in Buddhism, Buddhism, those, even at once the practitioners are really

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:39.100
 become obstacle because the, this demon of the pleasing is a very sneaky, sneaky. Looks, it is

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:46.860
 so beautiful like that, but that is honey put on the razor blades. Honey put in the razor blades

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:55.660
 and then it will, oh, poison covered by the chocolate. It could be big poison, it could be

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:02.460
 small poison, but it is a poison. That's called pleasing demons. And that also can come, kind of,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.340
 as many people are going to talk, oh, how nice you are, how beautiful you are, how you are great,

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:12.140
 this and that. And you're also achieving lateral kind of good things. And then you feel also

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.340
 something kind of, oh, maybe I'm really good, must be good, kind of more elevated our ego and then

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:26.860
 ignore the common ground, this basic thing. That is a demon. That's it. So therefore,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:35.340
 always should anchor down our practices be in this. We keep the instructions. Then you're winning,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:42.780
 you're controlling and you're subduing demons of the pleasing. And then, oh, really completely

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:50.940
 activating more and more good ways. And the next one, the next three are then is just three demons

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.900
 are known as the demon of the aggregates. Also our physical things are, we just have to keep more

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:04.460
 balance. Not too much, not too little. And we're trying to do too many things with our body. And

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:12.060
 then we just endless. So therefore, what in the Buddha's teaching opens it, the body is a vehicle,

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:21.660
 body is like boat. Boat, keep nice and don't ignore, but yet you don't have too many decorated boat

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:21.740
.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:29.340
 Pleasing completely, yachting, all those, whatever the modern common is, trying to get everything.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.780
 Then I think it goes on and on. It's just too much distractions. But also not completely ignore

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:34.940
 that

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.780
 because this is really neat. I mean, this body is so special, beautiful. So everyone in the Buddha

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:40.780
's

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:48.540
 teaching opens it, said balance. Balance, middle way. That is really what teaching says. So then

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:56.220
 you're controlling or you're subduing the demon of aggregates. And then the next one is the demon

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.180
 of the deaths. That is then, that we all have to go through that. No one is exception. But if you

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.180
're

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.780
 good practicing, if you're practicing, then the death is just another change. It's nothing

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.100
 particular. There is always a day, there is always night. It goes on and on. In reality, nature is

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:23.660
 same as great emptiness state. So then those are known as demon, but demon of the controlling or

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:30.860
 the subduing, the demon of the dead. So this is what really explaining this. But mostly important,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.900
 practitioners, when you kind of get some nice realization, good things or something,

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.300
 or some kind of obstacle comes and then they kind of disappointed. They lost their courage and

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.460
 commitment and confidence and then kind of almost started blaming to the teaching, blaming to the,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:55.340
 to one's own self at the end. Those are then really is obstacle. That is a demon. So therefore,

00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:01.980
 he said, watch out all that. So that is my brief explanation of the obstacles. Thank you very much.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:26.460
 Thank you for taking my question. I just have two very general ones. One is the Buddhist practice

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:32.860
 of mindfulness. Like how do we in our everyday lives become more mindful people? The second

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:43.340
 question is how, this is perhaps a longer one. How would you maybe describe the Buddhist concept of

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:53.340
 love and people who are being introduced to Buddhism? Some things I understand. Suppose I

00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:06.780
 understand this. The mindfulness is generally, mindfulness is wisdom, is intelligence. And also

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:14.380
 mindfulness means that you look occasionally you're taking to yourself, taking in your mind

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:21.180
 by yourself. That is really the mindfulness. So that can be, for example, where is my mind

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:30.860
 and kind of take, take the kind of normal, nice breathing and look to your mind. Even one second,

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:38.300
 or two seconds, if you do that, according to teaching it really will help to kind of calm down

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:45.020
 whole systems. Not just only mind is coming, but when mind is coming, the whole systems of our

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:52.060
 bodies, movement, energy, everything is beginning to calm down. But at the time when we're not

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:58.300
 mindfulness, that means we're looking always outside. We're distracted by the old object with

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:05.820
 six senses. One of those, just carry it. And then maybe many times, together, just so busy. And our

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:14.060
 energy, our everything is just so in a way almost like turbulence status. But when you do this,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:22.060
 look to your mind and with normal breathing, just for a few seconds, it really creates the whole

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:29.580
 systems, calm and peaceful. And that is the beginning of the mindfulness. Then all different

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.420
 thoughts, kind of respect and appreciating, kind of appreciating for a few seconds. That is

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:44.620
 mindfulness. Appreciating. And appreciating of myself or one's own self. Appreciating to the others

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:44.620
,

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:52.780
 kind of be happy of all good things you have. That is mindfulness. Also feel compassion

00:27:52.780 --> 00:28:00.220
 to yourself, to the others. What is happening in the world, just even for a few seconds.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:08.060
 So those are all really mindfulness because these are all our inner treasures. Love is our inner

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:15.820
 treasure. Compassion is our inner treasure. And during application is our inner treasures.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:24.380
 And all the inner treasures, whatever, whenever we reflect to that, we are settling ourselves.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:31.980
 When we are in the emotional status, we are out. Really we are out. Our mind is not with us. We are

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:40.620
 not with the treasures. We are carried by the turbulence of the unhealthy habit appearance

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:47.340
 of the mind. It is carried. And then you create a rest. That's all that. So the mindfulness,

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.980
 then with that, like with those thoughts, and if you are sitting for a few minutes or one,

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.780
 five minutes, ten minutes, just calm, peaceful, that's all. Mindfulness, meditation, because you

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:05.580
 are really touching to the deep nature of the on our beauty, call it this. You begin to see things

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.100
 very beautifully, nice and calm, peaceful. Or even there's trouble and difficult things happening

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:19.100
 that at least you got something calm and really performative. So that is kind of in a way the

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:25.900
 mindfulness, the probability, so mindful that. And then love, as I already mentioned, is the true

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:33.740
 nature of the mind. It's part of our treasures. But Buddhism, love is generally, love is for all

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:39.820
 every living beings that we can do. Just really that. And that is just, we don't, exactly we don't

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:46.140
 know how to do that. But we pray, such as the great master in the lineage teaching Americans,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:53.180
 may all living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness. Thinking of those world and the

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:59.100
 relaxing of our mind, then reaching that true kind of like spreading that light of that energy to

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.740
 all

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:07.660
 living beings. That is really loving kind, love of the Buddhism. Generally, love is important,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:16.380
 special, beautiful, really that. But the love with emotion, that is, as I already mentioned, is not

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:26.370
 maybe exactly, but it is like honey with a razor. Maybe not exactly, but you can be lined up in

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:26.540
 that

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:32.860
 direction. So with emotion, then you just become, you could get like trouble too.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.020
 Okay. Thank you.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:51.340
 Thank you. When we look at the nature of our mind, and we might be able to recognize that there's

00:30:51.340 --> 00:31:01.020
 nothing there, but yet we talked about our mind. So, do you understand?

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:10.620
 Yeah, yeah. I hope so. I hope so. But we're talking about there's nothing. That's how we are smart.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:25.740
 But this, I think, this, when there's mind, this, when there's nothing, that is the absolute level

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:35.020
 of the mind. So, I mean, everything, everything in the samsara, nirvana, all that according to

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:41.820
 our gracious teacher, the Buddha here is summarized into truths. That's called relative truths and

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:52.700
 absolute truths. So, the mind is also within these two truths. So, that's what it's called.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:59.500
 How we discover the absolute truths. When you look, when you investigate, when you're analyzing,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:08.540
 you find the absolute truths. That is really the absolute truth. When you don't analyze,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:17.660
 don't ever analyze and investigate, then we are in a relative world. That is just kind of a

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:24.540
 roughly idea, roughly idea. So, when we don't analyze and don't investigate, then mind is here.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:30.060
 I mean, that's what we're doing. All this is here, and not just mind is here. We divided mind

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:40.620
 also in Buddhism six, add consciousness. Not just one mind, add consciousness. And then we divided,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:49.340
 I mean, the teaching said, conception divided 51 or 52 conceptions. All those dividing, division.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:57.900
 And then, so, but that is all relative truths. So, relative truth is, yes, is existing, and that's

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:04.460
 what we're doing. That's what happiness is here, sadness is here, and all the trouble is here,

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:10.700
 frightening is here, and excitement is here. Everything is nothing really ignored, nothing really

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:19.900
 decline or say no. It's all here. Talking about absolute level, but then we look at each of those.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.900
 As we're talking, we're trying to find where is that. What is that? Then the answer is the same.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:33.260
 There's nothing that we can find by these conceptions. By these conceptions. That is

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.780
 also nothing find is that something is talking or nothing to find, but that is a conception too.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:45.740
 That is also a conception. For that reason, to kind of apply that to bring that to kind of clearly

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.220
 as

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:52.780
 much as you can call it of the absolute truth, what most of the time said, beyond the conception.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:34:01.900
 Beyond the conceptions. So, those are what really sit there. So, that, but absolutely level,

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:08.060
 if we discover the absolute level as it is, then related truth they all talk at them.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.580
 Talk at them, they're not really different. And then, when we just kind of have the more meaning

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.940
 of this, for example, when meditating or the joking, joking or absolute truth, then this

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:25.100
 relative truth become also magical display. Magical display, and it's not something that

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.740
 kind of way. We hold this relative truth so strongly, solid, and concrete, and that's making

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:38.380
 all this kind of uncomfortable. So then, when you realize that, then you won't do that.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.900
 That is just all displays. It's the same nature. So, even though you go through the different

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.140
 things,

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:51.340
 but you know, in the inner level, those individualism is just seeing that as a display.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.900
 Okay, here's the thing.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:07.580
 Good morning, mademoiselle. When you speak of beyond conceptualization, and primordial wisdom,

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:14.860
 and absolute truth, and how all of it is just absolutely perfect,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.660
 and that was the pre-existence of everything from beginningless time, how did this happen?

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.180
 I mean, everything was perfect, and then all of a sudden, here we are suffering and making

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:34.460
 mistakes left and right. Why did this happen? That, according to that, is happening because

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:44.540
 we mishandled our display. And that is the, you, I'm sure when we joined that prayer of

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:53.900
 Kunduzampu, that tells really very clearly, tell that. And what in the teaching said that basically

00:35:53.900 --> 00:36:04.230
 ground you and I, Kunduzampu, share the same, same, there's that. But how that happened? Then, for

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.540
 us,

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:13.020
 that split it. In the samsara, nirvana, we were created two junctions. And that is the beginning,

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:24.780
 that is, when the display of the primordial arises, we grasping, we hold, we hold. And you didn't,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:32.460
 we didn't recognize is our own displays, we created subject object. Same time, according to

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.100
 teaching,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:39.180
 that moment in a way, certain, I mean, the Kunduzampu prayer said, there is certain kind of fears,

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:51.020
 fears, f-e-a-r, fears. When you have the fear, then next is hope. Hope is they go by side by side.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:59.740
 Then you're strengthening or we're strengthening the dualities. We're tied up or the building of

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:08.540
 the dualities. Then that expanded, that's expanded, and then ego claim came. Ego claim. Ego is also

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:16.540
 not substantial, solid exist. Is it? Is it? Mind. But we create ego. Any ego created that

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.260
 immediately,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:25.740
 then we created the active emotions, the six emotions, or five emotions. Then whole, the show

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.300
 begins.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:37.340
 Then our show is, our movie is already here. Project it, begin, and then see the movie of the

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:44.780
 six realms. All going on and on. On and on. Until we dissolve the projection.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:38:01.740
 Hi, Rinpoche. My name is Angel and I'm new, very new. And in listening right now, kind of from a

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.260
 little bit of an outsider's perspective, trying to get in, I'm questioning whether or not there's

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:13.500
 a conflict between any person, especially a person like myself, wanting to strive for

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:22.700
 excellence or to be better, to improve my whole job and work-life situation. If there's a conflict

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:30.140
 between that and the practices of the Dharma, is there something with my ego that maybe it's not

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:37.260
 the right path to take? I'm looking for, I'm seeking the wrong path. And that, Angel, this is, of

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:37.580
 course,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:46.140
 it depends up to you, how you feel that. It's all started with you. Really, how you feel this path

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:52.780
 is what we're talking, looks like kind of appealing, nice, comfortable. Comfortable is helpful,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:58.700
 and that is then, that's what is good. But somehow, it's not exactly good or it is a conflicting,

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:05.660
 it is not that. That is then, is not suiting with your mind, so is not suitable. So, that is

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:14.140
 generally, you just say, you have the first, like, to handle that situation. But Dharma, what we're

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:20.940
 discussing is nothing alien, nothing strange, nothing foreign. We're talking about our mind.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:27.820
 Whether you believe or not believe, or whether whatever it is religions you have, we all have

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.980
 the mind. Everyone, whatever religions you are, or spiritual, you follow, or whether you don't

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:40.540
 have the spiritual, but everyone wants happy, and joy, and peace, and comfortable, and fulfillment.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:48.380
 That is true, the hundred percent everyone, very true. So, this, what we're talking, discussing,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:59.100
 it's definitely is a special tool and a method to achieving peace, calm, and joy, and appreciation.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.460
 Also, let more understand, not narrow the corner of our knowledge. We are kind of opening our broad

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:11.740
 view, broad way understanding. Understand this, definitely. So, therefore, generally, I don't say

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:18.140
 really, but conflict to any beliefs. What we're discussing is love and compassion. It's actually

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.460
 deepening. If you have the spiritual belief, it will deepen it. It will know more exactly,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:29.100
 because the Buddha's teaching, it's not just a vague teaching. It's so thorough, so precise,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:36.300
 and so down to the earth, down to the earth, so precise. He touched the core of whatever that is,

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.740
 really, that is. So, it's not just a kind of a leap. There's some kind of an outside choice there,

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.220
 but

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:51.180
 whether you are solving, solving your own situation, whether you're making your understandable,

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.340
 understandable, and then moving forward, or they deepen our self.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:01.420
 Thank you so much. Great. Thank you.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:09.100
 Rinpoche, thank you so much. I'm thinking about the golden age. They talk about the time of Ashok,

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:20.220
 King Ashok, in the golden age. So, what did they mean by a golden age? I mean, you know,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:26.220
 is that like on a relative level that everything was, you know, going well, or is that a dharmic

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.900
 thing? How did it happen, and why did it end? According to the teaching, golden age is really

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:41.340
 the beginning of the kind of generations. This now is called the degeneration times,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:49.020
 but golden age is the beginning of that era or generation. According to the teaching, golden age

00:41:49.020 --> 00:42:00.940
 time, everything is so easy. Everything is so calm and peaceful. And according to the teaching,

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:07.820
 at the very early beginnings, there's, I mean, it's a little different than the

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:16.140
 evolution of what the scientist says. It's a little different. At the beginning time of this,

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:27.500
 this, the universe begins, at that time, that every human being has their own glowing light.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:36.380
 And they're all, also there is no need to harvest it. There is unharvested crops are growing,

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:45.180
 growing that. And there is no kind of fighting and curling going on. And the emotion is so low,

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:54.460
 low and calm and peaceful. So, that, those are really known as beginning of the golden age.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:01.020
 Then it began to kind of like, emotions have become, why that begins decreasing that because

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:07.260
 of the emotions. Then emotions are getting stronger and stronger. And then all the situations,

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.900
 what you have the old, you know, that is beginning to kind of fading away, slowly, slowly. And then

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:22.220
 they start to kind of like, begin to, to do the what called the like, territorials become

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:29.440
 territorials. And then they start to kind of become more subject and I and you and this and that,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.820
 that.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:35.580
 And then, then began to that time. Then according to teaching, they started, because they start

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.940
 beginning to curling, curling of fighting or something effect, not really big things. But they,

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:46.220
 then they appointed the kings. And those are not at the beginning time, according to Buddha

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.020
 teaching,

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:54.140
 kings are, king, leaders are appointed by the people and they cease, kind of selected. So,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:44:00.900
 it's called manpukurva yapu, means the honored one by everyone. So, it's like democratic, of course

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:00.940
,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:06.380
 that time. Then that emotion becomes stronger and stronger and those who are elected that,

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:12.940
 those by the democratic ways, they like to stay in the power themselves, not elation. Then you

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:18.620
 call the kings. Then kings that they are ruling this and that thing. So, then emotion become bigger

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:18.700
,

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:28.060
 bigger and bigger. And then the golden age is transformed to the, I think, so the need, then

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.060
 second, second, second generation. That means that whatever the golden age has, it become hub,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:41.340
 hub. So, second. Then it kind of continue growing, growing and then become something in it a bit,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:48.140
 they say something, means then three quarters left, left. That lasts longer, then continue growing.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:58.300
 And then that change it to the, to the, to the, that degeneration. So, now it's the generation

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:06.750
 things. So, that is like, yeah, that's what, how, let's just explain. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.100
 Yes.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:19.500
 I can't, a couple weeks ago you told me that the ornament of the wrathful deities was fire.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:27.980
 And I was trying to understand that. Now, one of the things that's influenced my practice

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:35.020
 as much or more than anything since I've been coming here, is something from Shantideva. What?

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:41.260
 Something from Shantideva. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. He said that we need to guard our minds

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:48.620
 the way we would guard a wounded or broken arm while walking through an unruly crowd. Yeah.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:57.580
 So, that's, that's quite a, quite a challenge to do that. Because it's asking, it's really asking

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:57.740
 me,

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:04.540
 it's asking us to sort of be, be so attentive to the mind even before the words come.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:14.060
 And connecting that with fire, that, you know, once I heard Krishnamurti give a talk called

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:21.340
 the fire of attention. That at a certain intensity and passionate quality, attention becomes like a

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:27.740
 fire. And it seems like I need to almost have that in order to, you know, watch the mind before the

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:36.620
 words come. So my question really is, this is like, what then is the garment of the wrathful deity?

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:42.900
 You said that's the ornament fire of the wrathful deity. What's the garment? Garment? Garment,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.740
 clothing.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:52.780
 Garment. Garment. Yes. Garment of the white umbrella. White umbrella is old variety of the

00:46:52.780 --> 00:47:02.140
 divine clothes. So silk, silk and different colors. I mean, silk. And then also the necklace and

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:02.300
 the

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:08.700
 bracelets are all basically peaceful. But this is the wrathful deity. That would be the peaceful

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.020
 deity.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:16.380
 This what's called the white umbrella is semi-wrathful. Semi-wrathful. Semi-wrathful. Okay.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:26.700
 So therefore she has all those peaceful, you know, appealing, appealing ornaments. But at the same

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:34.540
 time, then she has as, of course, it depends with many different emanations. But many times, then

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:34.780
 she

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:46.860
 has many eyes, many arms and holding many different what's called weapon, weapon areas or the

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.180
 ancient

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:55.740
 those things. And those are all, and then she has also kind of semi-round eyes. Eyes are like not

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:02.780
 completely round, but not completely kind of peaceful way. Those are all known as semi-wrathful,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:13.100
 wrathful aspect of that. So she is, she is that, I mean, the wrathful, semi-wrathful. So those are

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:22.300
 known as the, but what I say those, one point you in the, you asked and I mentioned the bone

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.860
 ornament

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:29.660
 something, maybe I said that, and that is, is very wrathful. And that is also wrathful ornament.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:38.380
 That is more connected to the inner tantrums. This white umbrella is more connected

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:45.980
 and outer tantrums, outer tantrums. So therefore, it is slightly different than that.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.620
 Thank you.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:53.740
 That's it. And then, of course, what do you say these great master Shandai, Shanti Deva said,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:49:00.940
 "God your mind as you want, God your own want." And that is really excellent. I mean, all the

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.060
 teaching, that's what really the mindfulness. Mindfulness, that means not just a once in a

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.740
 while brain, the mindfulness, but it should have the mindfulness always with you. And that is

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.140
 really

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:18.780
 what that will make the big difference. And in the same line in those teachings, Shanti Deva says,

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:27.740
 there's nothing better practice than guarding your own mind. Mind. There's nothing more

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:35.660
 better practices or ascetic practices than guarding your own mind. And if you don't guard

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:44.300
 your mind, what, what other practice it will do to you. Therefore, I will put, with folded hands,

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:50.700
 I will request to you all, guide your mind. That's what Shanti Deva said. Really, I mean,

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:57.740
 all those wonderful, if you read that first chapter or the second chapter of the Shanti Deva,

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:05.020
 I mean, it's just absolutely like perfect, great teachings on the mindfulness that as

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:12.460
 admire and follow all those great masters in Tibet. Really, that all schools, whatever,

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:21.180
 believe them, not just some that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then I just told maybe,

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:27.260
 we doing the breathing pre-efficacy exercise, right? Yes. I think many of you know already,

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.620
 right? Yes. No, but few of you don't, you know that what means breathing pre-efficacy exercise?

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:39.420
 No. Sometimes. No, that's it. Yeah. Of course, maybe you don't. But breathing pre-efficacy

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:47.340
 exercise is generally, is, I mean, very important in Vajrayana Buddhism, because the body is,

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:57.020
 is completely like kind of occupied or body has three principles. Channel, wind and essence

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:04.380
 elements. These three, wind is what? Breathing, wind is the breathing. Breathing is wind.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:13.180
 And wind has many different wind, variety of wind, big and small. Breathing is gross, gross wind,

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:21.180
 or gross air. And what, we were talking about the thought about the mindfulness, the emotion,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:29.820
 all these things. Who really accelerating that? It's wind. The breathing, that is accelerating

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:36.380
 all the emotions. So therefore, before you do the meditative, this is the idea of you do the

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:45.900
 breathing pre-efficacy exercise. That means you're preifying the negative energies in the body

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:53.820
 that is hovering in our systems. Or in other words, maybe the inner pollutions

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:59.500
 that you're really releasing that. Inner pollutions are created by what?

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:07.260
 Emotions. Emotions. All the energies kind of, it's just really hovering. This is,

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.940
 then the emotions, they all kind of summarize all the emotions. And the Buddha said it's three

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:22.240
 portions. Ignorance, attachment, anger. That toxic, toxic air, toxic blue, that which is hovering

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:22.540
 in

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:29.260
 our brain, in our systems of body, now you're cleaning that. And so then our kind of system,

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:35.420
 the environment of the inner space become more clean, more kind of pristine. So that really will

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:44.380
 help to our meditation, our practice, to the inner touch, to call it. So that's ideas. That's the

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:51.260
 meaning of that breathing pre-efficacy exercise. When you purify, and now this is according to

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:57.260
 the teaching, again, it just of course roughly, where it grows level, but it's the right part of

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.740
 the body. Again, with this different kind of man or woman or that, but this time just to say,

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:08.940
 the right part of the body is more, has led more tenderness to have the, like the kind of

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:16.700
 anger, emotion, or related anger, anger, toxic air. And left head, little more kind of like

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:24.380
 pollutions of the attachment related air. And then generate all over is, is the inner

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:31.100
 related with that. And it just is the principle, but otherwise all has all three. It has, anger has

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:40.540
 attachment, ignorance, ignorance, attachment has anger and ignorance, and, and the ignorance has

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:47.820
 also those three, both up to attachment and anger too. But this, so when we do this, what do we do?

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.300
 Do this with holding this, and this kind of hold the breathing, and the kind of pull eye and the

00:53:54.300 --> 00:54:03.580
 body in, and put your, these thumbs, thumbs to the edge of the right fingers. According to Buddhism

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:03.580
,

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:10.380
 right finger is very special, again, channel here, nerve systems. There's emotion, right? Emotion

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:10.700
 is,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:18.300
 and, and as well as energy of the emotions, energy of the wisdom kind of flowing here, there. So

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:18.460
 when

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:23.900
 you hold the breath down, that in the way, in the conception, or in the mind, you're pressing,

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:31.820
 stopping, or blocking, that emotion is. So now gather everywhere, and then you pull in, hold,

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:38.620
 and do those movements, really, and then throw this, and put down, and that time when you exhale,

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:48.460
 mostly the anger related to toxic air, emotions, so that pollutions are went from the, from the

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:55.420
 right nostrils, nostrils. And that color is a dark kind of color, smoking kind of dark colors,

00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:02.140
 that they call it. So it's mainly anger, but it has attachment, it has ignorance. And the second

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:11.180
 time is the attachment. That is, again, a dark red color. Mainly is the attachment, and with anger,

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:19.630
 and all that pollutions went out. And the third is, is then ignorance. That comes from both nost

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.660
rils

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:27.740
 and mouth, as we do, and came in color. It's kind of dark, smoking colors, colors, and then release

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:33.580
 that. And then you repeat that again and again, and of course, gross level, subtle level, very

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:40.140
 refined level, polluted, polluted, all went out completely clear with that. So that is a brilliant

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:46.700
 meaning of the, what's called this brilliant purificic exercise. So that, and then after that,

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:52.220
 when you realize that, then you're going to now meditate with mindfulness, bring all kind of good

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:59.340
 things, joy and appreciation, really. And just joy and appreciation and compassion and thought for

00:55:59.340 --> 00:55:59.820
 all

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:05.740
 living beings, just relax for a few seconds of one minute of that, and then feel also presence of

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:05.820
 the

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:12.410
 Buddha as the enlightened beings. They meditate with us, feel presence. "Buddha, vada, bharma, samb

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.620
hava,

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:17.580
 tara," you know, all the linear masters come right in front of us. They are meditating, they are

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:25.100
 supporting us, and we are kind of in a way close with that. So they are also sending us a lot of

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:31.180
 blessings and light, and then just meditate according to your instruction or whatever you're

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:40.380
 following. So that's just, again, a reminder of our meditation. And that's it. Thank you,

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:46.380
 thank everyone. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I will do it in a short.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:57:01.100
 I'm so full of gratitude. You asked such beautiful questions, and instead of getting

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:07.900
 a fabulous answer, we received about 10 different teachings. Thank you, Kempo.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:17.660
 Thank you all for being here. We'll now just do the one paragraph of the dedication of merit on

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:23.740
 page 11, and then one more minute of meditation. Okay, thank you. Thank you again for all of us.
