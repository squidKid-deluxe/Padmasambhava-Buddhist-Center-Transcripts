00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 You heard it many times, you know 'Bhuumzi'. 'Bhuumzi' is 'joint masters' and the 'joint master' or

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.240
 in a way 'Bhuumzi' is 'ritual chariot' or ritual master. Master 'Bhuumzi'. That is 'Bhuumzi'.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:32.510
 And the third master of this meditation is 'Medala Master'. And that is a video called 'Chupu'. 'Ch

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.040
upu' or 'offering chariot' and will take care of the shrine.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.060
 Shrine in Medala, all that aspects. Because Vajrayana presided over the ceremony in a way to look

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.440
 at larger Medala aspects and perspectives.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:02.600
 And then the 'joint master' or the 'ritual master' will take care of every giant and ceremony, the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 mudra, all that we are doing. That is leading by the 'Bhuumzi'.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.160
 'Bhuumzi' is leading the giant as well as also, for example, the mudras. And as well as also 'Bhuum

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.200
zi' is leading all the ritual implements.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.360
 So that means ritual implement, what you will do in the group, always they will follow the 'Bhuumzi

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.240
'. 'Bhuumzi' will in a way, so it is in one way in a regular, I think in a Western world, 'Bhuumzi'

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.040
 is leading the conductors.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:49.080
 Conductors. That everybody follows within 'Bhuumzi'. Even that, for example, 'Vajyacharya'. 'Vajy

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.400
acharya' will follow 'Bhuumzi'.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.160
 Of course, there is specific duty for the 'Vajyacharya', for the 'Vajyacharyas', 'Majyacharyas'.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:06.450
 But generally speaking, the ceremony, the generally ceremony, 'Vajyacharyas' also will follow

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.120
 within 'Bhuumzi'.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:17.180
 That 'Bhuumzi' is the conductors. With that conductors, within that conductors, then 'Chogong' will

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.980
 perform the all-take care of the shrines, shrine duties, the mandala duties, from the offering to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 the element, to the need, and all of looking or presiding, all examining the mandala, how that is.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 From the tolma, to the offering, to the essence, and every aspect.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 But what will be prescribed by, by that chopples?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
 Then there is a big monastery that has another one, and the portwasser.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.620
 That is known as, I think, in Tibet, we call, I mean, not we call, in Tibet, it is known as 'Chutam

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.120
'.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 Chutam, and C-H-O, maybe just pronounce it here, C-R-I-M, Chutam.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 Chutam is the investment world that I think they call 'monitors'.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.100
 'Monitors' is not just a monitor, but monitor also is master of everything, in a way, knows

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.120
 everything.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 So it is like looking how everything is happening, kind of over presiding.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:43.770
 So all that medala, nishel, every aspect, looking every kind of, in a way, guidelines, as well as

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.120
 all the duties, maintaining everything, how that is happening.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:54.860
 Almost larger views of the mostly in the conduct and the surface levels, surface level, how things

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.120
 happen.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 And that is, a little bit, 'Chutam'.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:10.290
 'Chutam' is a dharma, 10 means guidelines or the moralities, and who are upkeeping the moralities

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.120
 of the dharma.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.120
 And that is 'Chutam', 'Chutam'.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.540
 So these four are generally in the big monasteries, but even in the small monasteries, maybe they

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.120
 don't need the monitors and all that.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 It is small, but this 'Dodjihokum' and 'Wumze' and 'Chokum' are always.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.120
 And then, of course, in hermitage, in just three purposes, that is not enough purpose to do.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 So then, that even the hermitage, one person in themselves becomes the 'Iborim' and everything.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 Becomes very 'Chala' and 'Chokum' and 'Wumze' and the 'Moneta' or the 'Chutam', all that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.610
 But it is kind of the 'Gikki' that vision, that goal, that frame, kind of just, even it is just one

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.120
 person, two person, three person, kind of having that.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 So because ceremony, when we do this ceremony, has many meanings that we already discussed that.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 First of all, ceremony is practice, our practice.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:30.120
 Practice means we are purifying our habitivity, negativities and revealing our innate beauty.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.120
 That is the most principle purpose.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.510
 With that contrast, then, maintaining the beautiful 'Sabaya' or the beautiful 'Vedya' states, three

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.120
 Vedas.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 And everything kind of keeping in that contrast as we talk, beauty, understanding, relaxation, bodh

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.120
icitta, yoga, devotion, graceful, gratitude and all the application.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.870
 I mean, every kind of goodness call it, most of the time it is hiding in the midst of the 'Hapaki'

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.120
 bed and now we glorify that.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.120
 We bring up that in perfect state, perfect state.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:20.120
 That is the ceremony. It is not just doing something, kind of like ritual or something like that.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:31.160
 But really we bring every goodness that hiding behind the midst of our many layers of the duality

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.120
 through the power and the techniques of the Vedayana.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:42.120
 Now we really bring up that from the bottom to the top, completely in that state.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:50.120
 Therefore, joy, appreciation and grateful, graceful.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.120
 And those, of course, everybody knows, is called very basic.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.120
 But basic is the central columns.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 And with that, then concentration, realization.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.120
 If you expand in that, world is normal world what we see now, world.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.120
 It is truly one of the beautiful world, beautiful states where we can fully enlighten.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.410
 And that's why all those great masters, great practitioners did stand in the same soil where we are

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.120
 standing now.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.120
 And breathe the same air while we are breathing.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.120
 And drink the same water. Maybe now they are more highly developed or polluted or whatever.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:43.400
 Same things. Same thing they did. Looks the same thing for poor legs or poor legs and head, no same

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.120
 thing.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.120
 But they are beautified. Pied from such these.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.120
 Those are the, like examples, raw models of us.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 Us. Then that's what this ceremony, the ritual practice is.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.120
 And we don't pick up, we don't discover these things.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.120
 Then we kind of almost monetize, disappoint it.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.120
 And kind of also blame.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.120
 That's not enough. This, that, this and that.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.120
 But that's ego-clinking. This is duality.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.120
 This is propagation.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.120
 Therefore, every single world in the Buddha, every really know, every single world is so special.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.960
 It hit the target of the natural and dispel the duality and revere our goal what we are looking for

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.120
.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:47.120
 If we value, if we appreciate, if we respect for duality, this habit pattern is so funny.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.120
 It's so, in one way, it's so stubborn. Very stubborn.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:59.120
 Strumming, and also always so dissatisfaction, satisfaction.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.120
 And that is weak wellness of ourselves.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.120
 And therefore, we restrain the joy and devotion and purity status.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.120
 Then we, we confine goal. We can really find true beauty.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.120
 What we are looking for, what we are.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.120
 And therefore, these basic things, we shouldn't ignore.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:31.120
 The joy, appreciation, respect, grateful, graceful, I think.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.120
 Gracious, gracious, gracious, gracious, gratitude.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.120
 Those are all we need.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.120
 And we have all that. We have that. We are not really lacking anything.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.120
 We have every abundance, every beautiful, everything.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.120
 And not just every abundance we have.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.120
 But we can share, we can glorify with that beauty.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.120
 We live with this beauty, with that beauty.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120
 Beauty, continually.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:09.120
 Guide throughout all the journey, and the days, and the months, and the years, and continue.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 So therefore, this is, ritual ceremony is very, very special.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.120
 And without those understanding, again, I think, we have some chokum.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.120
 This chokum will bring, now again, we will come back to the, to the Ghana chakra phase.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.120
 As I said, the chokum will hold.
