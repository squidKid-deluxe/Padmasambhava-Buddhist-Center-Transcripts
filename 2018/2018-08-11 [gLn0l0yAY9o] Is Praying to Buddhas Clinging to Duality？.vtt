00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 In some of our prayers, we are praying to Padma Samye Ling, to the Buddha, to Tara. That feels like

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 a form of duality.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 How can you explain that, in terms of that in our social teaching, we are trying to end duality?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 This too, isn't duality. This whole practice of praying is duality, definitely.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.250
 But, as a great-master, as H. Dudjom Rinpoche said, "As long as we have duality, then it's good to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 do good dualities."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.430
 Really good duality. And that is something more appealing and more kind of more beautiful and more

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.000
 practical.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 And then, according to the Buddha's teaching, I'm teaching, of course, when Padma Samye came this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.100
 old, and according to the teaching, when Padma Samye is living Buddha is not just came and gone, he

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.000
 is living Buddha.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 And then also, when Buddha came, by according to the teaching, Buddha is in Tarmakai and Samphogai,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.000
 straight as so, he is living Buddha.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 And in the Maga, I found that, kind of what we see like this home building, so that is kind of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 dissolved there, but still, he is living Buddha.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And according to the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, Tara is living, again, Buddha.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.290
 But that's how we promote the blessings of this with duality, to bless us as duality beings, and as

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.710
 well as duality beings, everyone, and to remove their obstacles, hindrance, and then just help us

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.000
 to discover our zoky nature, I mean, according to different people.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 But then, that's it, so it's good.
