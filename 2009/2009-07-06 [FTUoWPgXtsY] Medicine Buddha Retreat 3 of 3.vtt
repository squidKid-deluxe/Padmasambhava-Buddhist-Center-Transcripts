 "For me, to come to some building, and as well as all the other great false measures, all those

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.770
 great beings of that time, and that teaching is continually spreaded and continually concated with

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.060
 all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, so everyone really, the Medicine Buddha is practicing becomes

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.440
 so popular, and every, of course, this teaching lineage comes from, then, the great Master Shandala

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.000
 Chakra.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And then in the nimma teaching, also continually, that was not known as considered as all of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 transmission lineage, known as kama lineage, is continually.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.120
 In the nimma, although in the nimma teaching there is a lot of medicine Buddha text teachings, and

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.000
 that will connect with, specifically, to the Murugam Mahasambhava.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.430
 And Murugam Mahasambhava is no other than also the Buddha Chaturman himself, again, in the poem,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 the Murugam Mahasambhava.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.880
 And again, to demonstrate to the followers, Murugam Mahasambhava practiced meditative and rich

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.000
 enlightenment, even though he is himself as Buddha Chaturmani or the Buddha Amitabha.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.410
 But he practiced the medicine Buddha, known as the urban medical park in India, known as the urban

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.000
 medicine forest, medical forest, where Murugam Mahasambhava practiced it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 At that time, the 16-up, like, great healing dakinis appeared, gave the teaching to Murugam Mahas

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.000
ambhava, and Murugam Mahasambhava himself then become as inseparable as the meditative Buddha.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 And then when Murugam Mahasambhava came to bed, and he continually began to give the teachings on

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.300
 the medicine Buddha, and then known as the old medicine Buddha of Murugam Mahasambhava, known as

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.000
 the meditative Buddha of Murugam Mahasambhava.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680
 And there's many, again, he give the teaching, those teaching.
