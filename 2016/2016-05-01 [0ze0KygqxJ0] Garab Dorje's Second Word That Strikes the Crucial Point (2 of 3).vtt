00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300
 "Ta tiktodu gi" in the debate, "Ta tiktodu" and this is always difficult for me to ask like this,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:20.000
 "Ta tiktodu gi" means one decisive, decisive, decisive and confident, decisive confidence, I think,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 or decisive trust, or it is everything, it is everything, it embodies everything,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 that means raka, dharmakaya, it embodies everything, this is also in the natural level of the raka,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 dharmakaya is never deluded by the object, that means object means object of five senses,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.200
 is never deluded, cannot deluded, well not deluded by the objects, and it also cannot be deluded,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.000
 spoiled by the subjects,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.370
 it cannot be spoiled by the subjects, what means subject? Subject means mind, subject means act

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.000
 consciousness,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 what are those act consciousness? Consciousness, the eye consciousness, ear consciousness,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.690
 mouse consciousness, tongue consciousness, body consciousness, and ear consciousness, and mind

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 consciousness,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 emotional consciousness, and allied consciousness, cannot be deluded, so that means it cannot be

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 deluded by,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 or changed by object, by subject, by any means, it is always fresh, clear, unebated, natural act is

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.000
 is, that is the rupa,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.470
 therefore we should have confidence on this, confidence in this, and also same time we should have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.000
 the confidence

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 in joy, in the advocate of the richness and greatness of this rupa, discoverer rupa, we don't have

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 to be,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 what in the teachings said, we don't have to be mouth watering to the others, other instructions,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 teachings,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.540
 this and that, rupa is recognized, rupa is everything, embodies everything, it embodies all the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.000
 teachings,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.680
 every teachings is completed within this discoverer rupa, there is nothing else teaching is, there

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.000
 is, beside the rupa,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.310
 rupa is here, bodhicata is here, all path is here, all boom is here, within the rupa, everything is

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 within, everything,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.130
 so all teachings are there, and all the mademaka teachings are there, in the rupa, and all the mad

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.000
hyaparamata teachings is here,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.670
 mamadhara teachings is here, and everything is here, nothing is out of this, rupa is the ultimate

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.000
 state,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.690
 rupa is the ordinary, or zocchi is the ordinary natural state, one with discoverer, we should have

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.000
 in joy,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 deal with devotion and preserve and activate discoverers, bring out full bloom of the realization,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 how for example mademaka is here, mademaka teachings, what is mademaka?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 It shows you mademaka, in the Tibetan it is woman, what means middle, what means middle?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Free from all extremes, existing, non-existing, either and neither, that is in the rupa,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 rupa is beyond existing, non-existing, either and neither, ask yourself, is there or not?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So, whole mademaka teachings are here, whole mademaka is within the rupa,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 and then whole pandyaparamata teachings, that is the word, again, what means pandyaparamata?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.550
 Pandyaparamata is translated as the Indian, transcendent wisdom, transcendent wisdom that goes

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.000
 beyond, transcendent.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.550
 And in Tibetan, hiratya parathasamma, hiratya parathasamma, hiram is supreme knowledge, supreme

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.000
 wisdom.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.660
 So what is, when you just go out, the rupa, there is nothing more supreme wisdom than the rupa, rup

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.000
a.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 What means parathasamma, going beyond, transcendent beyond?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Beyond means going to reach the Buddhahood, enlightenment.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.830
 By practicing rupa, or by practicing zukhi, it will bring, Buddha is right here, the nirvana is

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.000
 right here,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 enlightenment is right here.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So, there it is, the ultimate state of the pandyaparamata.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And then, what is, Mahamudra, many a times in the teaching said, many a times in the teaching said,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 ground is mademaka, path is mahamudra, result is zukhi.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Teaching only said, so ground of the mademaka, I explain it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 When you discover the rupa, that is the mademaka.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Path is the mahamudra.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 What means mahamudra?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.750
 Mahamudra in the teaching said, is like a great cell, cell that, celled every day, nothing is out

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.000
 of that cell, cell, cell.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Rupa is, nothing is out of that cell, that is, rupa.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Three gaias in the rupa, and three vajas in the rupa, samsara, nirvana, the display of the rupa,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 what is outside that?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Rupa is a pervasive cell, what is the nature of the mind?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 So, therefore, whole mahamudra is complete within the, within the rupa state.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Rupa state.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Then zukhi teaching, zukhi itself, result is zukhi.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And zukhi means everything is complete.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Zukhi, great completions, everything is complete within zukhi.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Nothing is outside of the zukhi, or nothing is outside of the nature of the mind.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So, all this is in zukhi state.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 And then vows and samayas are also in zukhi state.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Everything, vows and samayas, and empowerment and all that, everything is this, this.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 The old man's empowerment is what?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.880
 And zukhi teaching said the fourth empowerment, fourth empowerment, or rupa-saraing, the powerful

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.000
 empowerment of rupa, rupa.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Discovering that rupa, nature, nature is empowerment.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.040
 When we receive the zukhi of empowerment, man, and the fourth empowerment always introduces the

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.000
 nature of the mind, or rupa.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 This is the what it is.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 So, empowerment is also complete.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Samayas are complete, vows are completed, everything is completed within these rupa states.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So, therefore, what the great master said in the teaching,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 he said we don't have to mouth water something to the others, then the zukhi, and enjoy this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Generous, enjoy stabilizing that.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 If we're lingering all the time, we've been gypsy.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 In some generally in the Buddha's teaching, sentient beings are gypsies.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 From the beginning, we are gypsy, all the time.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We are wandering all the time.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 But then also we have been spiritually gypsy.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Then we are gypsy from every ways.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 We won't get, we won't be settled.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Settled.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.490
 So, therefore, recognize the beauty and the richness and the importance and the glories of this

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.000
 nature,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 and then we begin to practice.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 We begin to activate these qualities.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.850
 So, that is what the second rule of the teaching, the garabdul-ya teaching, which is very important

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.000
.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Here, great master made...
