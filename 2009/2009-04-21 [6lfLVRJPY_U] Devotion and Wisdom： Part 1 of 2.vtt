 Master Maharajana said in one of his films, again teaching, known as "Garlan of the Precious Jew",

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.400
 this is a Madhima text.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.990
 In that text said, in order to reach the enlightenment of Buddhahood, we need two things, wisdom

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.120
 and devotion.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.080
 Wisdom and devotion, that is so important, crucial to reach the enlightenment, because with all the

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.360
 wisdom, we cannot really dispel the ignorance.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.970
 In the mind, the antidote of the ignorance is wisdom. The wisdom is so powerful that this wisdom

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.520
 will dispel the ignorance.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.880
 But even these two are so important, but then witches have to go first, and Maharajana said, first,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.040
 even these two first have to go with devotion.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.610
 Without the devotion, you won't open the eye of the wisdom's absence, and then you will be

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.080
 completely closed.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.100
 So therefore, devotion even goes first, then the wisdom. So that means, you have to activate the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
 devotion, and then put your wisdom,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.730
 which is what remains meditation, practices, and then maintain it on the uyub, like as the Dzokhin

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.080
 or the Madhyamaka uyub.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.000
 So therefore, the devotion is again, the nature of devotion is joy and appreciation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.440
 When you have the devotion, there is also joy for effort comes, so easily, and there is.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 Without that, then almost our wisdom is closed, our wisdom is sleeping.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.430
 So therefore, this devotion is again the great mass, Maharajana said, they have to go first, even

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.560
 before the wisdom.
