00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 The Buddha Kachamuni, in the teaching we read, read the God of Hope within his students,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.240
 telling his, carrying his own arms forward.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 He is not acting like I am a big teacher, I am the big Buddha, and if someone is holding

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.760
 carry his own doors, they get it. Let me teach you the simple number of his lives.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 And so that's reflected on the mind, on the spiritual life, is the personal point of the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.400
 train of the body. Even though we have this spiritual army, the spiritual opportunity,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.920
 but secondly, is it impersonal? This impersonal is an idea of knowledge,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.620
 always not just the Buddhist, the only the Buddhist, but everyone. As I say, whether you believe or

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.000
 not

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.880
 believe, we are all in a rollercoaster of the impersonal.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:37.600
 This is the spiritual life of the impersonal, and it is supreme.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.920
 During the teaching, Buddha Kachamuni said, in his seat, among all the conceptions,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 the recollectoring mind of impermanence is supreme.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 Impermanence, three impermanence, subtle impermanence, and gross impermanence.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 We are never going to see that subtle impermanence is so subtle.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.520
 So, gross impermanence, we are looking. What is the teaching of impermanence?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.120
 Representing impermanence should hold this universal, is impermanence.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.280
 Thinking of all the power of being,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.080
 representing impermanence, taking all power of being for the past.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.000
 Reflecting impermanence is thinking of all the double world in the past.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And the reflector impermanence of the variety of it, variety of the different, all different

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.320
 reasons.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:29.040
 And then the reflector impermanence is thinking of ourself, each of ourself.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.680
 So, those, many races, where reflector kind of begin to see, detecting out of that impermanence.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.160
 And the first is the collective of the whole, this universal.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.760
 That is without, for example, this recorded Buddha teaching,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.000
 this world, where we are now, is not here, always is not always here.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:10.480
 According to teaching, this little love plays like many, many eons ever.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.240
 For example, the origin of this world, according to Buddhism,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:26.000
 it has the process of this universal circle of the universe, it has any eons.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:42.240
 20 eons to build up this world, and a 20 eons to function as it is,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:54.880
 and a 20 eons to decline of this universe of this world, and a 20 eons to complete

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.440
 space state, it is a universe where we allow a cold and Buddhism in the future, one time,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.800
 in where we completely become spit, there is nothing existing.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:13.840
 The whole circle will take 20 eons, also 80 eons.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.840
 A cold and Buddhism, that is not the end of the universe.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.360
 The whole 20 eons, again, this world is formed from another universe.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:41.440
 So that is how the Buddha would take it, and then also within all the time, I have seen the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:52.480
 spring, summer, all the winter, and all that fantastic.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 Because nothing is really lost.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:07.200
 Similarly, all the beings, all the things, all the ones, even the names of the people

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.360
 can be frightened, but they are all gone.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.040
 And all the noble ones, too.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.480
 The relatives, highly relative babies, such as the strength, which is a bullet that I made.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.760
 Anything, according to Christianity, takes a crisis.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:37.040
 So far, so specific, so significant, they can change fire into the water, water into the fire,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.080
 and they can break that into life, life, all that they can do.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.400
 But yet, those are all the stories.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:03.040
