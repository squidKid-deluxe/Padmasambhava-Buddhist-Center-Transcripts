00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 "First, I think you said about the devotion, and devotion is definitely a conception. It's a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:18.170
 conception of devotion. But there is, again, as long as we have dualities, there are good dualities

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.000
 and bad dualities. And we should always do good dualities.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 What is good duality is something benefit to us, benefit for others, something bring joy and peace

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.490
 happiness to us, and joy and peace to others. That is good dualities. We should do that. We should

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.000
 work."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.390
 "And this is also not just devotion, also both each other. These are conceptions in this. Generally

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.450
, both each other has two dualities. Everything in the Buddha's teachings is two dualities, two dual

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:07.240
ities, ultimate devotions, true devotions, ultimate devotions, and absolute both each other,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.160
 relative to both each other, so-called that. But relative to both each other is also conceptions,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.000
 all this."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.010
 "But as well as also performing the marriage activities, all these conceptions, accumulated the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:27.660
 marriage and so-called this. This we need to do until we go beyond the dualities. Until we went

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.000
 beyond the dualities."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 "For that reason, the great Master, the Lord, I said to Naropa, son, until you got the realization

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 of the unborn, don't give up the two merits. Don't give up two merits."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.370
 "The reality level, what is two merits? It's the dualities. The reality level is dualities. The

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:07.730
 duality is dualities. And nature is beyond the dualities. It's all that, natural status. But this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:16.600
 devotion is, again, of course, another good duality. This duality will lead us to beyond dualities

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.000
."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.460
 "This is like, as always said, homopedic medicines. Homopedic duality will take care of the other

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.000
 dualities."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.550
 "So this devotion and all this will take care of the un-not good dualities. And that's why also

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:45.580
 when the teaching said, as, as, in the teaching said, as, as iron will cut iron, as iron will stop

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.000
 the iron, duality will stop the duality."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.550
 "That's the teaching said, that too. So this is using that technique, well, brain, that realization

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.000
."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.530
 "And now for that, again, say that when we do the devotion, it's using objects. But this time, for

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.000
 example, devotion, what, how we do?"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.020
 "This isn't it, we practice every day." "That we regulate Buddha, Gautam Mahasamma, in the poem of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.000
 'Ordi Dordi' in the teaching said, which is embodiment of all the lineage masters."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.210
 "Embodiment of all the Buddhas come one single state as 'Ordi Dordi' right in front of us, and that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.000
 is object of our devotions."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.150
 "To that object, we feel tremendous joy, tremendous appreciation, and tremendous love, longing,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.000
 longing thought, thought without any doubt and hesitations."

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 "And now, what we let to be? We let to be exactly that dharmakaya, that vedadara, dharmakaya vedad

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:03.000
ara, sambhokaya vedadara, namakaya vedadara, and that, that's what we like to become."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.050
 "And stand giant, giant is the call of devotion, giant is the call of joy, giant is the call of

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:20.000
 love, giant is the call of appreciation, giant is the call of free from the doubt and hesitation."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.110
 "And as a day, skeptical, we like to open ourselves, we like to be that, we like to be as it is, we

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.840
 like to become vedasamana vedadara, with that, only, failing thought, and then, giant, and pray,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.000
 and bless it, and finally, where that worked, and then, merge it back to your nature of the mind."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.520
 "And then relax, relax, and this is what in the teaching said, devotion is so important, and for

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.810
 those reasons, always in the teaching said, said, in the practice of lineage, and in Yuma and Akkad

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.370
u, everyone said that when you have the, if you like to get the realization, devotion is really

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.000
 important, not just only that Akkadu, but the Buddha said, again and again, again and again."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.290
 "In Buddha said, in the Pāṇḍa Pāṇḍa of other teaching, O Shāri Pottara, if you like to

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.000
 get the realization, be devoted."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.130
 "Even Buddha said, devotion is a door to get the realization, or door to get the realization of

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.000
 absolute truth."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.100
 "So therefore, devotion is really important, and the teaching said always, again and again, again

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.000
 and again, and then along with both each other, along with that."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.660
 "But generally, when you get the realization, realization devotion is there, your own appreciation

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.000
."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.500
 And what that great master, again, what great master, the Kithiramoyu always said that, "Great

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.640
 Master Malarepa said to this great, his disciple, one of the great disciples, 'Gambhava, when they

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.000
're departing, finally departing, departing.'"

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.070
 And what the Gambhava asked to Malarepa, "When I should start helping to the other beings, or begin

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.000
 to teaching to the others, when I should do that?"

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.050
 This great master Malarepa said, "Son, when you have seen Pāda as living Buddha, that's the time

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.000
 you should start teaching."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.870
 That also means devotion. When you have that state of that, then you have the realization perfectly

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.000
 as it is.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 So this, of course, is a conception there. But however, this conception is nothing else.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 We're talking the display of Dhānakāya. When you get the realization, conception is nothing bad.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.890
 The concept is a part of the display. But the Kṛṣṇa being clean, that is the interfering of

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.000
 that qualities.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 So that is Kṛṣṇa's about, I think, devotion, hopefully that.
