00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.100
 Thank you. >> Good afternoon. I'm going to go over very briefly about the teaching of the CHAPJI

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:27.950
 video machine. And we are here in the point line. So that's what we've been doing for the last

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.000
 three days.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And we've been discussing...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.240
 We've been discussing, of course, the greatest teachers, the Buddha Chaitanya is teaching. We've

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 been discussing about how we put teaching into the practice and that can benefit ourselves for

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.000
 taking the advantage of our very beautiful present lives.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 So that's what we've been doing on the teaching. That is what it is. The Hissons of the universe

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690
 said that here, those people would like to really transform the samsara, the samsara, into the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:41.000
 state of the great pure land or the enlightenment stages, how we should follow that asset.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.740
 So then we lay out that when we put time to the practices, that can be summarized in the two

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 sections. Post-meditation and meditation status.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.510
 Post-meditation status or post-practice status, we should always have... Where there is post-med

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:09.000
itation or the meditation state or practice status, we should always have beautiful motivations.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.370
 The motivation is the foundation of the practices. And not just only that, according to Buddhism,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.000
 the mind is the ground foundation of everything. Everything. Everything starts from the mind.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.370
 There's nothing really is developed or started without the mind. And so therefore, mind has many

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.510
 different thoughts and conceptions, but good motivations, correct motivations, positive motivations

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.000
.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.500
 What that is, positive motivations, of course, you all know. Joy and appreciation both each other

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.000
 in the purity and understanding of the way things are on the reality level.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.200
 Not duality level, but the reality level. All beyond duality, how these things are all, all and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.000
 everything is.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.070
 Kind of reflecting those thoughts very much. And so nowadays, joy and appreciation are opposite of

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.000
 the deep present.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.260
 Anxiety and worries, all that things, those kind of unhealthy mental status and then sadness. All

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.000
 that we kind of bring up in the mental status and completely occupy our mind.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.250
 Mind with all these kind of unhealthy motivations, that really is not going to help anyone. And

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.000
 therefore, we have to change that motivation.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.090
 How we will bring joy and appreciation, and we really experience a lot of difficult troubles,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.000
 particularly such as this time, there's so many kind of challenges going on.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.270
 Is it true? It's difficult to have joy and appreciation many times, but we have to think more

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.000
 realistic, more like sensibles with common sense.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.790
 Now, this situation, what we are facing now is not just only us. The whole world looks like really

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.000
 going on there, going.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.560
 And everyone is talking, they have to be isolated and as well as watch hands and wear the mask and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.000
 so forth, every instruction is saying that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.700
 For maybe those all we can do, particularly this country or the development countries, but those

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.050
 who are really not developed, all countries, they cannot even, they need to do, they cannot do all

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.000
 those things, what we can do here.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.420
 So at least at that level, how much will you have a good advantage that we can take care of

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.000
 ourselves, follow the instructions, that is not just also coincidental.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.660
 Truly we have the visual cause and conditions, what are those situations that are kind of like

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.520
 surrendering to us, really feel happy and joy with that, even though we are going all these myths

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.670
 of the challenge and the difficulty, but we have some, we can take care of that and we really

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.000
 follow the instructions.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 We can do every best to prevent those situations and overcome that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.130
 And that is what is all that. And then for us, we have what I said yesterday and you all know, we

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.810
 have the beautiful situation as women lives, that is also not really kind of casual and

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.000
 insignificant, we have beautiful life.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.060
 Then for us, we have the freedom that we do life, but ten luxuries. And we put all those five lux

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.450
uries that are related with others, five luxuries that are related with their own self, we put

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:01.000
 together those, we have the 18 luxuries of all 18 endowments, ten luxuries.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.700
 And that means spiritual, we are really well convicted of the wealthy individuals, maybe material

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:16.890
 level, maybe we don't have everything, but spiritual level, really we are quite wealthy, which is

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.000
 wonderful and beautiful.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.970
 According to many great masters and expertise, smart ones who say, material wealth will not last

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.740
 forever. Even you do everything, every effort of trying to keep up these and that things won't last

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.000
, but when you develop the spiritual, the Dharma wealth in your heart and mind, that goes on and on.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.490
 Not just only on this lifetime, every belief, future lives or heaven, it will go all the way to the

00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:01.270
 heavens, future lives. So it is so rewarding to have the spiritual wealth that all start with

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.000
 beautiful motivation, joy and appreciation.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.610
 Lighten our mind and heart with joy and combine with courage and commitment. That's how we overcome

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.000
 all the troubles.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.320
 Read books of the life story of those 18 great masters, Bodhisattvas. What means Bodhisattvas? They

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.000
 are known as warriors.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.720
 They are conqueror of the troubles and difficulties, negative emotions of samsara and bring the joy

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.480
 and peace, happiness, turned environment, their perception and their conception into the violent

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.000
 states.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.500
 That's what in Buddhism known as warriors, truly they will conquer the negative beliefs and trouble

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.990
makers and dualities and ego clings and become one of the beautiful beings in the world, so calm, so

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:07.000
 faithful, so simple, yet so concerning and so thoughtful and respectful to every living being.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.310
 Thou doth art, naught on as great Bodhisattvas. So this all, every able to maintain that, that is

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.080
 like as I said, the motivation is the ground of whether we are practicing or whether we are a post-

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.000
practice status, is key, essential.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.780
 That is what always the teaching says and you all know. We all know that. So in a way, we are

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.000
 reminded to each other.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Now, we will put in the practice there, particularly in the practice, always in the teaching said,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.210
 it's very beautiful and very special to reflect the poor, renowned, second thoughts, poor, renowned

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.000
, second thought or point that will change the mind.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And I went first one, presuming lives, act freedoms, 10 luxuries, those I already just mentioned

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 and you all know that I went kind of really all that.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.660
 That is so special. We should be happy in joy, but the same time have the courage and commitment,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.000
 confidence that I'm going to use that better purposes.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.800
 What that means, better purpose, to benefit one's own self, benefit to others, benefit all other

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.000
 beings, according my best capabilities.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.250
 If we are able to do that, if we have that intention, attitude, thought and put that in action

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:36.700
 according our capabilities and readiness of others, then we follow in the footsteps of the

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.000
 enlightened.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.080
 And so that is the practice of lives. Second is, second of the poor, renowned sessions, the imper

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.000
manent, impermanent, reflecting mind on impermanent.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 This is also essence of the mindfulness. Personally and time, we don't see the impermanent.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.070
 Permanent, impermanent is a kind of skipping way, where we don't notice because our mind is so

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.000
 gross, looking something completely different.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 We don't really look carefully to the reality where things are happening.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:28.480
 But impermanent is part of our lives. Part of this universe, part of the world is nothing in any

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.000
 kind of unusual or special or kind of bad things.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 That's the part of the game, part of the show, part of the display we go, impermanent.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 So therefore, reflecting that impermanent is supreme mindfulness.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Isn't it mindfulness? You see, we are truly things now. And it's changing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.740
 There is a trip impermanent in the Buddha's teaching mission, gross impermanent and very subtle

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.000
 impermanent.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.100
 Gross impermanent, occasionally we kind of notice that. That we can't notice, even though maybe we

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.000
 don't really pay attention to that.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 But we can now notice. But subtle impermanent, we won't notice. It's so subtle.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.880
 What that means, subtle, that instantly is changing. Everything is changing instantly and there is

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.000
 even not stopping one second or one fraction of seconds.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.860
 Stop is changing all the time, continually changing. That is known as subtle impermanent or instant

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.000
 impermanent sometimes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Because of that, gross change is happening. For example, when you have a clock, watch.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.080
 Hour is not just coming by itself. Second is happening every second. Second is changing to the

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.000
 minute.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Minute to then, then hours come. That's how really things are happening.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.960
 From the small stage, it's changing. So therefore, luckily the impermanent is in the Buddha's

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.000
 teaching.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 The gracious, kindness, wise teacher said, "It's a supreme knowledge."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 When you have that thought, what it will bring, if you have kind of clearly thought of impermanent,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 it will bring our mind more sensible, more practical.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 And we will use our time with good purpose. That means we are not going to waste our time.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.040
 Many times, we waste our time. That means without any improvement or benefit to ourselves or one's

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.000
 own self to the others.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Really, that happens so many times. Just kind of casually just running away.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Life is running away as a roller coaster. We don't notice this. This is true.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 It's not just the Buddha said, the other great Master said.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 When we look carefully, kind of sit down on the floor or sit down on the cushion or the chair,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 reflecting inwardly, how much things have changed in our lives. How many things have happened?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.950
 But still it's continuing. It happened in the past. It is happening now. It will happen in the

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.000
 future.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And for that reason, in our teachings, on the practice and lineage,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 all principles, how we are going to reflect the impermanent more kind of precisely, more carefully.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.380
 Reflecting the impermanent of the universe, reflecting the impermanent of the inhabitants of the

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.000
 universe.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Reflecting the impermanent of the old noble beings.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Reflecting the impermanent of those great powerful ones.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And reflecting the impermanent in variety levels, ways to reflect this.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 And reflecting the impermanent meant our own lives.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 And kind of strongly reflecting the mind of the impermanent as much as we can.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Kind of very strongly, kind of very carefully reflecting those.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Those are the different, reflecting the impermanent, different method, layout of the great Masters.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.390
 If we think of the universe, we think always that the universe is so big, so jagged, so solid, so

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.000
 stable.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 It cannot happen anything. It's not true. According to Buddhism.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Once upon a time, this universe of the world where we are now is not here.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 All came, gradually.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Those to come is also known as eons. Eons, it takes.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It has a period of the completely empty spaces where this our world is now.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 That being according to Buddhism for 20 eons.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Then process and develop in this universe once there is empty space.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Develop in this, take 20 eons.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Now, then there is 20 eons will stay full function of the universe as it is now.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Then 20 eons will go decline of this universe, go finished, go into process of the finishing.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.610
 Again, then what will become at this place where the world is completely become empty, empty spaces

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.000
.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.250
 This process of changing is happening all the time. Changing on the universal level of the world

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.000
 levels.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 There is nothing that really lasts forever. Everything is changing.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Everything is moving. Everything is running in a way.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 That's how this universe is. It's true statement.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.470
 It's not just making stories, exaggeration or kind of new phenomenon trying to develop our mental

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.000
 state.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 That is the evidence you look at.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Then we started thinking the inhabitants of this universe.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Inhabitals who live in this world, how many things are changed in this world?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Look and read the history of that.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.940
 For example, each and all those civilizations, such as I heard the Atlantic, kind of great

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.000
 civilization in the Atlantic, disappeared.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 There is only kind of building history or guessing stories.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Then there is the history of this continent or this west continent.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.950
 There is called the Inghasi, something so powerful, so organized, so strong. Also building becomes

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.000
 history.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 There are so many of those great civilizations, great histories.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.250
 One after another, the souls, like when you read those histories, look so powerful, so majestic, so

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.000
 stable, all that.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 But all those gone on the side, only in the memories.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Then we read stories of even a hundred years ago.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 How many things are changed?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 How many? Is all that?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:10.300
 It's known as reflecting the impermanent to the inhabitants of beings, kind of a general level, how

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.000
 that all happens.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 The animals go pacifically to reflect the impermanent to the holy beings, the great beings,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.290
 who are known as such high-speed level realization achievements in the Buddhism of our greatest

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.000
 teacher,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Buddha Shakyamalu, who is highest realization we achieved.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 But also even himself is, in a way, gone.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 All those great arharas, Mahasadas, they can transform water into the fire,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 finally into the water, walking in the sky, sitting in the sky, sleeping, laid down in the sky,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 and performing activity in the sky, going through the wall of the mountains.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.950
 And that great beings, that who can transform and change things, but then also, only become

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.000
 historians.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Only maybe we can see some evidences, some signs, this and that now, some monuments.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Or say, "Oh, this is what this great master in life beings did, this and that. That is monument."

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 This becomes an object of interaction, or object of the primitive sport.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And then in a non-fiction school, there are so many great beings.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 These sages, in the Hindu sense, they do similar things. Great beings also are historians.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And in the greater kachyanas, such as the sons of God, all those great sages, saints,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 they can do so many great things, one after another, but they are also gone on the sides.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 So why does that happen? Why is this? This is known as impermanence.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 There is nothing that lasts forever, as it is.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 It is always changing, always changing, shifting, shifting, always.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Then you are now reflecting to a more individual level, a personal level.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 How much each of us went through, see the changes in our own lifetimes, or our own self?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 For example, for once upon a time, we are small, but impenuous.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 The mother or the parent can held in us, complete our body in their palms or hands.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Now, what will happen? Until now, since we have the memories,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 until now, how many things have changed?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 How many of them went through, one after another?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 This is not something that we planned, we desired, we wished to have.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 You know, that happened. We don't take any choices, without any blockages.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And for ourselves, we change. Every day, ourselves changes.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 For example, this morning, now, this evening, and it is continuing.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It is continuing. Same thing.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And therefore, for that reason, what are the greatest kindness,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 ambiguity, what I have come and said?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 But even though the impermanence is old, that kind of looks like changing,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 but if we use that time, we can make something beautiful development,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 because of the environment. We can take full advantage.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 What does the great master, his whole of the universe, say?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Take advantage of these lives.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Advantage is, nobody is controlling us.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Since we have add freedoms and ten lectures, we can use this time, our self,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 use the time wisely, do something good, that is related with our mind,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 our spiritual qualities, that we will love in our mental states.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Or whatever we do, mentally activities, or positive activities, whatever we do,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 it will not go into that energy that marries, not just finish it, go on.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 It will stay in our mental states.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Where it will stay in the mental state, like bank of the space, mental space,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 B-A-N-K, bank, bank of the mental spaces,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 or in the teachings in the subconscious storehouse.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 It will be registered, saved, everything there.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It will always shine, reflecting that whenever the right time comes.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 That is. So therefore, this reflecting in our mind is so important

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 because it is realistic. It is true.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 We are trying to ignore that. We are fooling our self.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 It is fooling our self. We are hiding, we completely can't really put blind covers,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 our eye, and trying to not look that.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Maybe it is just a kind of whether you won't see that for time,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 because of blind covers. But that is not going to help to anything.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 For that reason, reflecting in one's mind is supreme mindfulness.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 It brings more knowledge, more understanding,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 and we have the courage and the commitment, the confidence,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 then use the time to maximize something, beautiful things,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 to benefit our self and to the other beings.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 That is what is known as the impermanent, impermanent, impermanent,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 and that is the second point of the renunciation,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 or second point that will change the mind.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And again, what that means, what I am saying, that changed the mind.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 This poor renunciation, or this poor mind, we reflect each of that.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 That will change our mind, such grasping, clinging,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 and that attitude of the samsara, or this world we are.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 We become more, as I said already, we become more calmer,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 more peaceful, more gentle, more respectful, more sensible,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 and with a full, our common sense.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 That means we are really having good mindfulness.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 When we don't have the mindfulness, alertness,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 then those all kind of carried by the pulse of the self-important

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 and the ego clings.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Then, can we end up with many difficult troubles,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 that we kiss maybe many times on our own creations.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 So therefore, it is so beautiful and so spiritual,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 and we keep reflecting those thoughts.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Then, it really will bring all the advantages

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 of these beautiful lives, precious lives.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And that is my brief talk for today.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And be with us, and thank you.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Now we do again short meditation.
