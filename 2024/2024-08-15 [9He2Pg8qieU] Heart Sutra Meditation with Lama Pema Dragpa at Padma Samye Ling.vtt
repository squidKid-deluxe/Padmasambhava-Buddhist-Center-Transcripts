NOTE     "synopsis": "\u201cI bow to Prajnaparamita, the Wisdom Gone Beyond!\n\nThese days, throughout the world and especially in this powerful nation of America, it is common to see developments in the fields of science that are increasing our general understanding of how matter exists and functions from an external point of view. The scientists doing this research deserve continuous praise for their analyses of various aspects of reality; regardless of whether or not they believe in the Buddha, their work has confirmed many aspects of his teaching. However, science alone has not shown that it is capable of dispelling suffering or producing blissful experiences in any ultimate way.\n\nTo achieve ultimate results, we need to look inward to the vast and exceedingly profound mind itself, and discover its mode of being. Since this is not easily done\u2014in fact, it is extremely difficult\u2014one generally needs to find and follow a flawless path. The Prajnaparamita is just such a path. By steadily relying on its perfect view, it is possible to dispel all suffering and produce untold benefit and happiness for both self and others, as did countless scholar-practitioners who appeared and were witnessed in ancient India and Tibet. The view they attained is like the sky, free from conceptual extremes; it is like the sun, clearing away the dark clouds of ignorance; and it is like the moon, emitting cool rays of calm and bliss.\u201d\n\n--Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\n\nTo learn more about the Heart Sutra:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/chiso/books-by-khenpo-rinpoches/ceaseless-echoes-of-the-great-silence\n\nTo buy the sadhana prayer book:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/chiso/dharma-samudra-prayer-books/buddha-sadhana-by-mipham-rinpoche-extended",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.020
 Tashalay, warm greetings, friends. Warm greetings. This is a Heart Sutra practice. As we've been

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.720
 doing, we'll begin with a seven-line prayer, Garubache, followed by prayer, Salamas of the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 lineage that's in the PBC daily prayer, Sadhana. I'll go from now, 7.30 to 7.45 to 8.30. Thanks,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:01:01.120
 everyone. Thank you.

 Precious teacher, essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, please consider me.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.160
 Please bless me so that my mind will mature and be liberated.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 Please bless me so that the extraordinary realization of the profound path will arise in my being.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.710
 Please bless me so that I may actualize in this life the supreme path of the clear light, great

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.160
 perfection.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 Precious teacher, essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, please consider me.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.160
 Please bless me so that my mind will mature and be liberated.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:30.160
 Please bless me so that the extraordinary realization of the profound path will arise in my being.

 Please bless me so that I may actualize in this life the supreme path of the clear light, great

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.160

 Please bless me so that the extraordinary realization of the profound path will arise in my being.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:09.160
 Continue on the next page, 49.1, "The Seven Points of Mind Training of Great Master Vimalamitra."

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:23.160
 We'll recite each line slowly and then pause for a brief meditation.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:41.160
 All compounded things are impermanent like a water bubble.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:22.160
 (Pause)

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:49.160
 (Pause)

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 All the pleasures of samsara are ultimately suffering.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.160
 Though they appear comforting, they are like a ripening, poisonous fruit.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:48.160
 (Pause)

00:17:48.160 --> 00:18:17.160
 (Pause)

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:46.160
 (Pause)

00:18:46.160 --> 00:19:07.160
 (Pause)

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 The time will never come when everything is finished the way you want it.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.160
 It is like pursuing a mirage for water.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:20:12.160
 (Pause)

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 (Pause)

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:55.160
 (Pause)

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:03.300
 In all their aspects, all the samsaric activities of this life are unreliable. They resemble a

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.160
 single night's good and bad dreams.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:54.160
 (Pause)

00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:23.160
 (Pause)

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:52.160
 (Pause)

00:22:52.160 --> 00:23:12.160
 (Pause)

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:20.980
 The result of supreme liberation will never revert to suffering like a person who has been cured of

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.160
 cholera.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:24:11.160
 (Pause)

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 (Pause)

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:51.160
 (Pause)

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:59.980
 The instructions of a qualified lama are the way to climb up to the mansion of liberation. They are

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.160
 like an excellent staircase.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:32.160
 (Pause)

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:58.160
 (Pause)

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:08.160
 Thought-free meditation is the basis for all types of samadhi. It is like a well-prepared field.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:57.160
 (Pause)

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 (Pause)

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:27.160
 Now we'll recite the heart sutra. In the extended bodhisattva, it's page 1990. The heart sutra.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:28:12.160
 (Pause)

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 (Pause)

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:45.160
 Inconceivable, inexpressible, prajna-pairamitta, unborn, unceasing by nature like the sky,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:52.640
 experienced by self-reflexive awarenesses discerning pristine cognition, mother of the victorious

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.160
 ones of the three times, I make a bayousence to you.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:08.160
 Bhagavati prajna-pairamitta, riddhaya chomdendema, svaramchiparo, two-chimpaining poems.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:17.370
 Amich to the Bhagavati prajna-pairamitta, thus I have heard once the blessed one was dwelling in

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:26.430
 Rajagriha at Vulture Peak Mountain, too, through with the great gathering of the Sangha of monks,

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.160
 and the Gahabodhisattvas at that time.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:39.720
 The blessed one entered the subdhi that examines a dharma's call, profound illumination at the time

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.160
.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:51.820
 Noble avallokiteshvara the bodhisattva, asavva contemplating the profound practice of the jamparam

00:29:51.820 --> 00:30:00.160
itas, all the five skandhas to be D and nature, then through the power of the Buddha Venerable.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:09.920
 Rivutra said this to Noble Avallokiteshvara the bodhisattva, Mahasattva, how should a son or

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:20.050
 daughter of Noble, the tease who wishes to practice the profound Vrajna-ramitatraina, dressed in

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.160
 this way, Noble Ava.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:33.940
 Nada bodhisattva, Mahasattva replied to Noble Shari putra, O Shari putra, how son or daughter of

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:43.820
 Full qualities who wishes to practice the profound Shnaparamitta should regard things in the lowing

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.160
 way.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:52.400
 The five skandhas should be seen to be completely empty. Nature form is emptiness, emptiness is

00:30:52.400 --> 00:31:00.670
 form, form is nana, then emptiness, emptiness is nana, other than form in this same feeling,

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.160
 perception, mental formation and consciousness.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:14.510
 Ramthi the Shari putra, Haraldharma's emptiness they, no characteristics they are unborn and unce

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:24.340
asing neither impure nor from impurity they neither decrease nor increase their Shari putra,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.160
 emptiness has no form, no feeling, no birth.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:36.510
 Shin no mental formations, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, no tongue, no body, no mind, no

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:45.230
 appearance, no smell, no taste, no touch, no dharma, no wai, element, no dellament and no mind,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:53.970
 consciousness, element, no nur and snow, end of ignorance, no old age, death and no end of old age,

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.160
 and death like wise there is no.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:06.940
 Purring no origin of suffering, no cessation of, purring no path, no wisdom, no attainment and no,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:15.160
 no attainment therefore Shari putra since 40 suffers have thing to attain they abide in.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:25.290
 Lions upon Prajnaparamita without obscure, shins of mind they have no fear completely transcending,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:35.890
 views a go to the ultimate of nirvana, all the does of the three times by relying on the Shaparam

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:42.160
ita, awaking completely to the picked unsurpassable enlightenment.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:51.590
 And therefore the mantra Prajnaparamita is a mantra of great awareness, it beyond surpass mantra,

00:32:51.590 --> 00:33:02.190
 the mantra that sees whatever is unequal and the mantra that totally pacifies all sufferings

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.160
 incident, deceive it should be known as truth.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:18.370
 Prajnamramita mantra is attudasteyattahum gatte gatte paragatte rasam gatte bodhiso ashari putra it

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:26.160
 is in this way, bodhisattva mahasattva should train in the profound prajnam.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:36.450
 Paramita then the blessed wanna rose from that samadhi and the noble avallokitesh parada bodhisatt

00:33:51.160 --> 00:34:00.080
 And all the tathagatas will rejoice when the blessed one spoke these words then, bhushari putra and

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:09.960

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.160
 Continuing where we left off.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:19.020
 Namo amich to the Lama, amich to the Buddha, amich to the Dharma, amich to the Sangha, amich to the

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.160
 great Mother, Prashna, Paramitta.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.160
 May these words of ours come true.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.290
 Just as long ago the King of the Gods Indra, by the power and strength of contemplating the

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.160
 profound meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.160
 and reciting its words, was able to avert all demonic forces of negativity and obstacles.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:42.760
 So in the very same way, may we too, through the power and strength of contemplating the profound

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.160
 meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:52.160
 and reciting its words, all the negative influences, may they be averted, may they be annihilated,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.160
 may they be pacified.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:03.160
 Namo amich to the Lama, amich to the Buddha, amich to the Dharma, amich to the Sangha,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.160
 amich to the great Mother, Prashna, Paramitta.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.160
 May these words of ours come true.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.530
 Just as long ago the King of the Gods Indra, by the power and strength of contemplating the

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.160
 profound meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:23.160
 and reciting its words, was able to avert all demonic forces of negativity and obstacles.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.900
 So in the very same way, may we too, through the power and strength of contemplating the profound

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.160
 meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:37.160
 and reciting its words, all the negative influences, may they be averted, may they be annihilated,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.160
 may they be pacified.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:49.160
 Namo amich to the Lama, amich to the Buddha, amich to the Dharma, amich to the Sangha,

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.160
 amich to the great Mother, Prashna, Paramitta.

 May these words of ours come true.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.320
 Just as long ago the King of the Gods Indra, by the power and strength of contemplating the

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.160
 profound meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.160
 and reciting its words, was able to avert all demonic forces of negativity and obstacles.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.760
 So in the very same way, may we too, through the power and strength of contemplating the profound

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.160
 meaning of the Prashna, Paramitta,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:23.160
 and reciting its words, all the negative influences, may they be averted, may they be annihilated,

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.160
 may they be pacified,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.160
 may they be completely pacified.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:35.000
 Everything that arises interdependently is unceasing and unborn, neither non-existent nor

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.160
 everlasting, neither coming nor going,

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.160
 neither several in meaning nor with a single meaning.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.160
 All concepts and duality are pacified. To this teaching, the words of the fully enlightened Buddha,

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.160
 we pay homage on the path of attaining complete enlightenment.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:59.370
 May all obstacles, both outer and inner, to our attaining complete enlightenment be totally pac

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.160
ified.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:08.160
 Brief silent meditation.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160
 [Silence]

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.160

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.160
 [Silence]

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:53.160
 Dedication to merit.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:00.320
 Beginning with the additional prayers we've been doing, followed by page 32 in the BBC Daily Prayer

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.160
 Sadhana.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:11.160
 [Silence]

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:37.160

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:41.160
 [Silence]

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:47.160
 By this merit, may all obtain omniscience. May it defeat the enemy wrongdoing.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.560
 From the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death, from the ocean of samsara, may I free

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.160
 all beings.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.160
 May the soul source of benefit and happiness, the Buddha's teachings remain for a long time.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.900
 And may the victory banner of the lives of the noble ones, the holders of the teachings remain firm

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.160
.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:12.160
 May all the temples and monasteries, all the readings and recitations of Dharma flourish.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.160
 May the sangha always be in harmony, and may our aspirations be achieved.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:23.160
 The soul remedy for the suffering of sentient beings, the source of every joyous, the teaching.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.160
 May it remain honourably upheld and flourish for a long time.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.160
 May all the numberless beings who are sick be quickly freed from sickness.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.160
 May all the afflictions of sentient beings never again arise.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.160
 May all sentient beings always be joyful.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.160
 May all births into the lower realms cease forever.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.160
 May the wishes of all the bodhisattvas and all the bhoomis swiftly reach fruition.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.980
 At this very moment, for the peoples and nations of the earth, may not even the names, disease,

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.160
 famine, war, and suffering be heard.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:01.160
 But rather, may pure conduct, merit, wealth, and prosperity increase.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.160
 And may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.160
 The precious bodhicitta in those without it may it be generated.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.160
 And those who have it may it never diminish, but always continue increasing.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:21.290
 Throughout the succession of lives into which I shall be born, may I obtain the seven qualities of

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.160
 the upper realms of existence.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:29.160
 May I meet the Dharma immediately after taking birth and have the freedom to practice accordingly.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:35.330
 May I please the holy lamas and practice Dharma day and night by understanding the Dharma and

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.160
 practicing its inmost essence.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.160
 In that life, may I cross the ocean of samsara.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.160
 In samsara, may I expound the excellent holy doctrine.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.160
 May I not become bored and tired of accomplishing the benefit of others.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.160
 By my own tremendous impartial service to others, may everyone attain Buddhahood together.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.160
 May the lotus feet of the guru who glorifies the teachings be firm.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.160
 May the noble ones who hold the teachings encompass the earth.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.160
 May the prosperity and dominion of the patrons of the teachings increase.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.160
 And may the teachings auspiciously remain for a long time.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:16.160
 May the secret treasures of all the victorious ones, their incomparably supreme teachings,

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.160
 arise as the sun and the sky, gloriously pervading the entire universe.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.160
 Nectar essence of all the teachings of the victorious one.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.160
 Great charioteer of the secret Vatriyana teachings of the early translation school.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.160
 Emanation of nubchen sanjayeshe.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.160
 Great tertan sasum lingpa.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.160
 May your profound treasure pervade the entire world.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:45.160
 May the soul swift path of all the Buddhas, the supreme vehicle, the great perfection,

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.160
 unanimously praised by all the victorious ones.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:54.160
 The early translation school tradition of the king of the victorious ones, Padma sambhava.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.160
 The conqueror's doctrine pervade auspiciously throughout all directions.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:04.160
 May the great tradition of kempo shankarakshita, lopon, padma, sambhava,

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.160
 and dharma king, tritsandetsan, increase and spread throughout the three realm world.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:14.160
 May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind streams of beings remain inseparable

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.160
 and bring sublime well-being throughout the three times.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.160
 Deity, mantra, and dharma kaya are the nature of appearance, sound, and awareness.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.160
 The pervasive kaya and wisdom display of the Buddhas,

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:33.160
 may practitioners of the profound and secret great perfection remain inseparable

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.160
 from the innermost one-taste awareness of wisdom mind.
