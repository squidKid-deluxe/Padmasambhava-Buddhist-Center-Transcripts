00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420
 The Dzogchen View of Padma Samye Ling Monastery and Retreat Center on April 4, 2008.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 And for that reason, again, these whole things are kind of used by the future Buddha Maitri,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.640
 a used very beautiful metaphor, a metaphor in his teachings. And here he said, for example,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 when you are sick, one person is sick, sick, and now he is having difficulties, and he is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.120
 in pain. Then he went to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed that, and then the doctor found

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:34.200
 out exactly what the sickness is. And therefore, the doctor kind of diagnosed it, discovered

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 exactly the reason or the cause of this pain and that sickness. And so now when you see

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.360
 the pain as pain, and then you find out, oh, what is the cause of this pain? And that is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 the like knowledge that which you really you need or that order to treat that sickness,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:18.560
 you have to know what the cause of that sickness is. And then now, and once you have your diagnosis

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 that well, or perfectly, and then doctor give the also exactly the medicine. Medicine, not

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.720
 wrong medicine, not like higher dosage, not low dosage, but exactly as needed, give dosage,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:46.880
 and taking that dosage or that medicine, that is the same as like then the practicing or

00:02:46.880 --> 00:03:07.440
 that is part. And so now, the sickness is like suffering truth. Knowing the cause of

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 that, the doctor diagnosed that, and the cause of that sickness and knowing that is the cause

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.040
 of suffering truth. By that, doctor give the medicine and you're taking that dosage and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 that is like part truth. As you're taking the medicine, as you are now getting better

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 and better, and then finally, you're completely cured from that disease and that is the second

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:57.080
 truth. And when we cure that disease, what we become? We didn't become the different

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:08.280
 person, but only we cured the disease. That disease is unnatural. Unnatural is disturbing

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.440
 to natural systems. Systems. Systems, through the expertise of the doctor, we tell the medicine

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:27.600
 that medicine balance us back to the where we are used to be. And that is the second

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:50.240
 truth. And so that is the one. The practice is like medicines, medicines, and we are removing

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.920
 the unnatural things and then discovering what we are. And that is then the Buddha. That's

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.320
 what always in the Dzogki teaching or the Vayayana teaching, often mentioned liberated

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.960
 to the original status. The original state is a natural status. We are now a deluded

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.920
 status by all the duality minds. When deluded duality mind, this publication of the delusion

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.200
 status liberated to the original status, then we discover what true we are or what very

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:45.960
 natural we belong to.
