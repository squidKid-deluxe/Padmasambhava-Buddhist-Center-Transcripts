00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 "Again, this is one of the few today we may have to read your wonderland, especially all of you,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 and it truly is beautiful, every aspect nothing really good, and so we stand in our beautiful

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 motivation of the you and the appreciation. At the same time, the motivation of the vastness,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 the motivation of the whole each other. And then, beauty and honesty. Beauty and honesty get really

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 punished, what I've said so many times, and known as the pre-medial states, pre-medial states.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 According to the Aniruddhi Dzogchen teaching, it's called "three kayas" - dharmakaya, sambhogakaya,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 nirmanakaya - everything is in three kayas states, that makes sense. But if you can elaborate

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 on that a little bit, one of you can be teaching always in the practice of the lineage states,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 always reflecting the five perfect states. Five perfect, that is, you all heard them so many times,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.580
 I meet you, we all heard them so many times. But if we just only vaguely, we kind of are passing

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.000
 through,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.680
 our brain is not really observing what that means. And maybe we always think, oh, five perfect is

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 only one way,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 we can all think of the teacher, these things. But reality level, five perfect is three kayas

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.000
 states.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Three kayas states are not just one way three kayas, we're not talking everyone's three kayas

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 except us.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 We're not talking, that's what I mean. Buddha did not say, Il Dzogchen did not say,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 or everyone is three kayas states except the individuals. It means we all are three kayas states.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Everything what we see in three kayas states, and we make clear, subject is three kayas,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 object is three kayas states. There is nothing else beside the three kayas states.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 This means all total is three kayas states. We will elaborate on that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.650
 Then five perfect places, perfect places as three kayas states, perfect teaching as three kayas

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 states,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 perfect audience as we are three kayas states, perfect teaching as three kayas states,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 after how to re-world our view of any of the natures of three kayas.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And then perfect time is beyond three times, perfect time, perfect time, perfect places.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.790
 Where is the Dzogchen teaching? According to Dzogchen teaching, the teaching is continually flowing

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.000
,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 continually happening is unceasing, uninterrupted, continuation.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Continuation is flowing from the mind to mind, to the sambalas, to the aurata.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Those are three lineage systems, all the time happening. So beyond three times.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 To activate that is called then beauty, the understate.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.420
 That really is it. All kind of let elaborate three kayas states. Let elaborate three, then five

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.000
 perfects.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 So what is the grade in the teaching office? Five perfects.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 When a student sees a teacher as perfect teacher as some of the others.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 When a teacher sees a student also perfect five kayas states.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.280
 Perfect dial with a states. That activating of this is not just a kind of making power able to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.000
 sound that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 But we are revealing our inner quarters. Beauty.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 With that five perfect states, it will reflect the teaching.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Then the teaching is really absorbent. You begin the perfect way.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Perfect way and then it continually flow to the perfect.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 So therefore I mean this is the one. And then both each other is the call it of the five perfects.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Perfect teacher, perfect student, that audience of them. That is the call it of both each other.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Or call it of them. Call it. That means call it of nature of the mind.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 When three kayas is not just a only kind of like dry three kayas states.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Three kayas is a pull of love, pull of completion, pull of visitors.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Pull of considerations, full of common senses.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 Common senses, understanding that all the beauty is completely saturated in their call it of three

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.000
 kayas.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 Then their mind is that. That's what when we call Buddha is embodiment of love compared to the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.000
 visitors.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.270
 Not just the Buddha, Buddha's are, the light is are. And our nature of the mind, what we are

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.000
 talking, the Doki teaching, three kaya nature, is in that status.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 That is love. This is a computer. That is the worst of that. That is what nature of the mind is.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And that is what we are revealing. That is what we are revealing.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 We are revealing that qualities. So therefore this is very important.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And with those beautiful attitude and what we thought. And then we reflect the teachings.
