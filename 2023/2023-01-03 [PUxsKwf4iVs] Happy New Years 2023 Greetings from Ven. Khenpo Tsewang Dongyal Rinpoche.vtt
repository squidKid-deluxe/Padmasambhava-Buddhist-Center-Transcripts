00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 "First dealings, happy New Year's everyone, happy and very peaceful New Year's, any of which, very

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 peaceful, and today is a very beautiful day, of course, we all know it is New Year's, and so I'm

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.780
 going to do some prayers. I really wish everyone had a happy and peaceful and healthy and

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.000
 prosperous joy and then increasing of the body together."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.270
 "According to the directive teacher, Buddha Chaturmani, in the astral, as all the lineage masters

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.950
 say, the practitioners to keep up the body together is really the foundation of the dharma and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.000
 spiritual, and the foundation of all good things that we want in the world is body together.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 So keeping up the body together and preserving that with courage and commitment and blessings, I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 think all the wonders and beautiful that we expect really will come.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 According to the teaching, there is also awareness about that, and the body that is called

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.340
 terminology of Buddhism, but also is breakdown to simplify, is compassion. Kindness, compassion,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.300
 thinking of all the living beings and then activating that action with joy, peace, and respect and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
 appreciation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.050
 So that is really what is the practices and to me, I wish that all of us that we really increase

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 the body together.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.380
 We all want peace and happiness, joy, and that is same. There is no difference, regardless of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.000
 whatever the form and situation or language, color, you speak, I think everyone really want that.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And that is to bring that quality, is the body together or the compassion, with all the boundaries.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 That's really teaching. And it's true, we can work together, ourself.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.210
 So I just really want to open that. In that context, I'm going to do some prayers which everyone

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.000
 really wants peace, happiness, and freedom, non-violence, and aggression, and all the disease, pain

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:32.000
, and really so many difficult troubles that are kind of activating.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.750
 And besides that, of course, we all have some challenges, so I really pray of these, and you can

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.000
 join with my prayers, so you basically, whenever you already know these prayers.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.580
 So I'm going to pray to the three duels, Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, and Buddha, Chakra, Mani, Baraka,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.000
 Mahasambha, and Dara. And that's what really I want to do that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.670
 All of us, we call it, okay? It's not something that I'm the talker and you say, "Oh, I'm the same

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.340
." We're all the same, actually, most difficult, really the same, and so therefore we pray this,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 okay?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 (Singing in Dharan)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. And thank you very much to everyone

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 who participated in this celebration of the New Year.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.720
 It's really wonderful. We all had a perfect practice and meditated as much as we came to our best

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.000
 capabilities, reaching good things to everyone, which is really wonderful.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.200
 Thank, okay. Again, everyone, I will say, "Happy New Year" for all the Fachidele. Fachidele, all

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.000
 year long, and forever Fachidele. Thank you. Fachidele, best wishes.
