00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.440
 Good afternoon. Thank you for coming. We're going to begin today, as usual, the breath purification

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:22.640
 and some silent meditation. And then I thought, really, to use today to really settle into

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 our practice. Give a little bigger container to really settle into each section of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:41.680
 Ngondro. So we'll be using, as usual, our treasury of mantras and prayers and then also

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:59.920
 the Dudjom Tersaar Ngondro. So thank you for coming. Wonderful to practice together. Start

 So, we're going to chant the seven-line prayer.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:19:11.080
 We'll go to the calling the lama from afar.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.360
 That's in the dhrjum tarsar nundra, page 18.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:26.520
 Again, just a reminder to myself, a reminder for all of us, as we're chanting, really keeping

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:37.880
 connected with our joy, devotion, tender heart, loving-kindness, pure, just surrendering,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:59.320
 having devotional connection with the meaning of what we're chanting in a relaxed manner.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:07.200
 The essence, primordially unchanging, the innate nature free from elaboration, dwells as the

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:16.320
 youthful vase body, the originally pure, profound clarity, dharmakaya lama, yashe dorje, be aware

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.840
 of me, please grant the blessings to attain great confidence in the view.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:30.160
 The nature unceasing, conjoined configuration of luminous clarity dwells as the display

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:38.160
 of the spontaneously present five certainties, sambhoga kaya lama, dhechand dorje, be aware

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.760
 of me, please grant the blessings to perfect great ability in meditation.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:52.000
 The compassion without bias, the primordial wisdom free from all limitations dwells as

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.400
 the essence of all-pervading naked awareness, emptiness, nirmana kaya lama, drudu lingpa,

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:06.160
 be aware of me, please grant the blessings to accomplish great confidence in action.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.600
 The primordial ground of one's own awareness is unchanging and unmoving.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:20.080
 Whatever arises as the expression of dharmakaya is neither good nor bad, since awareness of

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.200
 nowness is actually the Buddha.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:29.180
 The completely free serene lama is revealed in one's innermost heart.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:35.040
 When this original mind is realized as the very nature of the lama, there is no need

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.960
 for winding contrived prayers made with grasping and attachment.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:46.260
 By letting go in the free natural flow of uncontrived awareness, not holding whatever

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.640
 arises, the blessings of self-liberation are obtained.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.560
 Through fabricated practice, there is no time to achieve enlightenment.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.080
 This meditation produced through mental analysis and intellect is a deceiving enemy.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.580
 Now conceptualization falls apart with the abandon of a madman.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.560
 Let this life be spent in a state of uninhibited naked ease.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.720
 Whatever one does, joyful, practitioner of the great perfection, in any company happy,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:28.240
 lineage holder of the lotus-born, protector without rival, great treasure revealing lama,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.560
 teachings beyond compare, hard essence of the dakinis, biphin dispelled the heart's

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.280
 darkness, great ignorance in its own place.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.200
 The undiminished sun of luminous clarity shines continuously.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.280
 This good fortune is the kindness of the lama, the only father, unrepayable kindness, only

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:59.320
 remember the lama, unrepayable kindness, only remember the lama, unrepayable kindness, only

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:23.920
 remember the lama.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:43.800

 Everything born isn't permanent and bound to die.

 The results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions,

 which are causes, are inexorable.
