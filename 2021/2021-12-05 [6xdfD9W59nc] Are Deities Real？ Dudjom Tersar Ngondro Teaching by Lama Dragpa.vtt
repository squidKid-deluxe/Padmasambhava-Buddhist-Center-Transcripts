00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.160
 Thank you. Welcome, friends. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. So we're here again. We made

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.040
 it. That's always a great fortune. And we've gathered together to explore some of the teachings

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.160
 of the Buddha in Gurumache, which is just such a tremendous extraordinary fortune. I'm so honored

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 to be able to be here, to be able to explore these teachings with you. And so first, as

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.940
 we always do, we just try to really reconnect and activate our motivation to bring up that

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.720
 joy and appreciation for this very special opportunity we all have together, to really

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.440
 see that all beings want to be happy. No one wants to suffer. It is a universal truth.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 And so why are we doing this? To really bring that to mind. We're doing this so all beings

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.500
 can be free of suffering and achieve enlightenment, total freedom. And then thirdly, to give

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.560
 ourselves a little window, give ourselves a little break and just let ourselves be good.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.000
 We can just be good. So connect to that sacredness of oneself, of one's experience, of what's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.080
 around us. So activate these three points in our minds as the lineage masters always

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:51.880
 encourage us to do. We'll do that together here.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:12.840
 So here we are. We're about to explore and open a big, bold, beautiful question. Are

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 deities real? That's the topic today for this brief little talk. Are deities real? And so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.840
 at the beginning, it's always important to remember definitely for myself, this is an

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.160
 immense question. And we're just peeking into it. We're giving a little room to, in our

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.360
 minds, like a little window of opportunity to kind of play and engage and be curious

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 about this question. It's a very big question. Are deities real? So step one, to entertain

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.600
 any question really truly, we actually have to entertain it, which means we have to be

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.240
 open to what the answer might be, not the answer we want to be, not the answer that

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.280
 has to be there for us, that we expect is going to be there, that all our friends think

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:21.720
 should be there. We actually have to be open to the inquiry. That's what an inquiry is.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.840
 To analyze, to loosen, to open, to fixate less. So fundamentally the question, in a

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.920
 lot of very simple ways, are deities real? It means am I in a type of awareness now that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:49.440
 allows for magic? That allows for creativity and flow and grace and connection. The sacredness

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.360
 of experience. Does my awareness right now allow for that? That's going to be a big part

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.100
 of any answer we discover when we look at such an important question. What's the type

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:14.380
 of awareness? How am I engaging this inquiry? I think this is a vitally important inquiry

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:24.480
 for everyone. We can look at it in terms of, for Tibetan Buddhists, definitely it's a big,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.420
 big question that really is vitally important to be with, to contemplate. For not Tibetan

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:41.480
 Buddhists, for not Buddhists, for just people. It's also a really relevant, important question

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:54.320
 to be open to. Are deities real? So, I was recently listening to an academic anthropologist,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.800
 cognitive psi person. Really amazing. Extraordinary. Going to give this big series of free open

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:11.360
 lectures on the, I won't name names and say things, but a brilliant mind was going to

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.400
 talk about topics like shamanism, altered states of mind, peak experience, flow states,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:29.120
 within five minutes of laying out this big, you know, 50 plus hours course, but then five

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.800
 minutes at the beginning he said, of course I don't believe in the spirits, all this mystical

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:56.400
 stuff. I'm a scientist. That's a red flag. Not open to that inquiry. There's a lot of

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:04.120
 inquiries we can investigate. But if at the very beginning of answering a question like

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.920
 are deities real, we laugh and we nudge each other and we say, ah, of course, you know,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.680
 we have science now. Of course, I'm, you know, an adult, you know, I don't believe in the

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:27.440
 superheroes and the imaginal this and that and I like ritual, I like drugs, I like shamans

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.180
 leading the way and flow states and stuff, but those deities, of course, that's obviously

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:48.160
 not true. Interesting. Isn't this interesting? We've gotten so good at so many things, but

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:57.360
 we're still very unwilling to investigate certain questions. Open mind, allow the magic

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:10.700
 to maybe be there. This is deep magic, deep creativity. On the other side, Buddhists,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:19.130
 a good friend of mine, long time practitioner, he was once in close contact with Tinley Norborim

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.280
iche

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.200
 and Tinley Norborimiche asked him to come. So he came to him and he looked at him and

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:42.600
 Tinley Norborimiche said, why is it that so many long time Buddhists hate Buddhism? That's

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:57.800
 really interesting. I think so. Are deities real? We could say it in a lot of ways. Are

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.120
 the six realms real? Is Akanishda real? Is Amitabha real? Is Gurumiche a historical figure?

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.880
 Was he born as an eight-year-old emanation on a lotus surrounded by daikinis with the

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:19.200
 Vajra seven-line prayer magically resounding around him? Are mantras real? Is there something

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:30.880
 after this life? Was there something before this life? Is pure relative truth real? Is

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:43.720
 all this baby stuff? I should be careful about how we answer that. So then I'm going to play

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:53.480
 mainly in the sandbox of Buddhists and specifically Tibetan Buddhists for just this really quick

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.520
 window into such a big, profound topic. And I'm locating this in texts, liberating duality

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:09.480
 with wisdom display by our venerable teachers, venerable Kemperimiches. According to the

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:18.280
 regular conventional way of thinking, if something is black, it is not white. Usually only one

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.080
 of these notions can be applied at any given time. When we try to make reality fit the

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.800
 limitations of our preconceptions, we become very narrow. Working in this way will not

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.120
 allow us to understand the mystical, profound aspects of the universe. Our tiny peephole

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.200
 of knowledge reveals very little of the actual world. We see only what fits through our small

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.360
 hole. Chronological and linear thinking is characteristic of dualistic conceptions. We

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.920
 cannot apply it to the true nature or the state of great equanimity. Peering through

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.720
 such a small crack will not allow us to see much. We have to open our minds if we're interested

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:18.480
 in seeing more. Are deities real? So before we go into the question, there's some good

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.560
 reasons why it's a relevant question. One, we just proved its relevance with the way

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.840
 that we engage this opportunity. Renunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception. These are the

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:41.920
 three pillars of Vajrayana Buddhism, the third being pure perception, pure body, pure speech,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:51.160
 pure mind. It's called deity, mantra, dharmakaya, pure form, pure sound, pure space. This is

00:10:51.160 --> 00:11:00.640
 a key, core, essential principle of Tibetan Buddhism. Part of the essence of the view

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:09.080
 of all the views of Tibetan Buddhism, there's six yanas of these views. Following bodhisattva

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.560
 yana, the third yana characterized by approaches like Zen, for example, or Rongtong like we

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:22.720
 talked about earlier. Empty of self, empty of fixation, this is the middle way view. In

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.240
 addition to that, there's six levels of tantric approach and they all believe in this pure

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:36.000
 relative truth, pure perception, pure view. Not as an accessory or as an option, as a

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.440
 fundamental principle that has to be included in order for Tibetan Buddhism to be Tibetan

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:52.960
 Buddhism, in order for Vajrayana to be indestructible, in order for mantra, mind protection, in

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.160
 order

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:01.320
 for our mind, our wisdom awareness to be protected from duality. Pure perception is essential.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:11.760
 This is a key Vajrayana point. Whom said this point? We just prayed earlier to all these

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.400
 lineage masters, the Buddha and Guru Rinpoche, Yeshe Sojal, Zor, Nu, Nyak, a hundred turtans

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.360
 and others, King Trits and Detsen. All these kama and terminal lineage masters, up to our

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.960
 very present own living, breathing teachers, they all claim that pure perception is actually

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:42.800
 how reality is. All of them. This should really cause us to pause. This question cannot be

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:54.080
 casually dismissed. Are deities real? Ha ha ha ha. Buddha said they're real. Guru Rinpoche

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:04.360
 said they're real. Vimalamitra, Chantarakshita, Longchenpa, Rongzompa, Naropa, Nagarjuna, they're

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:12.440
 all masters of sutra and tantra. You know how many of them became tantric masters? They

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.880
 got to the pinnacle point of studying the sutras. Many of them were heads of the most

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:24.320
 renowned institutes of Tibetan Buddhist learning, like Nalanda, Vikramalasila, or Sangpoon Naotong

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:34.040
 in Tibet. They got to the pinnacle of logic, of epistemology, of philosophy, of epistemics,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:44.000
 of poetry, of the 10 major and minor sciences. They were the best. And they saw that that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.960
 approach only went so far. They had to go beyond the framework of logical thinking, of dualistic

00:13:50.960 --> 00:14:03.040
 framing. They had to. They saw there was more. So how did Saraha become Saraha? He left Nalanda

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.040
 and sought a tantric teacher. How did Naropa become the great Naropa? He left Nalanda and

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:16.800
 sought out his teacher, tantric teacher. He sought out a guru. He sought to receive fifth

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:28.000
 instructions. He saw that logic only went so far. Shanta Akshita, female amitra, scholar

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.720
 practitioners. These are not drop out hippy dippies. They're not like, oh, feel the body.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:44.480
 Feel the sensations. This is reality. Of course, it's reality if you hit your hand with a hammer.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.720
 It hurts. It's reality. You feel it. There's a lot of wisdom in the body, and there's a

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.080
 lot of wisdom in the intellect, and there's a lot of wisdom in other ways of knowing that

00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:02.520
 aren't just logical, and they're not just body. The tantras really have this as a bedrock

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:12.120
 of what tantric Buddhism is. Post-conceptual wisdom doesn't fit into duality mind, dualistic

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:19.520
 boxes. The answer to our deity's real has to come from that post-conceptual place in

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:26.480
 ourselves, that way of knowing that knows differently and it reveals new things and

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:34.280
 it opens new magic, new understanding. We see things that we didn't see before. Isn't the

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.280
 path like that a succession of moments where we reveal a little more? If it's not like

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.840
 that, it's not a path. We're just confirming everything that we believe in. We're not opening,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.720
 we're not growing, we're not softening. We're just saying, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:00.400
 I'm right, see, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right. That's why we get a guru who gives

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.420
 us that mirror. How are we stuck? And what is it like to not be stuck? And then show

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.280
 us both those inside ourselves, where we're stuck and what it's like when we don't fixate

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:24.400
 in that way. I know this is a culture we really, we're so obsessed with ourselves. My wisdom,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:35.040
 my retreat, my practice, my accumulation. I'm my teacher. I want to be my teacher. Spiritual

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.520
 but not religious, right? It's the biggest, fastest growing religious group in the world

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:45.120
 right now. Spiritual but not religious. It means I don't want to be in your box. There's

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.560
 a lot of legitimate reasons to not want to be squeezed in someone else's oppressive box.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:17:01.560
 But if we make our own box, it's day one of that lineage. Take a little from here, a little

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.000
 from there. I'll take some Zogchen from here. I'm going to not deal with all that deity

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.240
 mantra stuff. I like the Four Noble Truths. Buddha always taught the yanas as a complete

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:19.060
 system. Every yana has a view, meditation, conduct, and result. They always stay together.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.760
 You can't take a view from Zogchen and match it with the conduct of the first yana and

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:32.480
 insert some behavior from the third yana. You don't get Buddhism. We have to really be

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.000
 aware of these things in our mind to have our practice really keep growing. Keep opening

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.080
 and not expire and be stale. And if we're outside of a lineage context, that's fine.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.920
 And we have to know what comes with that. And if we're in a lineage context, like Tibetan

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.260
 Buddhism is always in a lineage context when it's done properly. All the teachings go back

00:17:52.260 --> 00:18:00.160
 to the Buddha in Gurumice. And all this stainless succession of uninterrupted living wisdom

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.680
 and lineage. It's still alive. The blessings are still alive. They're still current. We

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.920
 can still connect to them. But if we just want to be our own teachers, that's fine.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.600
 But then we have to recognize, I thought this morning, it was so funny, in the seemingly

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:29.880
 immortal words of Cher. Snap out of it. Are we going to keep doing that to ourselves?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:37.400
 I'm my own teacher. Am I going to keep waking myself up? Can I keep going past what I expect

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:44.720
 and giving myself a fresh perspective? Can I do that in a way that actually is an organic

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.600
 natural process that keeps opening? Isn't it so much easier to be around some experts

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.520
 that help us learn more quickly, more thoroughly, more comprehensively? They've know this terrain.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.320
 They know this path. I'm not saying that's what everyone has to do. But amongst Tibetan

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:08.520
 Buddhists, that's what we're doing. We're following in the footsteps of the Buddha,

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:23.720
 Gurumice, pinnacles of scholarship, pinnacles of meditation. How fortunate we are. Another

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:34.920
 book, The Guru Drinks Bourbon. Once you've started this journey of practicing

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.920
 Vajrayana, many things can happen and you have to be prepared. It's important to have

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:47.440
 faith, but it's also good to have doubt and use reason. Often, faith comes in the aftermath

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:55.400
 of doubt and doubt comes in the aftermath of faith. And the one that comes second is often

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:04.040
 much more powerful. In the end, we have to abandon both. The Vajrayana Path is the union

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.280
 of wisdom and method, the union of science and faith, the union of myth and truth. But

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.420
 many materialists, those whose sites are not set beyond this life, don't see the non-duality

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.440
 of these dualities. They may be awed by the vastness and depth of the theory of non-duality,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.240
 but disregard faith and devotion, even though faith and devotion are the vehicles that effectively

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:36.220
 deliver you to non-duality. They can accept the logic of truth, but then snobbishly dismiss

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:42.160
 myth and ritual. They don't seem to understand that myth is the only means to understand

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:49.880
 the truth, because everything we say is myth. Even Vajrayana practitioners find it difficult

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.240
 or don't even think to try to marry these seemingly unmarable dualities. For example,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.120
 many apply the method, such as prostrating to the guru or offering a lotus flower, hands

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:08.280
 beautifully folded in the Anjali mudra, but they do so as a ritual without applying wisdom.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.840
 Prostrating is surrender, but very few people prostrate with genuine confidence. They don't

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:20.320
 think I'm prostrating to the deity who is none other than myself, and likewise the deity

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.600
 is prostrating to me. Knowing that the deity and the prostrator are one and the same is

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:34.960
 the ultimate prostration. Here in this book, I'll try to show you that the guru is actually

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:42.120
 like the horizon. A horizon is apparent, a line where earth and sky appear to meet, but

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:48.040
 in reality they never meet. There is only an illusion of an ending point, a point of

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:54.920
 reference where we can stand and measure and assess. In this way, the guru is like a horizon

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:10.800
 between wisdom and method, myth and truth, science and faith.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:17.360
 We just can't expect all of reality to fit into our working model, into my duality frame,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:24.760
 my preferences, my hopes, my fears, my expectations, my trauma, my wonder, my awe. Reality is very

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:35.720
 big. If we ever try to just squeeze reality into my model, the juice stops, the aliveness

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:44.960
 stops, the connection to reality stops. It's a desecration. We box ourselves in and then

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.580
 complain that there's no juice left. Life is so empty, so meaningless, and we boxed ourselves

00:22:52.580 --> 00:23:03.080
 in. We made it without sacredness, desacred. We got out of a type of awareness that appreciates

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:14.320
 magic. We lost the power of myth. We lost the connection that all relative truth is partial.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.920
 It's all a fiction. It's a dream, illusion, hallucination, fabricated, artificial. The

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:29.600
 Buddha taught this so clearly. Absolute truth, absolute truth, definitive truth is beyond

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:38.360
 this fixation. It can't be boxed in. We all come with reality for sentient beings, and

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.720
 we have to know this is a working model. The best thing a working model can do is try to

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.640
 replace itself with a better working model. And that's what the Nanyanas do. We

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.160
 use duality to have better duality, to have better duality, to go beyond duality.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.160
 We use science to find magic. We use magic to find science. We use faith to

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:08.320
 find reason. We use reason to find faith. We use practice to inform study. We use

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:16.760
 study to inform practice. It doesn't all fit into what I want, my box, what I know

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:25.520
 now. There's so much more than what I know now. We can't just cherry pick the

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.200
 pieces we like, because all we're gonna do is reconfirm our own bias. And then

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.280
 we'll get into echo chamber of groupthink, and then we'll wonder why is

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.680
 everything so polarized? Why is this so black and white? Why is everyone against

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:49.400
 me? Why are they all so dumb? We did it. We were participant in that tango. Weren't

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.920
 we? Did we make friends with them? Or did we just demonize them? We othered them. In

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.440
 the name of science, we other magic. Interesting. In the name of justice, we

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:10.600
 other the sacred. We desecrate. In the name of trying to restore the beauty and

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.320
 sacredness of life, we desecrate the sacred. I mean it's really weird. I'm not

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.680
 just saying little word games here. I'm saying from the more Tibetan Buddhist

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.120
 view, like we don't have to do this. There's another way we can like engage

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:35.320
 with open mind. We can keep looking. Snap out of it. We can keep waking ourselves

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.400
 up. We can keep using experience to help wake us up. What does that mean? Wake us

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:48.240
 up. Refreshing. Fresh air. Fresh evidence. Our practice. Fresh, you know. If we always

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:54.800
 do a practice one way, good. It's good to get constant and in a groove. But we got

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.840
 to switch it up some too, you know. Otherwise, it just gets habitual. We

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:07.240
 forget. The point is to be in a fresh, connected, really like in all type of

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.760
 experience all the time. These great masters are in like childlike wonder

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.360
 with reality all the time. And they can manage these giant monasteries and

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:23.120
 nunneries and meet with world leaders and maintain a living lineage for

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.520
 centuries without breaking it. That's an impressive feat. I haven't seen any

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.000
 modern scientific materialists pull off an uninterrupted living lineage wisdom

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:41.680
 for 2,500 years. They must be doing something right. It can't be casually

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:50.280
 dismissed. Oh, that's pre-modern myth. Deities and all these things. There's

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:56.920
 maybe something more going on here. If we don't let ourselves actually have a real

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.440
 investigation of this question, it's not and it's not a real question. To quote

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.380
 Derrida, the only real question is what you don't know the answer to. To quote a

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.800
 postmodernist. To push postmodernism to go beyond itself. When we get too

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.720
 self-assured. My practice. My way. This is how it is. This is what the Buddha taught.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.480
 Open this. I look I looked at this today. Rinpoche's great Gurya Garba. Splendid

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.800
 presence of the king of all Tantras, right? This is filled with reasons about

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:39.720
 why reality is pure. You can open a page. It's pouring out. The sacredness of

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:49.520
 reality. The sacredness of all experience. We really think we're smarter than the

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.400
 Buddha and we're gonna redesign Buddhism. We're gonna update it. 3.0, 4.0, 5.0,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.720
 whatever. We can't even keep a community together longer than five years or

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.000
 something. Without the big, the seemingly indented, it's almost like a syndrome now.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.320
 I'm like saying some strong things but sometimes some strong things have to be

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:24.120
 said. Is this a mental syndrome? White male investor syndrome. A lot of people

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.760
 seem to be non-dual gurus nowadays. They don't like the word guru but they'll

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:40.280
 sell you stuff and they figured it out and it's five points. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Somehow

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.360
 they can't keep a community together longer than five years, something, ten

00:28:43.360 --> 00:29:00.640
 years, whatever. This is better than what the Buddha taught. Snap out of it. It's

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.600
 called humility. It's the main quality when I see people who are really

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:13.760
 investigating that question. Are deities real? They're so humble, so open, they're

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:23.360
 so fresh, they're still looking. deity, mantra, dharmakaya, pure body, pure speech,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.080
 pure mind. These are the essential points we repeat again and again and again.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:36.000
 That's still amazing for them. Why? Because it's living. They're in it. It's

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.200
 alive. It's living dharma and they prostrate to the deity and the deity

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.920
 prostrates to them and everything is a deity. Outer deity of the guru, inner

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.400
 deity of the subtle deities. Janasattvas, wisdom beings. The actual

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.480
 wisdom beings in a sadhana practice when we visualize Tara, for example, that our

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.640
 visualization is the samayasattva, visualized deity. It's pretend, it's

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.120
 duality. But then we ask the living deity, the wisdom deity, the jhanasattva, actual

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.960
 living Tara to come and bless that, to merge and mingle with our conceptualization

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.240
 so that it becomes inseparable. Why? Because the nature of all of it is deity,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.840
 mantra, and dharmakaya. Pure body, pure speech, pure mind, pure form, pure sound,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:30.920
 pure space. It's already like that and we're just waking up to it. We're seeing

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.520
 in a new way and we're open to the possibility. Maybe it can be like this.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:42.560
 Maybe the Buddha was right. At the very least, we're willing to do the experiment,

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:49.640
 to put in some time, do some nundra practice, to study and look closer.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:55.160
 We're willing. We're not like, "Oh no, thanks Galileo. I'm not gonna look down

00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:05.560
 the telescope." Isn't that what a casual dismissal is like? "Oh deities, hahaha."

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:13.200
 I haven't seen germs. I haven't seen atoms. I haven't seen quarks. I haven't seen

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.280
 11 dimensions. I haven't seen other galaxies. I've seen pictures of them. I've

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.120
 seen models of them, ideas of them. People talk about them like amazing things, you

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:30.000
 know. It all requires faith. So much requires faith. If our standard for truth

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.640
 is direct perception, that's it. What we do is we become a nihilist. Only what I

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.880
 can see, hear, taste, only according to what I can think, feel, that's nihilism.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.000
 It's limited to my little very small corner of reality.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.080
 Kazakhstan, that must not exist. Never seen that. Center of the earth, never seen

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:04.200
 that. This is how we get this post-truth madness. Oh my, my, my experience is the

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.320
 kid, the pinnacle. That's what I'm gonna use to determine everything. I'm sorry.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:14.400
 That's how we get all this madness. Everyone's personal. Then the person with

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.400
 the strongest conviction wins. Is that how like a healthy mature civilization

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.520
 functions? The loudest person wins. The roughest person wins. The one with the

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.840
 most conviction. Because the Buddha taught us to have certainty conviction

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:37.600
 and that everything's pure. Didn't he? In our practice, that's the one of Vajrayana

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.320
 practice. I'm trying to unpack this topic in different ways. In Vajrayana

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.860
 practice, that's one of the three qualities. CPS, clarity, purity, stability.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.400
 Stability is Vajra pride. Unwavering conviction that I am the deity.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.560
 Everything I experience is the deity. Not just my meditation box, my room, what's

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:06.640
 around me. Everything is pure. Everything. And it always has been. That's one of the

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.800
 three pillars of Vajrayana practice, being Vajrayana practice. We have to have

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:18.680
 that. Vajra pride. Unwavering. And that's where it's a really key point. During

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.000
 study time and contemplation, we study and we contemplate. And during practice,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.400
 we practice and we don't mix them. During practice time, we let

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:34.040
 ourselves be the deity. We try to see everything as deity. We allow for that

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.280
 possibility. And even if not just allow for that, be in a magical state of

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.580
 accepting the sacred. The mystery, the awe of what could happen, you know.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:49.040
 We can even just allow for it. And then we really have to just let ourselves

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.240
 really have conviction and courage. And we grow this little by little over time.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.720
 That's why it's a practice. That's why it's a path. Little by little, by little,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.080
 by little, by little, by little. And then we'll have these threshold big break

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.480
 pivot point moments. And wow, we'll kind of see things newly. And what is it like?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.840
 Love and compassion and devotion. So much devotion comes up. Oh, thank you for

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.000
 showing me this. Thank you for the technique to reveal this. You show me the

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.160
 path. You show me the experiment. And I put some time in and now I see it. And

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.280
 like, what is that like? Then we check in. And they keep helping us. These people,

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.640
 the elder wisdom. People way farther along than us, you know. They help us grow so

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.720
 fast. The best teachers want all their students to surpass them. They're just

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:44.520
 trying to hold enlightenment for themselves. They want everyone to wake

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:51.760
 up. The more people who wake up now, the better. It's really like bodhisattva

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.120
 question, no? What would I trade if in this room right now that I'm sitting in,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.600
 at home, looking at the screen, or in here, in this room? What would I trade? I could

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:12.120
 wake up right now off the wheel of samsara, on the boomies, boom. Or everyone

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:21.880
 else in the room can. And I'm stuck in samsara still. What are we going for? What

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:30.280
 are we going to choose? My wife can wake up and I can say to stay closed. Or I can

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:35.640
 wake up and she can stay closed. He can stay closed. They can stay closed. What

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:44.440
 am I going to pick? These are real questions for practitioners. Because it's

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:50.080
 just saying, what is my mind like now? That's the practitioner question. What is

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:58.660
 my mind like now? Do I allow for the sacred? Or do I not? Do I allow for wonder

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:06.320
 and magic and awe, merriment, cheer, rejoicing, exuberance, power, dang, salt,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.200
 ropa, all these things, you know? Because the Buddha taught all of these pure

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.960
 relative truth. It was the union of rangtong and shantong, the second

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.120
 and third turning. And then the tantras came based on that. Open mind, power of

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.960
 the expressive qualities of bodhicitta. We take these skillful practices of

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:34.920
 atriana and we just let all this karma self-liberate. We don't say it's bad and

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.920
 now I gotta wash it away. We let it come and release. It releases itself on knots

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.200
 itself. That's what atriana is doing. I'm not saying I can do it, but that's the

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:57.720
 teaching, and it can be really simple. I know sometimes we want an answer. Is a

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:04.720
 deity real or not? Like show me the money, you know? Where's the video? I'm quoting

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.560
 Tom Cruise now. Share and Tom Cruise. Wow. It's all in me, this conditioning. I can't

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.520
 avoid it, so I'm gonna use it. I'll use the duality to try to break out. I'm gonna

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:29.400
 break out of that Tom Cruise prison. Snap out of it. We want to see the video

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:35.800
 recording, you know? Maybe it requires a new way of seeing. Another way of seeing.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:42.040
 A deeper way of being. It might just be that it doesn't all fit into my model.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.200
 Doesn't all fit into my box. It might be bigger than that. It might be more

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.840
 special than that. Are we ready to allow for that level of specialness that

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.980
 everything is sacred? Tibetans have done that for as a culture, as a people.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.380
 They've done that and what's been the result? Just in general. They care for the

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:09.040
 land. They didn't desecrate the land. Even like go to try to take opportunities to

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:16.640
 not hunt any animals, even though the food was hard to get. They like, after

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.960
 this big genocide, there's so many of them are so forgiving, you know? They're

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.780
 even more compassionate for the people and the systems that really hurt them,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:31.200
 killed them. Killed all these people they know, you know? So I mean, it's like, how

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.240
 much more proof in the pudding do we need, you know? To actually care for the

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.360
 sacredness is an important feature. The disaster of modernity that

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.240
 stripped everything to its bits and quarks and like ones and zeros and what

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.400
 only what we can nihilistically see with our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.640
 That's great. We put someone on the moon and we can excavate all the living

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:59.360
 systems of the planet. We're good at it, you know? We're very adaptive to totally

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.000
 transform, terraform our environment and we're terraforming all the time with the

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.320
 views we have, right? Our view completely terraforms our experience and the

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.960
 Tibetan Buddhists are saying, have an open view and you will start to see the

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:23.080
 sacredness, the pure body, pure speech, pure mind. That will terraform. It'll

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.240
 start to change the way you engage with your own habits. You'll start to love

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.640
 your emotions and not hate them. You'll start to love your friends, not love the

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:39.200
 enemies, you know? This view is so key to actually enact any of this stuff because

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.360
 if we really believe they're an enemy we can do all these five of this and seven

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.720
 of that and all these like tools we can take all these little things and put them

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:55.760
 in our tool bag. But if we don't activate that view as step one, allow the

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:02.360
 possibility that sacredness happens. This is sacred. This is wholesome. This is

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.360
 fundamentally good. That's why ethics is the foundation of all the other things,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:13.680
 samadhi and wisdom. We seem to have lost that in every other field of

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.360
 expertise in the so-called advanced modern contemporary culture. Like all of

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:23.280
 them are like completely devoid of ethics. Doesn't that seem to be true? Tibetan

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.480
 Buddhism ethics is like always you can't if you don't have ethics there's not a

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.200
 next step. That is what the Buddha taught for has so long thousands of years.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.520
 There's a lot of wisdom here that we've overlooked and as practitioners it's our

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.360
 job to kind of keep activating it.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:48.420
 It's our job to let the possibility maybe this is all enlightened now. Maybe my

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.840
 nature is fundamentally good and the really quick thing that we've all heard

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:59.000
 but it's really comes down to the juicy points you know. Everything is mind. Mind

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 is empty. Empty mind always expresses itself as energy. This energy is

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.640
 unceasing a rising display of the nature. Everything is this awakened empty nature.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:26.240
 This display of mind. We've all heard that. Those are like the Buddhists that's

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.480
 called a pith instructions you know. I'm not saying I'm giving a pith instruction

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.240
 but we've heard it. It's all mind. Mind is empty. Empty mind always arises as

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.640
 energy, as knowing quality. That knowing quality displays itself as objects

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.640
 experienced by awareness, a subject. This all happens purely and everything we

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.400
 experience all the objects are pure. Pure relative truth experienced by what?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:55.520
 Pure wisdom. My Dharmakaya mind experiences the Dharma dot to object.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.820
 That's the playground of Adriana. Dharmakaya mind experiencing its

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:06.320
 sambhoga kaya expression displaying as nirvana kaya. This is the playground we're

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.280
 in. This is what our nundra assumes you know. This is what we're key. We use that

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.320
 as a working model, a conceptual model, to let ourselves leap into it and allow

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.520
 maybe I can maybe this is true and we do that again and again and again and we

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.720
 get stuck in our practice and get in our habits we got to shift it up and ask for

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.160
 help and we keep trying to have it be a living experience of the sacredness of

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.120
 life of our own mind of our own heart of everyone we see then everything becomes

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.440
 a deity everything becomes the teacher and in the meantime we use a teacher a

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.200
 realized awakened being to see that it's all the teacher that wears good

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.600
 Rinpoche course Guru Rinpoche is out there and he's the visualization Samaya

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:54.280
 Sapa and he's the actual living Guru Rinpoche and he's also my mind that is

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.560
 true absolute Guru Rinpoche my mind everything's Guru Rinpoche in this view

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:07.000
 it's all deity we don't have to be so literal but we can be very literal

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.760
 Amitabha and Guru Rinpoche is a certain form and all this is a full spectrum of

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.320
 tangibility here really obvious to really really subtle but as are they're not

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.500
 really kind of too finicky on these details they don't get obsessed Guru

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.840
 Rinpoche has to only look one way you know or Chenrezig has to only look one

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:32.760
 way they don't fixate like that that's not the teaching right may I be a boat a

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:41.000
 breeze a bridge a memory anything that relieves suffering anything anything

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.280
 Guru Rinpoche can be anything we have to let anything be Guru Rinpoche and in the

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.760
 meat that's the view that's what we're getting to that's the fruition and on

00:43:52.760 --> 00:44:00.040
 the path we need to keep remembering that reactivating that this is my mind

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.720
 it's open and empty of fixation all this bodhicitta comes up as it's a rising

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:11.000
 display which becomes these beautiful ornaments of sight smell sound taste

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.640
 touch thought feeling this is the mandala and it all circles back to the

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.680
 wisdom nature of emptiness and it all read out circles and expresses as the

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:32.440
 display this is like straight Vajrayana view so we can we have to do this we

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.920
 have to enact this and we zoom in and we zoom out and that's what we're doing all

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.840
 the time we zoom in on the Guru Rinpoche's nose and we look in at the

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.640
 atoms of his nose and we see on the atom of this nose is a millions of mandalas

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:51.240
 of deities and we zoom out out out out out out out out and everything we see in

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.000
 all the Hubble telescope things we that have ever been seen by humans they're

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:05.480
 like the pupil of Guru Rinpoche can we be that flexible that's what Vajrayana is

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.880
 training us to do to disrupt our habitual patterns to disrupt our

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:20.080
 convenient comfortable framing new fresh alive communicating happening it's

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:26.800
 happening and we open and we relax we let us do a thing and then we close and

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.480
 then we open and we relax that's the blessing of Guru Rinpoche then we

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.520
 actually start to see according to all these Tibetan Buddhist teachings though

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.240
 all these Bardo teachings after death there actually are these living deities

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.680
 true new Bardo of the true nature right it expresses this light sound light

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.240
 beams peaceful and wrathful deities they said those are actually there we just

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.640
 don't see them now covered by duality fabrications I don't see them they're

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:06.160
 actually there they're more real than art my limited karmic vision the Buddha

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:11.760
 saw so much more than me I have to have that genuine humility that genuine

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.360
 interest what more did he see how can I see like that too the how is really the

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.880
 interesting part because it's not just holding a belief hard everything is

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.320
 deity everything is deity everything is duty that's not what a mantra is mantra

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:33.920
 is protecting the mind from obsessing with it duality model protecting the

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:40.160
 mind from being all fixated that's what a mantra does open refresh new new new

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.400
 new new new new because life is always that's reality it's always new ever

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:51.680
 changing interdependence and ribcage book this great do you garba tantra these

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.960
 four points they go into this there's hundreds of pages long the great do you

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.480
 garba tantra was the root tantra of all the Maha Maha yoga tantras the beginning

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.580
 of the inner tantras they said there's four points that establish the four

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.480
 reasons in this book the four reasons that establish the inseparability of

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:17.740
 great equality and natural purity they go through these four the four reasons

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:25.160
 that everything is a deity one call it the reason of the cause of the one cause

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.560
 the reason of the one cause and I'm going through this fast the single cause

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.520
 of samsara and the single cause of nirvana the same single cause is one's

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:45.880
 own mind and here we're talking about wisdom mind unborn awareness this is

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:52.360
 what's pointed out in a middle way view why the sutras are essential middle way

00:47:52.360 --> 00:48:01.000
 view unborn what's the next unceasing by nature like the sky the second reason is

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.680
 that this unborn mind ceaselessly displays as experience as energy

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:16.840
 unceasing display the second reasoning of unceasing display all this is

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:23.040
 unceasing display of mind unborn because if we try to really find mind we won't

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.920
 find it in a fixed logical way that's middle way teaching there's a lot of

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.000
 teachings to actually come to that resolution and a lot of the Zogchen

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.120
 instructions ask us to do that inquiry look for your mind look for your mind

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.300
 look for your mind and this way and this all that second point second reasoning

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:50.880
 that open unborn nature unceasing display unborn unceasing unborn

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:57.920
 awareness unceasing display isn't this similar to like emptiness is form form is

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:06.480
 emptiness form is emptiness that's empty mind emptiness is formed unceasing

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.520
 display this is heart sutras the prasad parmita

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.560
 sutras went so deep they went right into the tantras it just has to be revealed

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:22.800
 the third reasoning unborn wisdom awareness is always inseparable from

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:30.120
 unceasing display they're always together this is very casually said in

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:41.840
 Vajrayana emptiness awareness emptiness and clarity in union they say when it

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.940
 when we see that as inseparable unborn awareness unceasing display it's called

00:49:46.940 --> 00:50:00.420
 the seven treasures of absolute truth the first is this the first is like the

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:09.960
 I don't want to get that word wrong yeah the first is called sphere of absolute

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.800
 truth container the second is called the wisdom of the absolute truth that's the

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.600
 subjective awareness happening in the container object and subject right but

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:27.880
 pure those are inseparable and the other two the five other treasures are pure

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.480
 body pure speech pure mind pure activities pure qualities so in this

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:37.360
 union of unborn nature and unceasing display we have the seven treasures of

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:44.080
 absolute truth arise naturally that becomes a lived experience and that we

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.760
 get so that's called a reason of blessings that's the third reason in the

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.880
 giri garbatantra chapter 11 then the fourth reasoning is the reasoning of

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:59.040
 direct perception we see for ourselves with no inference or deduction that

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.200
 everything is always the union of emptiness and it's unceasing display not

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:11.320
 filtered through any duality boxes that's the fourth reasoning these are

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:17.000
 the four proofs that everything is the great purity in union with the great

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.520
 equality of absolute truth unborn wisdom awareness arising is ceaseless display

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:29.440
 always inseparable in union and we experience that directly for ourselves

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:35.600
 not mediated through duality mind you can please look at this teaching of

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.640
 venerable camperomaches splendid presence of the king of all tantras the

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:49.760
 great giri garbat we're so fortunate to be a part of this the great jangam in

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:56.920
 pomeranpoche he said the four things for the most thoroughly established truth it

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.780
 fits with the words of the Buddha it follows the words of the lineage of

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:06.240
 enlightened masters it follows the personal advice of our own teacher and

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.560
 it conforms with our own direct experience this is the most rust robust

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:16.920
 type of evidence in Tibetan Buddhism a simpler way to say that is it follows

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:24.080
 all the scriptures it follows logic and it's confirmed by our own intelligence

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:32.680
 that's called certainty wisdom it's not I hit my hand with a hammer and I am

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:38.560
 certain of the truth of the pain but the Buddha taught that to truth suffering and

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.000
 all that you can go through how all these things fit when we really have a

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.680
 conviction that's unwavering and we should be confident in but regarding the

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.080
 great union of great equality and the relative natural purity of all phenomena

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.920
 otherwise known as a deity this is a core belief of Vajrayana Buddhism of

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.520
 Tibetan Buddhism and this is assumed with every sadhana practice and as

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.860
 practitioners following a lineage to humbly let ourselves like just bathe in

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:12.120
 the nectar of these wisdom blessings of the sacredness of our opportunity of all

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:18.000
 of our experience to let ourselves allow for the possibility that maybe this

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 really is all enlightened maybe my nature is enlightened in your nature is

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:29.760
 enlightened and even if we do it just as if as if it's true as if I'm enlightened

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.920
 and you're enlightened wouldn't that change so much bring back the sacred

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:40.160
 wouldn't we love each other more fully wouldn't we have better ethics wouldn't

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.800
 we care for our environment wouldn't we think of more long-term intergenerational

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.240
 what's gonna happen way after me how am I preparing for what's coming next

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.600
 wouldn't that all be just great even if we just say deities are real I'll just

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:58.760
 act as if it's true in the meantime I'll test it in my experience in my practice

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.380
 and I'll see for myself have a direct perception over time won't life be more

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.080
 beautiful like that

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:22.880
 I'm just like saying a little few words of like some teachings I've received in

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:28.280
 these teachings vermiches they're all there for us to enjoy and to explore

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:33.360
 ourselves and to open ourselves the beauties there the means are there the

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.560
 practices are there the experiments are there the containers are there the

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.380
 sanghas are there the living lineage is there all these endowments we have these

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:45.040
 endowments we just have to stay a living part of this process in order for it to

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:50.480
 keep happening I'm so glad to be a living part of that process I'm so amazed

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:56.280
 and you know when the it arises as deity and the deity points out all the ways

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:04.040
 I'm being stuck I pray that I will humbly surrender to that wisdom experience

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:10.160
 and I'll let the crazy wisdom of having my own fixation be pointed out so

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:18.080
 finally I can just let that go you know let some new air in the room open up

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:32.360
 let this let it just be sacred thank you friends thank you

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:50.840
 so the quick thing I forgot to mention about the the inquiry of our deity's

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.520
 real the answer to this inquiry from the Tibetan Buddhist perspective really

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:05.080
 highlights a significant distinction between Zen and Zogchen so Zogchen is

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.680
 the great completion the great perfection it's the ninth and highest

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.560
 final Yana taught by the Buddha and Guru Rinpoche and it includes all the sub

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:22.320
 yanas including sutra Mahayana which is an example one example of that is Zen so

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:28.200
 in general that approach of the bodhisattva Yana or Zen it really it's a

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:36.160
 specialty is pure mind wisdom mind right called sometimes called beginners mind

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:47.080
 and then the tantras add to that pure body and pure speech that's called deity

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:54.120
 and mantra plus dharmakaya right which is pure mind so the tantras always have

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:59.320
 pure body pure speech and pure mind and so we can see how Zogchen then would

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:05.080
 include pure body and pure speech that's a deity and mantra in order to bait in

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.880
 order to actually be Zogchen to be the great completion and include all the

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:16.080
 approaches taught by the Buddha not saying it's it's not judging the the

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.320
 approach the other approaches the more foundational ones it actively loves and

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.720
 includes them so that's one distinction that highlights like the importance of

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:33.020
 like how we answer for ourselves or make sense of our deities are real is it's

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.800
 another way to say that is pure body and pure speech is that something I'm going

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:44.600
 to actually let myself kind of mingle with deity and mantra and then just to

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.920
 kind of put the context of kind of what I went over that was mainly from

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:54.600
 meditation so there's meditation and post meditation and in meditation it's

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.160
 very clear the Vajrayana view the succinct way to talk about the three

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.420
 bhadras of pure body pure speech pure mind is everything is transcendental

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:09.440
 wisdom rainbow body so that's the succinct way to just say that's the view

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.380
 held in a Vajrayana Buddhist context in a practice session that's the view we're

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:18.840
 trying to see the presence of enlightened body speech and mind both

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:25.640
 outside and inside completely mingling as enlightened activities all happening

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:31.480
 within open expansive infinite awakened awareness so that's pure body pure

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:36.160
 speech and pure mind then in post meditation when we get up and engage the

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:42.160
 world if we believe everything is deity so how do we deal with suffering in the

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.980
 world how do we deal with people who are mean to us so that's when it's really

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:51.960
 careful to distinguish between yanas and like his only in his due to Rinpoche said

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:59.160
 like on outwardly we follow according to proctymosha conduct we follow cause and

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.160
 effect its impeccably Rinpoche often says timidly very carefully we follow the

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:10.840
 details of cause karmic cause and effect inwardly we follow the bodhisattva yana

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:18.040
 the view of bodhicitta relative and absolute bodhicitta secretly we follow

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:22.960
 the pure perception of pure body pure speech and pure mind and we're trying to

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.720
 maintain that all the time and meditation and post meditation but

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.480
 post meditation is more how we show up with what we say and what we do

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:36.660
 communicating with others and that's proctymosha level the inward motivation

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:41.880
 is bodhisattva yana the secret view is Vajrayana and we're trying to do all

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.640
 those three in harmony with each other as a single complete sphere or system

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:51.300
 this great perfection view that's what Zogchen really is talking about there

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:55.200
 then and so we can very carefully distinguish that's the thing with a

00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:01.720
 wisdom awareness it has the five wisdoms it's not just open it has a mirror like

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.840
 wisdom all accomplishing wisdom Darmadatta wisdom distinguishing wisdom

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.240
 or discriminating awareness wisdom it can very carefully distinguish things

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.800
 and that's where the answer to the question are deities real is very

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.440
 interesting because in a certain context when we're engaging with others we can

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.480
 say no they're not if that's the most helpful thing because the Buddha didn't

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:32.280
 talk about deities and all the sutras right in I mean it's so it we really in

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.480
 terms of our outreaching activities our view has to match up with what's

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.760
 happening around us and then that view matches with that conduct and that

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.560
 behavior and that meditation and we can do that as in our display or in our

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.320
 outreaching activities and inwardly we're holding we're trying to hold this

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.920
 vashri on a view with this motivation of bodhicitta so it doesn't mean just think

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.040
 everything's a deity so always be worshiping every event even the horrible

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.280
 things and the mean things like we have to actually use this discriminating

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.400
 wisdom because that wisdom is fully happening when we're actually allowing

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.480
 pure body and pure speech and pure mind to happen it's not just blank emptiness

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.200
 awareness right we're actually engaging the relative phenomena according to the

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.560
 relative frameworks that the phenomena are working on that's called skillful

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.080
 means or skillful effective helpful communication so I wanted to highlight

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.480
 that because that's a big important question so that answer to our deities

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.000
 real it can be very different depending on how we're engaging and on our own

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.280
 side you know the reality of deities goes beyond thinking about a deity or

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.960
 not a deity or pure or not pure I mean it really goes beyond that kind of

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.560
 questioning interrogation it's allowing things to spontaneously be there and

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.280
 then we're opening ourselves on the path to seeing new emergent phenomena that we

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.280
 missed before more subtle features of reality that we just weren't there were

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.800
 over our heads we weren't available and open to notice yet and that's when they

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.840
 say the pure expression pure relative truth expression of DD and mantra really

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:21.560
 starts to become a direct living experience and so even if we have that

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.760
 direct experience we still show up and communicate with others according to

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.560
 what's helpful for them and that's always part of the Vajrayana view

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.760
 because Vajrayana always includes Sutra Mahayana it always includes

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.480
 foundational Buddhism that's how it maintains a healthy complete system so I

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.960
 just didn't get to saying that I wanted to say it sorry to kind of like round

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.360
 that out sorry thank you
