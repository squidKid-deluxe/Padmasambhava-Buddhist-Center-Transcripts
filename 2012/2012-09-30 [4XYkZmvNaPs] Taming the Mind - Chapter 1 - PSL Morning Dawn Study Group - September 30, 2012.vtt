NOTE     "synopsis": "First Broadcast of Morning Dawn Study Group from Padma Samye Ling - Sunday, September 30th -  Discussing the first chapter of Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches' book, The Buddhist Path, called \"Taming the Mind.\"\n\nVenerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche has asked that we begin offering monthly broadcasts of the PSL Study Group. This is the beginning of a comprehensive, long distance PBC Morning Dawn Study Curriculum that is being designed to thoroughly study and practice the wealth of teachings that the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches have so kindly offered us over the course of many years. An online PBC Study Curriculum is currently be developed to facilitate this study program.\n\nDuring the past year, the sangha at Padma Samye Ling has met three times a week to study and discuss the teachings of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches. So far they have studied The Buddhist Path, Illuminating the Path, Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence: A Commentary on the Heart Sutra Prajnaparamita, and The Madhyamaka School.\n\nIn this video, the four main points being discussed from \"Taming the Mind\" are:\n\n1. \"Everything we experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant, is the result of causes and conditions related to our state of mind. The mind produces all our experiences and perceptions. When we tame the mind so that it rests calmly and clearly, then all our experiences are open and relaxed. When the mind is peaceful, then simultaneously the speech and body become peaceful. But if the mind is uncontrolled, then our words and actions are also out of control. Until we tame the mind, experiences of joy do not last more than a short time, no matter how many external supports we use. It is only by taming the mind that we can truly understand ourselves and others and find ultimate peace and joy.\" (pg 1, 2-3 paragraphs)\n\n2. \"An important point about disciplining the mind is that it is something that we must do for ourselves. We cannot depend on someone else to do it for us. Buddha Shakyamuni taught that you are your own protector and savior. It is through controlling the mind that you will achieve realization and develop inner wisdom. Taming the mind does not mean eliminating outer objects or suppressing inner thoughts. It means revealing and maintaining the natural state of the mind.\" (pg 2, 2nd full paragraph)\n\n3. \"It is important to remember that our true nature is only temporarily hidden. When we know that, we can work with courage and joy to remove the ignorance and let the essence of the mind shine forth. It is important for our diligence to be based on a joyful attitude, because without joyful effort we cannot reveal this true nature.\" (pg 2, last paragraph)\n\n4. \"All the levels of the teachings by Buddha Shakyamuni are dedicated to subduing the mind and bringing out inner wisdom. Once we are able to tame our wild thoughts, then everlasting inner peace and joy will manifest. This is not a fairy tale \u2014 this can be demonstrated by personal experience. Once you have this realization, your mind will be unshakable like a mountain, always calm and peaceful.\" (pg 6, last paragraph)\n\nFor further study of this topic, watch the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches' teaching:\n\nCalm Abiding Retreat instructions 2009\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL47CF455AC0C95E4D\n\nOn September 6, 2009 at Padma Samye Ling, the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches gave Calm Abiding Retreat instructions on practicing the Dharma by analyzing the positive, negative, and neutral states of mind.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
 Welcome to the first PVC Morning Dawn Study Group at Padmasamyalang. We've all gathered

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 here. Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoches has asked the local Sangha Padmasamyalang. Now

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.920
 we've been gathering for about a year or so, three times a week doing study group. And so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 this is the first time Rinpoches asked us to do a live broadcast webcast. So we're here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.520
 at PSL. And then thanks for joining. We'll do an opening on prayers to the lineage. And

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 then we'll begin discussing our topic today is the first chapter of the Buddhist Path

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.320
 by Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoches, and we'll be discussing this first chapter of

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 the Bhagavad Gita, which is the first of the three. And then we'll begin discussing our

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 topic today. So let's begin.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 [Music]

00:01:43.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 [Music]

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:39.320
 [Music]

00:02:39.320 --> 00:03:07.320
 [Music]

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:20.320
 [Music]

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.320
 So then we'll begin this. We have four main points we'll be discussing today from this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 chapter, Taming Them On. So would anyone want to read this first point?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.320
 First point. Everything we experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant, is the result of causes

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320
 and conditions related to the state of our mind. The mind produces all of our experiences

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.320
 and perceptions. When we tame the mind so that it rests calmly and clearly, then all

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 our experiences are open and relaxed. When the mind is peaceful, then simultaneously

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.320
 the speech and body become peaceful. But if the mind is uncontrolled, then our words and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.320
 actions are also out of control. Until we tame the mind, experiences of joy do not last

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.320
 more than a short time. No matter how many external supports we use, it is only by taming

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.320
 the mind that we can truly understand ourselves and others and find ultimate peace and joy.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 Pages 1, 2, and 3.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320
 What do people think?

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.320
 I have something to bring up. I thought of something here. You know, this part where

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.320
 we're saying that no matter how many external supports we use, we're not going to have

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.320
 any kind of lasting happiness. It's like, how can people really be convinced of that?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 You know, like in our culture, we have such a materialistic consumer culture. How can

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 we or how can anyone really know that that's true? What's necessary, in terms of, to be

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.320
 able to see that? What do we need to do to be able to see that?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.320
 Just try.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 Try to see it.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320
 Try to see it?

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 Just, I mean, that part too, it seems like you're, she's bringing up two points, but

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.320
 that one part of looking at how we fixate on the outer conditions for our happiness or

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.320
 for something. And so just even on the level of the Buddhist, you know, training of the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 mind that's just learning to settle down, you know, on that part of conduct, just learning

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.320
 how to just relax, even if, you know, and then there's this step of looking at the nature

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.320
 of our mind, but just that level of, you know, just to like relax a little bit and actually

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.320
 just be quiet and peaceful. I mean, that's one aspect and one step that I think everyone

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:51.320
 gets some freshness from just, you know, again, it's not maybe ultimate liberation, but still,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:06:00.320
 as far as just learning to, you know, it seems to relax a little bit and not be looking out

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.320
 so much or relying so much, but just actually taking the time and giving it a chance, you

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 know, because then of course we see the way, maybe our habits might keep looking out or

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.320
 finding something to be looking at, but just that process of actually engaging.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.320
 And also just kind of how all external supports fall apart. I mean, things aren't, they're

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.320
 not lasting. I mean, like you get a nice car, it's going to need new brakes, it's going

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 to be, you know, just like those, these conditioned things, they're like, they are, that's their

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.320
 nature is to crumble at some point. So to me that's pretty convincing.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.320
 I wanted to see the conditioning as being conditioning because we're continually conditioned

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 again and again to think this, to think that we will every time, even if we don't read

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.320
 any magazines, even if we don't watch the TV, even if we stay off the internet, we still

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.320
 walk down the street when we're confronted with a billboard which has been designed using

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.320
 all our weakest points to make us feel that we, if we get it, we will achieve happiness.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.320
 So in a way we need to sort of go deeper into a level beneath and just see that we're being

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:30.320
 conditioned and that I think would lead to a suspicion, if not a kind of some form of

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.320
 liberation from that. I don't think we need to see that.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.320
 It's also, I think in, even if you look at just from your experience with people, how

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.320
 easily someone you think is a friend and is going to bring you happiness and oh, I have

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:45.320
 so much fun with this person and then at some point that shifts and it can be a creation

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.320
 of suffering rather than happiness and that speaks a little bit to you about that impermanent

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.320
 nature of all things external until the mind is tamed, nothing that we hold outside of

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.320
 ourselves is going to bring any kind of ultimate or lasting joy or happiness and I think just

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.320
 that concept if it's taken in and people just look at their own life and see how many times

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.320
 has that happened in our life where we think something's going to make us happy and then

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.320
 two weeks later it's creating suffering and making us miserable, it's, I think, I don't

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:25.320
 know, maybe that's how, maybe sometimes people can see that progression or that space where

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.320
 we see that happiness ultimately has to come from within our own mind as does suffering.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.320
 A piece of it too seems to come out of mindfulness, you know, particularly when we're, a lot of

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.320
 what life is saying when we're giving ourselves that chance to actually slow down and watch

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.320
 these things and I think we went into this a little bit before in study groups about how

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320
 when we actually slow down and start to watch what's actually happening that, you know,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.320
 as we're engaging with those external things, you know, how much of it is actually happiness

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.320
 and it's that mindfulness when we allow, even if, you know, a lot of times they talk about

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.320
 short time but many times, you know, that coming back constantly to mindfulness and seeing

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.320
 what's actually going on. I think then you get a lot of that chance to see that window

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 of how it's not happiness, at least not the external object.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.320
 At very least it's temporary at the very least.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.320
 And it seems like two part of what, like, I was talking about kind of just setting up

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.320
 like what helps us get there, just all the teachings on like the four thoughts that turn

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.320
 them up, turn the mind toward the, toward, you know, the nature of our mind and of all

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.320
 phenomena, which impermanence is definitely one of them.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.320
 And then also looking at, of course, all just our favorable, beautiful conditions, both

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.320
 our outer conditions and our own inner qualities, our interests, you know, we don't have time

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.320
 to go through all the freedoms and endowments, but just how like Rinpoche's have said again

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.320
 and again, you know, how for Dharma practitioners always beginning our sessions with those four

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:10.320
 thoughts and just how in all of our practice, they really, I think the metaphor that Kempor

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.320
 Rinpoche said is like kind of, it helps kind of soften the soil, you know, for like the

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.320
 buddha seed, the seeds of our Buddha nature that begin to have some air and some growth

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.320
 and begin to shine more, just contemplating those four thoughts in a way, looking at our

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 situation and how precious it is and some sorrow, I mean, all of the, you know, those

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 main points with the four enunciation thoughts, just how it really kind of sets up this situation

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.320
 that kind of widens our vision and helps us tune into our own goodness qualities as well

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:55.320
 as like how kind of temporary and fleeting everything is and how precious and beautiful

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.320
 it is too, you know, kind of just really so well rounded and full like the way all the

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.320
 four thoughts kind of really set up those beautiful conditions that kind of bring like

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:14.320
 a breath of fresh air in a way and then kind of inspire us to go deeper.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.320
 Well on that same mind, like I think part of it is we have to look at the context that

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.320
 we're in, you know, like Trump or Rinpoche said in cutting through spiritual materialism,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.320
 like oftentimes in the West, like or at least for most of us, we've had all these comforts

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.320
 our whole lives. So we're actually in a unique position to be able to be like, wait, this

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.320
 isn't enough. Like I have everything I need, you know, health, education, friends, et cetera.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 And still there's like something lacking. It's like the poverty mentality, like something

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.320
 but for some other people too, like maybe in other cultures or in this one, they never

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.320
 had those things. So for them, it might be a little more difficult because they want

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 to get those things because they don't see that those things won't necessarily bring

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.320
 happiness because they're lacking their basic needs. So that's one part. But I think this

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.320
 poverty mentality of thinking that we don't have enough or that we're not enough or that

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.320
 we need, you know, like is a really big habit, you know.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.320
 I think that uniquely the point we're at in history where we are really, really strongly

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.320
 conditioned, really strongly conditioned from every side and we're consuming more media

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.320
 than we ever have. And that I think one of the big ways to get out of it is just to see

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.320
 why this conditioning is occurring, why, what vested interest is there in keeping us in

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.320
 a state where we continue to think despite the fact that our experience proves us again

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.320
 and again and again that this is not reliable, that we keep clinging to the idea that this

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.320
 is reliable and that we cling to concepts because we're frightened and just accepting

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.320
 that as a society, from individual to group, we are frightened and accepting that truth

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.320
 and having the confidence and the bravery to confront confusion in place of that, I guess,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320
 is important.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.320
 I'm going to just totally relate it to what you're saying. So what is it that is reliable?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.320
 I mean, it's like what's really the primary distinction between temporary happiness, lasting

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.320
 happiness, something unreliable, something reliable, because it's like a key point that

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.320
 we really have to discern on the path and keep coming back to like really what is lasting

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.320
 because it almost seems like there's impermanent happiness and then permanent happiness. But

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.320
 what is this permanent happiness because so many times in Buddhism that really at certain

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.320
 levels say that it's all impermanent, impermanent, impermanent. So what is this permanent happiness

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.320
?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.320
 The permanent, you have to, as the beginning of being a Buddhist practitioner, you're told

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.320
 to jump out of the safety nets of all this conditioning, which for all its horror is

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.320
 fairly reassuring from time to time, even if only briefly. You're told to jump out of

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.320
 that into something that to begin with is extremely uncomfortable. You're told, right,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.320
 okay, all this stuff that you're feeling, you not only have to feel that, you have to

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.320
 feel guilty for it and also you don't have a self and all this kind of stuff. So you're

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.320
 jumping into something very uncomfortable from being, so you just, I guess, have to have

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.320
 faith because you don't see what is permanent and immediately it takes practice. You need

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 to move towards seeing that and I think once you've felt that and experienced that, it's

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.320
 much easier to have joy in following the path there. That kind of intermediary stage where

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.320
 you've kind of left and you're not quite sure if there's a net, that's really quite a scary

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:44.320
 point. Yeah, what I wanted to say, in fact, it ties into one of my questions that I have

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.320
 when I read this. When we tame the mind so that it rests calmly and clearly, then all

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:57.320
 of our experiences are open and relaxed. So to me that's the answer, that in the taming

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:08.320
 of the mind, when we reach our places in meditation practice, that the mind becomes more rested,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 then we experience a sense of calm, peace, joy, there's a real sense of peace. Now, my

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:29.320
 question was, what does it mean for others in the group when Rinpoche say, all of our

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.320
 experiences are open and relaxed? I just would like to hear from other people what that might

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:43.320
 mean to them. I think there's a saying that when you have a certain level of calmness

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.320
 or relaxedness in the mind, you can be in the eye of the storm and there can be chaos

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.320
 all around, but you can stay in that stability of that relaxed, open state no matter what

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 the outward circumstances are. And I think that's most, the point of practice is that

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.320
 kind of mind training and taming the mind that no matter what external circumstances

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.320
 coming at you, whether it's anger, whether someone's coming at you with abuse, slander,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 whatever, that you've got the practice to have that stability in your own mind to see

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.320
 that for what it is, to see that ultimate reality of whatever's going on here doesn't

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.320
 touch this at some point in the practice, if the mind is stable, open and relaxed in

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.320
 a stable way. Is that what you think is, I don't know, is that that permanent?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 What is that permanent?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 Stability can last for years and years and years and years and then it can stop. So what

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.320
 is really the characteristic that makes it unchanging or permanent, really, not affected

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.320
 by causes and conditions? Because we can be temporarily stable in that temporary stability

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:57.320
 like for the God's realms. It lasts for billions of human years. So really how are we to

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.320
 distinguish

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 between really that lasting happiness?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.320
 Is it that side of the wheel of life? When you exhaust all your karma and become liberated,

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.320
 is that the only time that it's permanent, right? I mean that's what the teachings kind

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320
 of say.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:19.320
 It seems like, I think that a piece of this, just a piece of it is not the answer, is the

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:28.320
 attachment and the grasping and that for me, it says experiences are open and relaxed.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:37.320
 So to me what that means is that there's this capability within us to not be holding on

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.320
 tightly to what's happened.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.320
 Because if you think of what our conditioning comes down to at a really deep level, it's

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.320
 basically safe, not safe. And we're just all the time trying to distinguish between like

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.320
 I want this, it'll make me more safe, I don't want this, it's going to attack me. So being

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.320
 open and relaxed is just losing that kind of fear that I think haunts everyone who's

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 not in some kind of more steady state. I think a lot of things are kind of haunted by this

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.320
 feeling of feeling really profoundly unsafe and I think that the feeling up and relaxed

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.320
 is just a kind of safety, that things aren't going to come and attack you, that if you

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 don't, you know, you cannot get this car and it's going to be fine, your wife is not going

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.320
 to leave you, it's going to be okay, like you cannot buy this lipstick, you're going

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.320
 to be fine because you're fine as you are. I suppose a sense of contentment as you are

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:35.320
 and not always having to construct barricades against things and kind of decide what you

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320
 want, you know, just...

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:46.320
 Two kind of main points I saw as reading this is Rinpoche in regards to taming the mind

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:53.320
 or, you know, just relaxing more. There's these two aspects to taming the mind. It's like

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:01.320
 looking at the state of our mind, kind of like, which is like how we're perceiving things,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:07.320
 how either limited or vast that might be, you know, how much ignorance, aversion, attachment,

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.320
 hope, fear, you know, all the worldly concerns that are there, kind of more state of mind

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:20.320
 and then through the practice of learning to just kind of calm and stabilize the state

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:28.320
 of mind we can begin to more clearly and clearly see that that too is very temporary in a way

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.320
 and that look and then to the second aspect which is seeing more the nature of our mind

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.320
 which is maybe that's a little bit more becoming more and more familiar with not just the state

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:45.320
 of our mind but the nature of our mind and like kind of just looking at those two aspects

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.320
 seems like kind of it runs through the whole chapter of the way working with those two

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:57.320
 things works and it seems like the more we can create conditions where we can become

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.320
 more familiar with the nature of our mind as well as and that is the nature of everything

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:11.320
 that we're perceiving but that's maybe part of that kind of more permanent, reliable

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 being so inseparable.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.320
 I think it's only that we get to that point where we're talking about the nature,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:25.320
 that's what's unchanging. Anything else is temporary, I mean like the states,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.320
 like you're saying, all of the states are always changing.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:35.320
 What I mean is what they say is that only the nature is what's not changing.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.320
 But even on subtle levels isn't that changing? Even the Buddhists say there's still that

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:45.320
 evolution and that even the nature of mind is still evolving at some point, yeah?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:58.320
 What the display is there, it's a display too, it's not just a point.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.320
 It's just the recognition of the nature is developing but the nature itself is clear

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.320
 from the beginning. You could be the nature if it changed.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 That kind of goes into the third point that was on there about how there's that,

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:22.320
 it's important to remember that our true nature is only temporarily hidden.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.320
 When we know that we can work with courage and joy to remove the ignorance

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.320
 and let the essence of the mind shine forth,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.320
 it is important for our diligence to be based on a joyful attitude

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.320
 because without joyful effort we cannot reveal this true nature.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:44.320
 It kind of goes into what you were highlighting before about how at first there's that moment of,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 what is this? It's been a long time.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:57.320
 I think a lot of that is more recognizing that grasping and that attachment.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 I remember when I first got into Zen, the teacher at the Zendo was talking about

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.320
 how when you first start meditating it will seem like you're actually worse off than before

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.320
 because the metaphor he was using is how most people are floating down a river

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320
 and meditation is learning to stand up in the river at first.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.320
 Of course it's going to feel worse because you're feeling the current,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 you're feeling the current of everything that you've gone along with,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.320
 everything that you've been pulled along with and so you're feeling that.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.320
 Of course it seems much worse because now you're actually seeing everything

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.320
 that used to just be an assumption.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 I think that's like all of the things that were striking for you.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 I think the really frightening thing is I don't know,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 in London they have this thing where they announce on every tube platform

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 why the gap as you're stepping off the platform onto the train

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.320
 and I think the sudden perception of that gap is the thing that really scares people.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.320
 When things go wrong and when suddenly something appears and you're told,

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 "Oh, you thought this was the case? It's not the case. That's really scary."

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.320
 You're stepping into that scariness and you're saying everything

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.320
 that I thought in the past may be unreliable or to analyze it

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.320
 and that's a big thing I think.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 And that fear, it seems to me, that fear really just comes from that grasp

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.320
 and then clinging to sense of self anyway

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 because if you have an awareness that there is ultimately nothing to hold onto,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 then there wouldn't be fear around something happening

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.320
 to that thing that there's not really anything to hold onto.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 That's like that analogy of jumping out of the airplane, which I love so much.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.320
 I think we've spread it up in study groups a couple of times

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.320
 but really we're trying to let go.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.320
 So jumping out of the airplane, whether you have a parachute or not,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 doesn't really make a difference if there's no ground, it doesn't matter.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.320
 So that's what they say in the teachings, like just letting go.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 There's different methods. You can have a parachute

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.320
 which will kind of slow the fall and maybe make you more comfortable with the process.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.320
 But either way...

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320
 The whole process is a bit like standing on a plane and being told,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.320
 "You can't feel your parachute. It's very small and when you push this button

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 it's going to come up and you go, "Okay, and we'll go, "Listen, look at all these people.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320
 They've done it before. They're fine."

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.320
 You're like, "Okay, I can't see any of them. They're beneath the clouds."

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.320
 And then you just have to jump and you just hope to hell

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.320
 that this small button's going to open at something.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.320
 But I think there is this profound feeling of discomfort as you're falling

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.320
 that you may not be flying, you may just simply be falling.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 And that's big, I think.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.320
 I think that part of this, it's tricky. It is a tricky point because open and relaxed.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.320
 Normally we think that means everything is great.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.320
 Everything is happy. Everything is good. Everything is great.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.320
 I am calm. People are nice. That's not what it means.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.320
 It means, I mean, from one sense, yes it can mean that.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320
 Don't mean that a bit.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.320
 I was reading something last night and it was a Zen master, Shunur Suzuki.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.320
 And this one of his students, he kept asking over and over,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.320
 "But what about how to get comfortable basically? How do I get comfortable?"

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.320
 And at a certain point, he just totally flew off the lid and he's like, "Spyless!"

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320
 He's like, "You all are spineless. All of you are spineless."

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 He's like, "You always want the sweet pill. You never want the bitter pill."

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.320
 He's like, "You want to get out of suffering."

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.320
 He's like, "That is not our way. This is suffering."

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.320
 He's like, "Our experience, we're all going to die. We're all going to get old.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.320
 We're all going to have aches and pains. It's going to be cold outside.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.320
 We're going to be sitting. It's going to be sore. You know what I mean?"

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.320
 So open and relax. I'm just emphasizing that.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 It goes that way. He's saying it's the courage. It's the joyful effort.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.320
 It's not trying to totally make everything like puppies and sunshine.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 You know what I mean?

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 But I mean from one's own mind, the way that one is working with that experience.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.320
 Aside from that, this paragraph, I was really having problems with it.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:31.320
 If we try to find the cause of our own unhappiness, we may think there are various things

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.320
 and people in the world that cause our suffering, but this is not so.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.320
 The external factors that bring sorrow at one time can bring joy to another.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:47.320
 Yes and no. I think we have to look at that because riboches are a great example.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.320
 Different experiences that they went through.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:57.320
 Some experiences are really rough, like warfare, external circumstances.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:05.320
 And that's not necessarily a cause of happiness at one time.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.320
 I'm just saying that the point that they're emphasizing here and in the next paragraph

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:18.320
 is that it's one's own mind that we can't control everything that happens.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 We can't control hardly anything that happens, including our own bodies.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.320
 We get sick and have troubles, but we can work with our own minds.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.320
 It's the only thing that we can work with as a stable way.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 That's why you can attain enlightenment that way.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.320
 That's how you can attain enlightenment.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.320
 Like the Buddha said many times, "All the Buddhas have a pure land, but look at you.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.320
 You're in this world. This isn't a pure land. This is samsara."

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.320
 And the Buddha said, "No, this is a pure land. Everything I see is gold."

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.320
 Even though he was in India, you guys have been to India, I haven't.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.320
 But they say it's rough and tumble, isn't it?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.320
 That speaks to the second point, actually. It really does.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.320
 I think it's really important what you're saying.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.320
 May I read?

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.520
 An important point about disciplining the mind is that it is something that we must do for

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.320
 ourselves.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.320
 We cannot depend on someone else to do it for us.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.320
 Buddha Shakyamuni taught that you are your own protector and savior.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.320
 It is through controlling the mind that you will achieve realization and develop inner wisdom.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.320
 Taming the mind does not mean eliminating outer objects or suppressing inner thoughts.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.320
 It means revealing and maintaining the natural state of mind.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:44.320
 When I read that, I also had some of that stickiness come up around being my own protector

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.320
 and my own savior based on conditioning around what that looks like.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:57.530
 Even when we do the Jarmapala, that seems to me like that's protection that we're invoking and

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.320
 calling in.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.320
 How does that work with, "Okay, but I'm my own protector"?

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.320
 That's almost a metaphor for our own protection.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.320
 We're externalizing the mind and we're drawing it in.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320
 Understood.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.320
 This point also spoke to me about the Guru Devotion as well.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:21.320
 That we get very attached to the Guru doing it for us, to the teachings, to our teachers

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:27.700
 when they're in fact just giving us the road map and that we're the only ones that can do it for

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.320
 ourselves.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:35.190
 I think that's a huge distinction to let go of the fact that anything outside of ourselves can do

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.320
 this for us.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:45.320
 There's two of the three jewels, Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:55.080
 When I read that paragraph, what kept coming to me was taming the mind does not mean eliminating

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.320
 outer objects.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:06.320
 In one way, our teacher is the teachings.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:17.600
 When we see it that way, it's a great help to invigorate and stimulate our own joyful effort and

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.320
 move them forward.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:28.320
 The other part of it was eliminating outer objects. We cannot eliminate what happens to us.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:36.320
 We can't eliminate what happens in this world. There are bad things that are going to happen.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:43.320
 The next sentence says, "It means revealing and maintaining the natural state of the mind."

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:49.320
 Which is the second way you ask the question. What brings us?

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.320
 Where does that happen? Permanent happiness.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320
 Permanent. I'm looking at it.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.320
 Are you lying? What is the working time out?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:02.320
 Permanent happiness. And that's the process.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:11.320
 A metaphor came to me, and I would like to share it, in that a sculptor oftentimes will say

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.320
 that the image is within the stone, and he has to chip away, or she has to chip away.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:23.320
 And that's when I think about this innate nature of loving-kindness and compassion and wisdom

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.320
 that we are, you know, and our teacher is guiding us.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320
 I know I didn't finish my sentence.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.320
 We are chipping, we are chipping, getting ourselves out.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.320
 We're losing those obscurations, those veils, but that nature is there.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:46.320
 That nature is there. And our job is to reveal it, right?

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.710
 So I would say definitely, just related to that point, is that it seemed really clear in this

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.320
 chapter for me

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320
 that this is a Mahayana view.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:01.320
 What's a principle distinction of Mahayana view, which also brings a lot of these questions,

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320
 is there's, in Mahayana there is Buddha nature.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 And so another way, and it says this many times in this chapter,

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.320
 Buddha nature, natural awareness, innate nature, pure nature, all those unchanging qualities.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.320
 So there's like a principle division that's really been helpful for me

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.320
 is that we talk about mind, and there's so many types of mind, and it kind of gets confusing.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.320
 They refer to the mind, but mind is unchanging, you know?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.320
 Like eliminate the negative dispositions of mind, reveal the unchanging pure qualities of mind.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.320
 So it's kind of mind is being used differently, and even in a single sentence.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.320
 So like one principle distinction that's been helpful for me,

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:45.320
 and it's definitely a principle distinction of Mahayana, is there is dualistic mind.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:52.320
 Mind is characterized by grasping, and then there's non-dual wisdom awareness, or innate nature,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 and that's not characterized by grasping. Like that's the principle difference.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 Grasping mind, non-grasping mind. Dualistic awareness, non-dual wisdom awareness.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.320
 And if we have that distinction, which they repeatedly say in this chapter,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 eliminate ignorance, reveal the nature. This said five times in this chapter, literally.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.320
 I mean, that's the key point that's like said so many times, five times in this chapter.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.320
 And it's a big, I mean, really that distinction, and then it really can make clear about,

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.320
 like even if you're looking at other teachings too, if we say, "What?"

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.320
 They say mind. What is which mind? Dualistic mind? Non-dual mind.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.320
 Because it can really clarify a lot of where is the teaching coming from.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.320
 And this is definitely very much a Mahayana teaching.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.320
 And then also they say that this is a Buddha nature's principle quality of the Tantras too.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.320
 There's Buddha nature and revealing its qualities, and that's Tantra.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.320
 I mean, that's like definitely straight into Tantra.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:59.770
 So from the Tantra view, one would acknowledge and recognize intuitively the qualities of the

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:00.320
 nature.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:07.320
 I mean, via the teachings, obviously. And then one cultivates that.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.320
 I mean, I'm kind of trying to get the difference between the Mahayana view and the Tantra view.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.320
 We have a few minutes left. Anyone want to say it after this?

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.320
 We have like two minutes, summation.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.320
 I remember Japa talking about before.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:31.860
 Part of the difference between the Mahayana and the Tantra is about how they view the relative

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.320
 truth.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.320
 They both agree on the absolute truth, on that emptiness.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.320
 What the Vajrayana and the Tantra does is it then, based on that understanding of emptiness,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.320
 looking back at the relative truth and it brings an understanding of pure relative truth.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.320
 I don't know if that's a summation.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.320
 Pure relative truth, big topic.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:02.320
 When they say infinite loving kindness, infinite compassion, infinite joy, infinite equanimity,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.320
 this is really another way of saying it in more Tantra terms, is a pure relative truth.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.320
 Not conditioned love, permanent love.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.680
 What is beyond temporary love and permanent love is the unconditioned love and the natural quality

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.320
 of mind.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.320
 This is also revealed in Sutra Mahayana too, and Tantra Mahayana.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.320
 There's still the difference there. It's tricky.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.320
 There's still the four boundless which are infinite love, infinite compassion, those four.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.320
 It's still something there to really keep looking at, myself, definitely.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.320
 Maybe it would be a good time to bring up the fourth point.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.320
 So what's the fourth point then?

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.320
 The fourth point going off of this is, all the levels of the teachings by Vodashakkimuni

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.320
 are dedicated to subduing the mind and bringing out inner wisdom.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.320
 Once we are able to tame our wild thoughts, then everlasting inner peace and joy will manifest.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.320
 This is not a fairy tale. This can be demonstrated by personal experience.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.320
 Once you have this realization, your mind will be unshakable like a mountain, always calm and

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.320
 peaceful.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:21.320
 The question I had on this, I know we're running low on time, is,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:29.490
 Rinpoche has said many times that if you understand relative and absolute truth, you understand all

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.320
 of the teachings.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.330
 I've heard him say that many times, and when it says here that all the levels of teachings are

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.320
 dedicated to subduing the mind

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.320
 and bringing out inner wisdom, and yet he goes back to that constantly.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.320
 It seems like every time we have discussions or debates of any kind,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.320
 it always comes back to relative and absolute truth, pretty much at some level.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.320
 So my question is, why don't we just shut your mouth to an absolute truth?

00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:04.320
 To me, the focus and the central point of everything is literally relative and absolute truth.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:12.320
 He said it during Shudra, he said it so many times, that ultimately, and absolutely, and relatively

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.320
,

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.320
 if you understand that, you understand all of Buddhism's visibility.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.850
 And also just what Krapa was saying about these two levels of mind, the grasping mind and the non-

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.320
dual mind,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.320
 it's the same thing, it's the relative and the absolute.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 So it's just different linguistics or semantics around that concept.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.320
 All the teachings are different angles of presenting that.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.320
 They're really specific for circumstances that we experience,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:47.320
 so that's why I think it is important to kind of come at all these different angles.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.320
 It's like a shape that we don't quite understand, that we keep walking around,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.320
 and we can't look at this perspective however much we walk around it.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:59.500
 So we're just trying to stand again and again at different angles to try and make a full view of

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.320
 this shape

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.320
 and try to grasp it, so I guess that's all we do.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.320
 In terms of the nimma school, the full view includes at least nine levels, so nine yamas.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.320
 And Rupiches have definitely taught us many times,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.320
 each of these levels has its own view of relative and absolute truth.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.320
 So based on the view of relative and absolute truth,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.770
 then there's a specific meditation, conduct, fruition that comes from that specific way of looking

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.320
 at relative and absolute truth.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.320
 They don't all agree on this, like each of them disagrees in a way,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.320
 or recognizes what the more fundamental level does,

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.730
 and then kind of makes it a little more inclusive, a little less mistaking, or you could say a

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.320
 little less grasping.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.320
 So the whole tendency is to go up through the levels,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:51.320
 refine away this more outer grasping, more subtle grasping, and then finally no grasping.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.780
 So that's the ninth level, or ata yoga, like totally free from all grasping or mistaking, you know,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.320
 sojourn.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.320
 And so the practice is like removing all grasping,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.320
 revealing the nature that was previously covered by that grasping.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.320
 But each level has its own way of defining relative and absolute truth, so this is really...

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.320
 That answers my question, thank you.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.320
 I want to do like silent meditation for just really quickly, and then we'll dedicate the merit.
