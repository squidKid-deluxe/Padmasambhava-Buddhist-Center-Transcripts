00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.460
 We have so many motivations, so many, it's like two years of motivation, there is always a happy

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 growth, coming, changing, all that,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.260
 but when we do practices, we are going to practice motivation. There is something so spiritual, so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 beautiful, yet it's natural.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.710
 Natural is simple, our own, our own mind. That is then, of course, you all know, is joy and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.000
 appreciation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.490
 That is very important, that is the first step of our practice. Being a human being, it should be

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.000
 wherever, we are wherever.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.490
 And for those reasons, when I get a master's seat, every time, even those hermitages, the practice

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.000
 of hermitage,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.790
 spend whole life practicing, they always say that when you wake up in the morning, it should be

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.000
 very grateful.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Today is a new life, new day, new things. In a way, it really is completely new, new.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And how wonderful, how beautiful that I am here, I am going to do more beautiful things.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Just come, bring more joy and appreciation. That is the appreciation of life.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And then, of course, many of you know, I mean, it's not something that you don't know.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And in the Buddha's teaching, we have the 18 endurments, those who are practicing dharma.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 They have the 18 beautiful qualities. Again, these are not called accidental.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.650
 It has so many cause and conditions. Cause and conditions of which is also known as dharma in the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.000
 past.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And also cause and condition of these lives. Combined together, we have this beautiful life.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 They are eating different qualities, eating qualities, add freedoms, 10 luxuries.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Above them, we have more. That's the basic. We have more freedom and favorable conditions.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And that's what it's called. So really, bring more joy.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 This is not just a kind of burden. This is not something that we do in side track of the practices.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 That very is hard practice in Buddhism, in the Buddha's teaching.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 When we think of the enlightenment, we talk about all these beautiful feelings.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 All those we heard, we know the people and we hear enlightenment.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Enlightenment is not going to come later or in the future, three countless years after.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Enlightenment begins right now with our own mind.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Right now, that enlightenment is the joy and appreciation is light of that enlightenment.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.090
 It is the beams of enlightenment that's shining from the deep of the midst of our own happy

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.000
 dependence.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Even covered, we have such beautiful rising energy, deep is coming.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Being grateful, joyful, grateful of these all beautiful things.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 That is practices. It's not that side track of the practices.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 And we don't have the joy and appreciation that we practice.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Our practice is boring. Our practice is kind of a burden.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Our practice is kind of dark. But if we lighten up that beautiful qualities,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 being grateful, being joyful, then practice is practice with joy,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 practice with appreciation, practice of gratefulness.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And we got plenty every time this and that, not for a goal.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 I like that. And the rest ignore the big things.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 That's not practical. So we have to be practical and with common sense,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 with the guidance of our gracious compassion teacher of the Buddha Chaturman.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 He gives such a great teaching really, such a beautiful teaching of love, kindness,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 compassion, respect and appreciation that will reveal our beauty and nature.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 So bring up that.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 To a good with not just joy and appreciation, bring more compassion.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 That is combined in Mahayana technique known as bodhijata.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Bring more compassion. You are thinking of all living beings, bodhijata.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Again, this bodhijata is not side track of the practices that we do in practice.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 It is essence of the practices. It is essence and foundation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It is practices. Again, if we don't have the practices of the bodhijata,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 though that practices, what practice will be?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Practice will be that very ego practices, self-important practices.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Self-important, self-centered mind and ego kind of practice,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 that we will be practicing for the biggest time until now according to Buddha's teaching.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And what will is achieved? What will be fulfilled?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 More trouble, more difficulties, more kind of hesitation,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 more doubt, more worries, more anxieties and is continually clashing that.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 We are in a way kind of clashing and kind of completely trapped in this status.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Therefore, we have to change the course. Have to change the course.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Bring more body. That's every great master.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 See, everyone, no different with this school, that school.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 All say the same thing. And then, of course, Buddha said it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Continue with that. So this, again, bodhijata is not alien,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 something that we bring Buddhist dogma here or try to make something change.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Again, reveal our nature, our beauty, our color.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Love is our nature. Completion is our beauty, our treasure.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 What's known in intelligence is our treasure.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Reveal that. If we let to dispel the darkness of the ignorance,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 those difficulty trouble, bring more compassion, bring more joy.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Let light up that our self with all those big goals.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Buddha's teaching is not teaching some of the different things.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Buddha said, I didn't give you anything new things except the way things are.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Big things are just pointing out. We all will have that.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Spread those qualities. And then, talk it with them.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Then, the pure understands. This is the very end of practices.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 The very end of practice in that day is not something that we bring new drama or new ideas.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Reality level, everything is beauty status, including our mind.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Subject and object in all is very special and beautiful, authentic status.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 But we mishandle it. We call it up exactly where natures are,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 and we are wondering and roaming on the illusion of what we call it up.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Slow them down. Reality level, everything is beautiful, beautiful.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 So we have to remove the catalyst of this, what we created,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 and reveal what the natures of things are.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 That is to move towards that direction.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Then, bring more beauty and understands.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 The whole view, a better form, a better song, and a better mind.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Those are the teachings said, and that's what we are going to highlight.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 With those beautiful motivations, and now we practice on such activities.
