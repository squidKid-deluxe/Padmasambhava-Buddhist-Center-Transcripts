00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 Dzogchen, what meaning Dzogchen? I mean many of you already know. Few of you, if you don't know,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.570
 don't Dzogchen familiar with this world. Dzogchen is a Tibetan world which means great completion,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.000
 great completion.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.280
 What is completed? The two merits are completed. Akhmalachian merit and Western merits are

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.000
 completed all in there. Everything is.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And all the three kaiyas are completed. And all the samsara, nirvanas are completed within this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Everything is completed.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And what is that Dzogchen? That is our nature of the mind, our nature of the mind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.260
 In Dzogchen teaching, that is the terminology, meaning the terminology of Dzogchen. And then, with

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.000
 that, and then in Dzogchen teaching, what do we say? The ground Dzogchen, path Dzogchen, and result

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Dzogchens, or fruit Dzogchens.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 Ground Dzogchen is our inner nature of the mind. Your nature of the mind, often in the Buddha

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.660
 teaching, generally in the sutrayana teaching, what Buddha taught, tathaga, tathaga gharva, tathaga

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:19.000
 gharva. That is really ground Dzogchen.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.200
 Nature, ground, ordinary nature. This level, ordinary nature, has no difference between anyone,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 anyone. Whether you are human beings, whether you are animals, whether you are asuras, or gendavas,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 or gods, or heirlooms, or whatever, the nature is the same. There is no difference at all.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.080
 Then, since we are not going to practice that, that is known as path, because of that beautiful

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.890
 college that we have all inherited, we are not going to leave that in the darkness of all the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 delusion that we created, the delusion we created.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.630
 Create, we are not going to stay. We are going to come up there, come from there, come out of there

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:14.240
. That is known as path Dzogchens. Path Dzogchen also, as I said, to accumulate or to merit are

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.000
 completed.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 Dzogchen is not something that can be singly out of things. All two merits are completed. Akummele

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.000
hi merit. What are the two merits? Again, what is Akummelehi merit?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.820
 The all the activities that we do with beautiful motivations. Those are named in the Buddha

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.000
 teaching activities of the six parabolas. All those are known as Akummelehi merit.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 There is something, there is a subject, an object, an action, really good motivation when you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 perform six parabolas practices. All that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.840
 All the activities we use, precisely these, the first three parabolas. Generosity, morality,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.000
 patient parabolas are the example of the Akummelehi merit practices.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.070
 And they are also concentrated too, concentrated. And the worst of the parabola is the worst of the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.000
 merits, worst of the merits.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And what is the fourth parabola? The joyful effort. It is supported to both all parabolas.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.990
 We know the joyful effort, we want to progress, we want to develop it. We want to develop, we want

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:47.000
 to progress, we want to perform the generosity, morality, innovation, and concentration.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.070
 So therefore, as well as the worst of the parabola, therefore, joyful effort is the support to

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.000
 everyone. It is like fuel, fuel to move every parabola.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 So, the sixth parabola encompasses two Akummelehi merits, worst merit and Akummelehi merits.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.220
 Now, with that understanding, with that understanding, Zocchi practices, what we are practicing, in

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:26.000
 the Zocchi level, the worst of the parabola is known as Teju practices and Toga practices.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.640
 So, Teju and Toga are according, generally Buddhism, Buddha's terminology in Mahayana is worst of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.000
 the parabolas.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.910
 Now you are practicing, worst of the parabolas. And this parabola is directly, as I said, revealing

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.000
 the ultimate nature of our own quality, beautiful quality of the Buddha nature.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Not just immediately, conceptual level practicing this and that. Immediately you really discover,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.200
 for that reason, Zocchi Teju, the other Zocchi Teju is what we always say, is that Zocchi is beyond

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.000
 the mind, beyond the conception.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.310
 Wisdom is beyond the conception. Immediately you are really discovering, connecting to that, beyond

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.240
 the conception level of the realization, exactly as Buddha, Guru Pya Mahasam Bhagavat, Greater Mah

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.000
asat Panchi Bhagavat are realizing.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.170
 We are immediately connected to that, immediately through the skillful means of the teaching. We

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.000
 are connected to that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.080
 Even though we are connected there, our duration of the connected there is so small for us at the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.000
 beginning, or many of us, maybe I shouldn't say us, maybe many of us, is so small.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.740
 We connected there for short, maybe few seconds or minutes or something, then completely kind of

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.970
 again, interrupted by our old mundane habit of patience, force that we kind of running as a

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.000
 believer, current, that completely blocked that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.870
 Therefore, what in the teaching is it? Keep the joyful effort, keep the devotions, keep the poor

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.210
 renunciation towards those thoughts, really inspire yourself every day, not just kind of keeping up

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.000
 those things, eat well, keep bringing everything to the crazy stage.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.870
 If we don't have the devotion, if we don't have the poor renunciation, or the portraying of the

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.930
 mind, our practice becomes vague, vague, vague, what kind of become dull, and maybe it started with

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.520
 good, what insight, motivation, oh wow, wonderful, this is so good, I like to do this and that

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.000
 things.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.090
 But then time goes, kind of fading away, fading away, gradually become kind of fading away, fading

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.970
 away, and then it feels low, it's not that important, oh I am doing this, even some kind of those

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.440
 people can think of that, in completely complicated way, and went to the road, or write different

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:59.000
 talk, talk of the road, F-O-R-K, talk of the road, when it represents that.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.080
 Those who are known as the Buddha's teaching and the teaching of the GURUPEEM are some obstacles,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.080
 obstacles, this is not supposed to be moved, those people made the smart moves, it is obstacle

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.000
 movements, obstacle, heading to the samsara.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.720
 The samsara, heading to the dull life to change that, students are not avoided with those things,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.570
 the devotions, both each other, the poor renunciation, the poor portraying of the mind, and we

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:37.170
 activated those things, our practice becomes always like fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, it

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.000
 really becomes so beautiful, wonderful.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.260
 Every day is beautiful, every day is new life, everything is just so precious, beautiful, it is

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:54.240
 like teaching, it is reminding, reminding, never going to fail in the wrong direction, and never

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.000
 discourage it, and moving always stronger and stronger.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.640
 Those who are known as the Buddha's teaching, known as warriors, they are the warriors, they are

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.570
 really winning over the delusion of all that of old, mundane, unnecessary habit patterns, they are

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.000
 winning from that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.390
 And then we are repeating the negative emotions, negative emotions and obscurations, and then they

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:27.060
 get the victorious, they gain the victorious, that is what Buddha and GURUPEEM are similar to what

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.000
 Ahad has named the one who worked to respond.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 All that Ahad is known as the one who defeated the enemies of all of them.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So with those days, then we practice the Togat, the Surya Tyutu.
