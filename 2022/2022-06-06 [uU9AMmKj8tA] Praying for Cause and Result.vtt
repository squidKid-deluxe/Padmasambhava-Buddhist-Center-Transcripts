00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It is very excluded, very convoluted. We love ourselves. We love our clothes associated with us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 And with the others are less, less, and the part is kind of ridiculous. That is like we have the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.000
 separations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 That is, of course, is complicated. It's a law. It's so special. But it is not enough.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.350
 It's because man is connected with ego, self-emotional, deep dong, self-emotional, deep dong, self-

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.000
emotional,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.670
 self-sentence man, and ego. That's not going to go far. We had that all the time, according to the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.000
 teaching.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.270
 From the beginning of the time, we had that hope, kind of like screwed with thinking, what we

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.000
 achieved.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Still we are struggling. Still we can't be like all this. So many challenges go on and on.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.330
 We are clashing between all that, these emotions. Really, all the time. Even the external looks so

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.000
 good, perfect,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 nice job, nice hours, nice place, and nice training, all these things. Oh, many times we stop.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.300
 What is that? Someday is missing. What is missing? We did not ever take care of our own mind or our

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.000
 own heart.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 That's really the 100% answer, according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 We take care of our mind. Maybe that external looks maybe not so comfortable, but they are so happy

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.000
.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.710
 They are hard of singing. Happy, joy, breathing, and devotion. And those great masters stay in a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.000
 cave,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 a cold cave, up like 17, toward a pit at a Jewish city, and there are so many ice circles.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.380
 Ice circles. Circles, maybe, and singing the songs. Singing the song of joy and appreciation, and,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.000
 and,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.270
 and devotion. Really. Why that happened? They are not still so brave and tired and can't be like

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.000
 completely become not in the crazy.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 No. So wonderful. So beautiful. How these are? That tells us that every walk with our good nature,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.300
 then it really brings the capabilities out. We have all had the best part of the capabilities, but

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.000
 it's trained and trapped by ego.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 It's all habit-breath, accelerated. So for that reason, then bodhicitta is so important here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 And then first is the bodhicitta has a truth. Bodhicitta here is reaching bodhicitta and actual

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.000
izing bodhicitta.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 You all know that. So this first group is the reaching bodhicitta, and that is poor, boneless.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.330
 The training of the poor, boneless. May all beings have the happiness and the cause of the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.000
 happiness.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.670
 I mean, all this is the reaching bodhicitta. So then, of course. And so that's it. And then that is

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.000
 why.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.240
 First is, is poor, boneless. So what is the first one? First, may all beings have the happiness and

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.000
 the cause of the happiness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 That is boneless, loving kindness. Boneless, loving kindness.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.290
 Secondly is, may all beings be free from suffering and cause of suffering. That is boneless

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.000
 compassion.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Compassion has no boundaries, no limitation. Loving kindness has no boundaries, no limitation.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.270
 All the living beings, as I say, say here. And sometimes in the T.J. say, all mother living beings,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.000
 all mother living beings,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 prefer from suffering, called suffering. All mother living beings, they always have the happiness

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and cause of happiness.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.640
 So at this time, pray for us. The fourth, we are praying, that all living beings are free, so may

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.000
 all living beings have the happiness.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 That is, we pray, happiness. And then we pray, cause of happiness.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 The happiness people, when you get that it's not just happening without any cause and conditions.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.310
 That really the cause of happiness is cause. For really it is reason to be happy. There is some

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.000
 cause.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.880
 So that is what really we pray. So that means, in the T.J. open, you pray for the cause and the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.000
 result.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Cause and the result. You pray to have the result, for same day you pray to continue to have cause

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 to be happy, to be joy.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.540
 That's so powerful. It's a big mantra. Really, big mantra. Of course, we've heard this teaching so

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.000
 many times.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.380
 We chime this prayer, can it become so casual? But reality, great master, can't give what he's

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.000
 hearing many times.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.030
 This is mantra. Mantra is so special. It's so powerful. A really sincerely thin, reflected mind in

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.000
 this meaning.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.040
 Tell me this. This, how wonderful. This has no boundaries, no limitations, no restraint by ego

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.000
 claiming that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And then second is compassion. Again, every living will be free from suffering.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.540
 But free from suffering, they have to have some cause to be free from suffering. So, praying for

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.000
 the cause that will eliminate the suffering.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 May all living be free from suffering, call of suffering.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:33.090
 And what is cause of suffering? Cause of suffering is ego claiming, negative emotions, anger,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:40.000
 jealous, hate talk, and doubt, ignorance.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.810
 Those are the cause of suffering. One is the cause of happiness. Cause of happiness is joy, peace,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.000
 happiness, and loving kindness.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:12.130
 And having those really more respect and appreciation. And we have those in our heart. Definitely,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.000
 we can see. Don't have to ask anyone. We will be happy. We will walk calm, peaceful.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 We can witness by ourself.
