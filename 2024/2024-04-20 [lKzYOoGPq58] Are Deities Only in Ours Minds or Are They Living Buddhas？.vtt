00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 Thank you for watching. I have a question about deities. You mentioned in your amazing teaching

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 today about talking princes Amitabha, and you said how if we look to our mind, then there is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.930
 discriminating awareness, wisdom, Amitabha, but that doesn't mean that the actual living Amitabha

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.000
 is not there too. They are individual Buddhas.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.530
 So I love that. That's easy for me to be with. But in the so-called West, many people really don't

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.330
 believe there's these other Buddhas. It's just a common belief. So I was wondering how not

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.000
 believing in them, how that will affect togal practice.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 No, but the togal practice is really discovering our inherited Buddha. So I don't just really

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.000
 affect too much. I believe that because this is really like Amitabha. We discover our Amitabha.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 Togal practice is really discovering our inherited Amitabha. So I don't really affect too much.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 Definitely. Yeah. I don't think so. Yeah.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.530
 I say that the living Buddha Amitabha is really living Buddha. Of course, believe it or not,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 believe it. Those people who like to go to the next destination, next destination, if they like to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.000
 go in the pure land of Amitabha, if they don't believe, then they won't go there.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.530
 That's right. That is really my suggestion. Because in the Buddha teaching, generally, there are so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.200
 many pure lands that in the modern times, they discover also so many universes too. Before, maybe

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.000
 people would think only this world.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.800
 And now this telescope and physics are discovering more universes, more galaxies. Even I heard that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.000
. I mean, you all know better than me, me, but so many.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.400
 And so we don't believe, it doesn't mean that there's not existing. It's just only our belief. Our

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.000
 belief is best with our understanding and knowledge. Our knowledge in the wisdom is very limited.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.240
 And so what the Grand Master Dharmakati said in the teaching, he said, "If you don't, if it didn't

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:53.810
 me, if it didn't me, there is not, if you didn't see. If you didn't see, if it didn't me, there is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.000
 not existing."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.210
 So it's true. And there's so many things that we don't see in that. And also, now really, the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:14.070
 discovery, even other day, Lorraine read something or something, she said that one, one sent it,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.000
 she's talking now, now, of course, now everyone in modern science, they say the brain has all the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 chemicals of the mind or whatever that.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.430
 But she read the other day, and this man is saying, "They're not just the only brain, they proved

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:41.020
 that heart has some similar, similar chemicals or whatever that is, particles in the heart too,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.000
 what the brain has, has, because they proved, proved, I mean, brain stopped something and still

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 something is functioning because the heart really is mentioned."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.300
 And I thought that maybe now they're discovering it. In Buddhism, I believe in the teaching, so in

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.230
 Buddhism, the principles place of the mind stay, place of the mind is really the heart, and then

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.000
 brain is a kind of office, office.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.830
 So that's what the teaching says. So that, okay, thank you, everyone, thank you, thank you, thank

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:32.000
 you, everyone. We'll give you a few minutes of meditation in that day to get the meds.
