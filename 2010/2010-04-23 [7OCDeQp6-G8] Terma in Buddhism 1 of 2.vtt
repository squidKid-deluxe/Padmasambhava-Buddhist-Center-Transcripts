00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 There is one of the very extraordinary lages in the monument of the Angoropeama Sammung that he

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.640
 really loved that, and as well as the post-Western Dakini, and so on.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.490
 So it's a very extraordinary kind of gift and a specialist of the Nyingma schools of the Tibetan

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.600
 Buddhism.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.610
 However, even though it is like that, it's not just only Nyingma as that, but even in the Buddha's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.560
 time and in India, those great masters, many revert the terma teachings.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.720
 Even they don't give the name, call that name or title as terma, they revert many terma teachings.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.900
 For example, great master Dada Arjuna revert the Pandya Paramada teaching or 100,000 strength Pand

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.500
ya Paramada teaching, is also the Nyangma teaching, literally is the Nyangma teaching, from Nagaland

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.880
.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.910
 And then Asaenga, great master Asaenga, also is called the teachings of the material, the Peter-B

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:15.320
uddha material, but in a way, it is called that Asaenga is called from the Shiddha heaven.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.990
 And as well as many of those masterdas, many revert the terma teaching one after another, but

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:31.740
 however, they ignore the true stories, and then they don't say that it's kind of underneath

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 currents, they don't say that.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 But even though that is then, the terma is so powerful, so powerful, so strong, as we said, is the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.190
 one of the most powerful lages, lages in the monument of the Gurba Amma, some of us, where to

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.080
 benefit for the sentient beings, aspiring there to the enlightenment,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.820
 to remove the obstacles, diseases, sicknesses, for full of riches, as we said, so it is acting

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.800
 ongoing, the actions of the Gurba Amma sambhava and the Western definition.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:24.850
 And as you can see, the Gurba Amma is the one of the most powerful lages in the Gurba Amma, the one

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:33.400
 of the most powerful lages in the Gurba Amma.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.180
 The terma is the one of the most powerful lages in the Gurba Amma, the one of the most powerful l

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.150
ages in the Gurba Amma, the one of the most powerful lages in the Gurba Amma, the one of the most

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.560
 powerful lages in the Gurba Amma.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.020
 And then, also, Bhadashakamali mentioned many times in Sutra and Tantra, the teachings, of those

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.170
 who have high realizations, the Dharma is not kind of like a divided Dharma, it's not just kind of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.240
 like, kind of limited.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:17.550
 The true teaching is ongoing, the voice, ongoing song. If you have the cover bullet, if they have

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.800
 the realization, anywhere you can reveal, there is ongoing message, that's what are they called,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.680
 music is an A, you just have to pull down like that, that's what they call it, if music is an A,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.320
 you have to pull down.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.100
 If you have the cover bullet, everywhere that music of the great teaching is, at every level, level

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.220
 and you just pull, but to pull, you have to have the skill, technique, cover bulletess, any way to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.570
 maintain, preserve, up to think that is the quality, is the integrity, that is the all about of how

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.560
 the individual is maintained in those great masters.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.280
 And for that reason, for example, at Mahasadas or at Vidyadhara, also just called at Heruk teaching

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:12.400
, at the Sarvasa, or the kulguru, that is, even though don't call dharma, but it is dharma.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.370
 So the personal dakini, Lady Whamu, handed that to them, then. So it is in the dharma teaching. And

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.210
 then in the peak of the Malaya mountain, the five vidyadhara, again, received, where Japan, and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.420
 handed those teachings, or in a way, give the teaching to the five vidyadhara, or five excellent v

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.960
idyadharas, dharas, and that is dharma, dharma teachings, even though don't call them, but however,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.160
 dharma is this in that way.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.470
 Dharma is ongoing, beneficial activities that inspire others, and inspire them, and then bring

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.880
 everyone to their ordinary natural status. That is all about of this dharma teachings.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:38.390
 And then, similarly, the great master Chati Deva said, at the end of his teaching, the light of the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.780
 wind, the light of the body itself, and then he said, may always reveal the teaching even from the

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.180
 sky, may all the time, he prayed that, that pray, that means, also there is possible, possible,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.000
 that's why we pray, it is not something we pray, something is not impossible, impossible.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.940
 When we pray, it is possible, and that is also ushering, and when you put mind to the power, to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:56.770
 that direction, it will come. That is also one way, that, so there is the dharma, that's generally

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.200
 the kind of idea of dharma teaching.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:11.260
 And then, particularly, this dharma is a very special legacy, extra-old legacy of the baroque amma

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:18.750
 sambhava, and that is then blessed by many of those great masters, and inspired, they have the

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.310
 cover of the letter to did all these things, many schools of Tibetan Buddhism, particularly, of

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.640
 course, for miyuma, and then as well as from Gaju's tree.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.980
 And so, this is what, again, here, in particular, those who are, who have the cover of the letter

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.370
 to reveal the dharma teaching, but having some difficulties, trouble, and then, kind of having

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.640
 difficulties, at that time, if you pray, then you will be well.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:07:01.010
 And the great master. See, this is mainly for the tetrong, the tetrong, that whoever, they had some

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.640
 difficulty, that time, that should pray.
