00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone, again for coming, and welcome.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.200
 Welcome, everyone, again. We are now all again together and discussing the teachings of the great

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 teacher,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.600
 Mother Shatyamuni, other great Masters. So I'm very, very happy and thankful for all the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.560
 good with this subconscious situation both, even though it is very difficult and hard and strange,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.520
 but yet we are doing meaningful of this situation. So I'm thankful that it's great. Thank you.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 Again,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.480
 with this, again, as we, you know, and we should remember, back to our best, best of foundational

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.400
 practices, remembering our beautiful motivation, so activating our motivations of the joy and

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.760
 appreciation, and both each other, and then purely realization or understanding of the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:19.520
 s, where we are teaching, always taught and teaching. So we reflect on those. We were taught,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.760
 and then we again go to the teaching. And this time, teaching is now, I'm going to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:36.480
 read it again, this booklet, that you all have, this one. And now,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.720
 we've discussed about what we've been discussing. We've been discussing

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.680
 about the poor renounceations or poor point that will change in the mind. That is essence, the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:02.690
 teaching of the great teacher, Mother Shatyamuni, first to see. Suffering truth and cause of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.120
 suffering

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.720
 truth. It is a very, very essence, also is a very practical way, how to reflect in that.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.920
 Those are important, and so necessary, the teaching said, this poor point of the mind,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.640
 or the poor renounceation thought, it is so important because it will help us, our practice

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 goes on the right directions. And we don't have these poor points of this thought or the poor

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:47.440
 renounceation. Many times, our practice of dharma will go according to worldly concerns,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.480
 at worldly concerns. You all know those at worldly concerns. At worldly concerns, that means we're

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 diluting our practice with samsara, mundane attitudes. Therefore, always those in the practice

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.600
 lineages emphasize of reflecting of this poor point or poor renounceations. Again, it is the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:28.480
 essence of the past true, noble truth, among the poor. Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.360
 is a very strong word. Once we have that understanding thought, then we follow the path.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:47.040
 Among the following of truth, then we follow the path truth. That's the way, path truth is the way

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:56.320
 to get the realization of the cessation state, or truth of cessation. So that's what it really is.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.160
 So now, path truth. When you follow the path truth, then always in the Buddha teaching,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.480
 mention how important to take the raffod. And we like to pursue the teaching of the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.720
 great teaching of the Buddha khatamali. Following all those great masters and practitioners,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.040
 that's the way we should take raffod. Raffod is so important, entirely Buddha's teachings.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.120
 Teachings, particularly all the moralities, ethics are best upon raffod.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.600
 Without the raffod, there is no vows. There is no vows of Bhaskar, no vows of the uni practices,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:58.240
 all the uni practices, no vows of the share mandala, whether male or female, and no vows of the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.720
 monk, and all non-fully or any. And then some bodhisattva vows, mva, vediyana vows,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.800
 all that is best upon on these raffod. So therefore, we discuss about the raffod.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.800
 And in order to get the raffod, how we accept, if we don't, we need the devotions or the peds

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.000
 to tell the raffod. If we don't have the devotions on the peds, how we should aspire?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.280
 Devotions on the peds is in the great master. Yimul Nambased is the most humble sleeping beauty.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.400
 Most of the time, it just stays, and the mental state is not really acting.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.320
 But we have to activate it. To activate it, I mentioned pour different. That says to activate

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.760
 the devotee. These pours are not necessarily all the pour you need, but one of those.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.360
 And particularly, reading the teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:17.840
 leading the lives of those great masters, and then accompanying really good practice groups,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:26.560
 good spiritual friends, good spiritual friends of also teachers, qualified teachers.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:35.280
 And then, when you're reflecting pour in all certain thoughts only, then those four,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.080
 these four of them, or two of them, three of them, or one of those,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.360
 they will activate our peds. That is all turning the mind to the dharma,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:57.680
 trying to turn the mind to the spirituals. So that is what we need. This devotion or the peds

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:08.560
 is not just one game of the once time, one time game. We need that continuous every day we need,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:18.240
 every practice, every day. Therefore, we have to inspire. This peds goes up and down for many

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:26.560
 times to for many of us. It's kind of almost like weather. It goes up, it goes down. For that

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.440
 reason,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.640
 great verse from Daki Nishi, in her prayers, "May I never have the ups and the don'ts,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 no change of the devotees, stay so firm and strong as the willing and the sun in the sky."

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:48.880
 She really said, "I'm true." This is what we all go through, ups and the don'ts.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:57.360
 But therefore, once the dawn's time, we have to inspire. We have to pray. We read the lives

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:06.560
 of those great masters. Even they are so highly beloved beings, they are practicing. Even Buddha

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:16.080
 reached enlightenment within his life time, or within that he is enlightenment. Still, he merited.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:25.760
 In a teaching said, or in a chakra, or Vinaya teaching, Buddha goes with monk, or monk with

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.120
 audience or his disciples to the city to get the food. Once that kind of attack completed,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:41.280
 and returned back to his hermitage, and wipe his feet, and then merited, and practiced.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:52.080
 Even Buddha, these are the good examples, examples. These are also examples of our inspirations.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.640
 They are all examples. And we have to keep up. Buddha is totally enlightened beings.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.840
 There's nothing higher realization you can get than the Buddha. But even that,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.680
 Buddha is doing it. At the same time, when you, same way with the life story of the

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:23.920
 Guru, when he came to Tibet, he's already enlightened, or not just yet, already enlightened.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.080
 He's the emanation of the Buddha Amitabha, the living Buddha Amitabha,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:38.000
 and the reincarnation of the Buddha Shapta Manus. But when he came to Tibet, for example,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.200
 in every sources, wherever Masambha most of the time stayed on the hermitage mountains,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.880
 in the mountains, caves. Therefore, throughout the Tibet, there are so many caves

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.760
 that are blessed by the wherever Masambha, and meditating, practicing.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.240
 That's all tests. And they read the life story of all the other great masters up there. Really,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:15.200
 even though we have high still realization. So therefore, we, for us, for many of us,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.280
 and I'm not going to say we, but equally that, for many of us, maybe just beginner practitioners.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:30.560
 Therefore, we need faith. We need devotion. We need courage. We need commitment.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:40.000
 We may need determination. We need more relaxed, calm, and peaceful. Follow the rhythms of those

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:51.760
 great masters. What they did there in life story, and what they taught in a book that we can read,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.990
 which is, as I said, so many now in Ignis, or in the language, different countries, their own

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.040
 language.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.240
 Read those. Those are the living representatives of those great masters.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.080
 Buddha's teaching is also known as living representatives of the Buddha Shapta Manus.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:22.080
 So, read. And apply that. This is not what Buddha or those great masters reserved, can't

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.960
 really tell, and told you, or private corners, private clubs. This is the message and teaching,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:39.680
 that sharing how we can do, because we all equally inherited the nature, Buddha nature.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:49.120
 Therefore, we have 100% responsibilities to welcome ourselves now. It is a border town, too.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.600
 According to the teaching of the British graduate teacher, Buddha Shapta Manus,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.680
 we've been so long in samsara. From the beginning, this time in the teaching,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:08.800
 there is no, even the country can put the numbers of years. The eons who went through this samsara

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:20.560
 challenges. And now, if we don't make the change or stop, it will be continued, according to the

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:29.360
 teaching of the Buddha. Because duality construction is endless, there is no ending of the negative

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:37.840
 emotions. I don't know where it's coming. It's from somewhere coming. There is no really shortage

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:46.000
 of negative emotions. We can read that ourselves. Even though we can trace our negative emotions,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.960
 anger, attachment, jealousness, arrogance, or those things, we cannot trace and pinpoint the

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:07.440
 source. Yet, this is endless. When it is coming endlessly, it creates an endless dilemma,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:21.680
 endless chaos, endless challenge, endless dissatisfaction, endless boring and attire.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:34.000
 There is no end. Since, we didn't put the bread to our duality mind. Who is going to do that?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.400
 We are going to do it ourselves. Buddha is not going to do it. Buddha himself clearly said,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:51.520
 "I showed you the path." Or, "I showed you the path." Or, "I showed you the technique." Now is your

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.040
 time. Whether

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:03.520
 you like to apply or not apply. We have the right. What will we do? We have to do. Buddha taught us

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:10.640
 the skills and methods. Great Master also taught all the skills and methods. And they followed with

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:19.840
 teaching of the Buddha. They had all those big differences. They are the witness. They are the

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:28.640
 witness. We can do. We can do. For that reason, what in the teaching said, in the Dharma Path,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:36.640
 Dharma Path Buddha said, "You are your protector." Who will really finally be going to protect us?

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:45.760
 Ourself has to protect ourselves. And we don't protect ourselves. What is that? Again, in the same

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:54.660
 line in the Dharma Path said, "You are your enemy." Now you are, can be the worst enemy to yourself

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.800
.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:06.080
 You can be the best protector to yourself or yourself. It's true. Many times, all these

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:14.400
 troubles we go through, ours have to create it. We can see. How much help? All those mental

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.440
 creations

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:23.120
 have a dependence. All that we completely, kind of like, create it and then it becomes

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:32.080
 out of control. Nobody put our Lord in those reality levels. Even though we say, "Oh, that must be,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:38.560
 kind of, is created by that and these things." But those may be consequence. Reality is our.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:46.880
 We have to bounce back ourselves. We cannot blame to someone else all the time. But that

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:55.040
 don't really solve the problems. We have to solve the solution. We have to solve the problem.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.800
 Blame someone, talking to someone that will not solve the problem. Baby is emotional level a little

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:13.520
 bit, but that is not the solution. And therefore, as a gracious teacher, brother said, "You are

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:13.760
 your

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:22.000
 protector or best protector or you are the worst your enemy." It's true. That's it. So therefore,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.800
 this, for that reason, then we follow the path. Truth. Part truth and then we follow

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.800
 part truth and we take reference. And those I went quite determined. And of course, you can find

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.120
 more

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:47.360
 about this reference, the reference practices and many teachings. All such as all my perfect

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.160
 teachers

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.480
 or the dual ornament of the great Gumbo White teachings and all those really teachings explaining,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.920
 so following, so detailed, so that we like to know. But what I said is more condensed,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:09.600
 essential meanings. Once you turn now, rafu, now where we have to go? We have to now continually

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:17.520
 follow the path. As I said the other day, taking rafu is the first steps of our in the path

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:26.320
 to the liberation or the path truths. From that on, we begin to the beginning process of

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:34.720
 changing samsara to the nirvana. That is what it is. So we take reference. After we take rafu,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:44.000
 then here, here, what this is again, in the teaching, said here, here, so then

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:55.120
 said here. And this is now the, I think seventh line. Seventh line is and, and so if I read that

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:02.320
 what we kind of been going to go on over this meaning, trust that the three jewels and the

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:11.440
 imperishable source of rafu. And then, and do not be mistaking about the result of the rituals

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:20.320
 and unrighteous actions. So that is what, but this, from this line and as well as here, this, this,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.600
 this line and next line in particular devoted to the root teacher and then love and natural faith,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.080
 love and affection for the samayam and the brothers and sisters, the bodhijata of

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:43.760
 competing to all mother sending beings, component things are in permanent and the end and should be

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:57.440
 regarded as inseparable in, in, in this, in, in, yeah, and unknown as forever lost wealth of the

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:05.360
 practicing. Sorry, I'm thinking mixed up lines, component things are impermanent and, and unknown

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:15.520
 as the poor ever lost wealth of the practitioners. Now these practices, this is this all, all these

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:23.200
 teachings, all these lines and stockings and stockings of these lines, we have to keep all the time

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.200
.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:34.560
 This is not just once in a while, as in the teaching said, he said, for wealth of the

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:46.000
 practitioners, or what, how they translated here, the unknown as the forever lost wealth of

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:57.360
 practitioners, ever lost wealth of the practitioners. That means this wealth, we need all the time,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:07.600
 this, these points, or they are the wealth. They are the wealth because if you have this wealth

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:15.440
 of the, understand these things, what is listed teaching, we are the practitioners, we are the

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:24.880
 really very good practitioners, all very fine practitioners. Why we don't have, we are the

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:33.610
 poor practitioners, we are not rich practitioners. So that indicating we, we like to be really

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.720
 wealthy

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:44.880
 practitioners of all the trails, or you like to be poor practitioners and always trying to apply

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:52.960
 what was bankruptcies, bankruptcies of the practice in town. Now I don't know where you can apply

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.120
 it.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:03.120
 At least we can use the names. So if we don't have that, we really don't have that, we have enough.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:11.920
 So therefore, how we can get this wealth again is not coming from outside. We are opening our own

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:20.560
 treasure of knowledge and our own, from the mind, nature of the mind, that this we really need.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:31.680
 And we have that, truly we are advancing on the part. And then the sensations are coming.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.440
 Actually, sensation is, if I translated the sensation in another way,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:48.000
 relaxation. Relatation is not just coming only in later. Relatation is coming when we have this

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.440
 wealth. When we have those wealth, it's really at the same time. It's growing, it's arising,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.160
 developing.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:07.120
 Therefore, this wealth, relaxation or the sensation is all the Sangha members of every part.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:17.840
 Part, accumulation part. Relatation was sensation of truth is also within the mind or heart of the

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.200
 accumulation part. Sensation through the realization is also education, Sangha members of

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:33.120
 education part. And the sensation, truth or the realization is heart or the mind of the

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.920
 same part. And then, of course, meditation part. But the point and the best is then

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:48.800
 have normal, starting sensation, which is the Buddha. That is the best. But otherwise,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:59.200
 realization comes where we are advancing on the part. The moment we advance that,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:07.280
 it's really coming. So therefore, if we keep this part that, that is, and this is here,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:16.000
 here, and do not mistakenly about the result and virtues, unvirtuous action, this teaching is,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.800
 we already discussed last week, last week or this time, we discussed about karma. This is teachings

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:32.000
 on the karma. Cause and effectiveness are inevitable. So this teaching is teachings

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.160
 on the karma. But what is really, and that, what is really cause of the non-virtuous?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:54.480
 Or unvirtuous? What is the cause of unvirtuous? It's again our negative emotions. Negative emotions

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:54.560
,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:01.760
 generally, which go very passively, it has to become negative emotions. Gross negative emotions

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:12.480
 and subtle negative emotions. Gross negative emotions is such as anger, attachment, jealous.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:22.240
 Those are gross negative emotions. Subtle negative emotions, which is ignorance.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:32.560
 Ignorant is so subtle, we don't recognize. Otherwise, according to the teaching, why we get anger?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:40.480
 Because of ignorance. Why we get jealous? Because of ignorance. Why we get attachment?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:48.400
 Or greedy? Because of ignorance. But ignorance is subtle. It's hidden.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.160
 Ignorant is saturated to all these negative emotions.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:03.680
 Behind this, so it is the vital in a way. Ignorant is vital, keeping all those active.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:15.040
 And then of course, ignorance is the vital cause of ego cleanings. But that all hidden in a way.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.960
 So therefore, some of the teaching mentions gross and subtle emotions.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:31.520
 So that these negative emotions are, when it comes to the activity. As I said the other day,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:40.640
 and of course you all know, it is known as unvirtuous. It started with the unvirtuous

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:50.800
 intention. It reacted, reacted, unwholesome for disturbances. Disturbance to one's own self,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:26:00.880
 and disturbance to the others. And one in the credit, the result is unpleasant. Sad, suffering,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:13.040
 scaring, depression. All those we name really come. These are not just again stories of mythology

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:21.520
 telling that. We all experience ourself. We are in the dead of those emotions. Our mind becomes

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.080
 restless.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:34.800
 We are not subtle. Even we cannot sleep. Those happen. Difficult sleep. So that means it disturbed

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:44.160
 all the system of the body too. Brain, body, channel, energy. Everything disturbed.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:54.400
 Within it is disturbing others the same way. And that is known as unvirtuous. That started from,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:04.320
 again, from the mind. Mind of emptiness. It started. And therefore, what in our way of teaching

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:14.880
 said, even though they are so disturbances, so kind of like obstacle, and I can't resist possible,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:23.040
 it's terrible. But yet, all this negative, ah, the nature of empty nature. Oh, it's not empty.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:31.360
 There's no solid existence of any negative emotions. It's all empty as everything.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:42.400
 Everything. That means no substantially solid entities of this negative emotions.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.680
 That's what the Buddha said. That's what all these great masters said. And that is something.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:57.840
 When we read this teaching, when we read the book, when we ask our own self, we witness, we prove.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:08.240
 That is realization. When we got that intellectually realization, that means we are something of

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:17.440
 cessation meaning. All the realization is true. There's no substantial existence.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:28.960
 And then same way. Where is this? The virtues come from. Again, same source. There's no different

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:35.760
 compartment of the mind. All this side is virtues coming. This side is coming with the unvirtuous.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.720
 Maybe on the channel, the nervous system level in the brain, modern scientists, they'll say,

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:49.520
 "Oh, but reality is from mind." A court of Buddhism. All come from the mind. But there's no

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:49.920
 different

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:57.840
 compartments of the mind. This is the virtuous side of the mind. This is the unvirtuous side

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:07.760
 of the mind. We never pound the mind. How we can say this side, that side. It's true. No one yet

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:16.000
 found the mind, even the modern scientists. Those high sophisticated, cutting machinery

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.560
 technology in the laboratories. Never found. Buddha never found. Nagarjuna never found.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:32.400
 Murugama Sambha never found. They don't have the machinery external, but they have the most

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:42.640
 highest sophisticated, the intelligence of the power of the mind. Mind. According to the Buddha's

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:52.960
 teaching, the power of the mind is much more stronger than the material and the substations.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:06.160
 Much more strong. Much more sophisticated. A trillion times more powerful than the machinery,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.200
 things highest. And on that machinery of the enlightened mind, never found.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:25.600
 So, therefore, there's no different compartment. But yet, it's arising the virtuous mind. What are

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:40.800
 those? Those are the loving kindness, compassion, and then non-detectments. Those are all non-det

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.280
ectments.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:53.920
 Those are all coming. We need calm in our mind. What it creates in our mind, in our brain? Calm,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:04.080
 peace. More calm and satisfying. Relax. And that, with that energy or that mind reflected to the

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:15.200
 external, it created same thing to the others. Bring calm, peace, joy, happiness. All that what we

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:24.160
 wanted, what we like to, it really brings that to everyone. And also recognized by that everyone.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.840
 There's no need for interpretations of the loving kindness and compassion.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:36.560
 Joy and appreciators. Even the animals recognize it. That is powerful truth

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:44.560
 of this way things are. So, that is a mystery. So, this is what He kept you doing. You said,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:54.240
 hold on that. Hold on that. Don't mistake. Do that. And this time, this is also teaching

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:01.440
 medias on the, again, as I said the other day, and you all know, when we practices, there is

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:11.040
 two periods. Post meditation and meditation periods. Practice time and not practice, or that

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.400
 means not meditating, sitting on the cushion and sitting on the chair or whatever, not cooking that

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:16.640
.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:24.080
 So, we are engaged outside. This is also instructions of the, in during post meditation too.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:30.400
 We should always thoughtful. Thoughtful. During the meditation or the practice,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:37.120
 suppose we are engaged in completely our self. Minds are completely in the, on the most positive,

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:43.760
 which is mind. But during the post meditation, we are interacting with the world. There's many

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.080
 things

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:53.120
 can happen. That time, then we have to be also keep up our identity, our principles.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:33:02.080
 Principles. So, that is a little instructive of this. In order to do that, what integrate Master

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.600
 Gungjima said in his teachings, and that which is not just only in Gungjima, and then everyone

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.320
 really

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:18.240
 after Gungjima highlighted that. Three principle noblities, if I translate that way. Many of you

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:27.360
 know already that. On that. But again, I'm going to repeat that. Three principle noblities.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.320
 Sometimes I translate this what I'm talking about, going from nobility or noble. I translate it

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:34.880
 good.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:43.680
 Three principle books. Sometimes I translate it virtues. But this I'm going to use the same

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:51.040
 meaning in the novel ladies. I don't know what that gradually goes on. But I'm going to use that.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:59.680
 Novelty. Three principle novel ladies. And what in the teaching said intubate, if I kind of try

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.440
 to say that intubate, so then maybe it's a little bit co-accurate. Sometimes I translate it to be

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:05.600
 the

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:12.960
 word in my brain and try to utter that. And then sometimes it comes a little bit okay, and

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.520
 sometimes

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:20.720
 not okay. So, now I will say that first intubate, and then I will translate at least that.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:44.240
 And if I translate that, first principle of the first novel lady is motivation.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:55.920
 Motivation or the foundation of the preparation. The first principle of the novel lady is

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.920
 motivation. So that is the first. And the second is

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:18.240
 and the principle, the principle, principle second or second principle novelty is, is

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:28.880
 meditation with no grasping. Meditation with no grasping. So that is second or the principle.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:40.480
 Middle. And the third is yo moa tamba. Yo moa tamba. And principle is

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:51.200
 sealing up the practice with dedication and aspirations. These are, these three are,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:36:01.360
 what great master Dung Kim says, they are so precious for all the practitioners

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:12.720
 that would really like to get realization. These three are the crucial. These three are so

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.280
 important.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:24.320
 So that way, the fourth one is motivation. Motivation, I always highlight in the three

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:36.640
 quiz. Joy and appreciation, and both each other. And then ready and realization, all the both each

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:45.840
 other. And that also includes joy and appreciation and taking a ruffle and both each other. These

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:54.400
 three are, or that is the beginning principle or the first novel lady of the principles.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:03.440
 That is what really the first one. So we should. And then I'm going to talk about this,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:12.410
 this, as well as connecting to this, this teaching, this teaching of jap ji dun yul moo ji, I will

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.640
 go

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:21.200
 over those slowly by the, slowly and next time. So that is my talk for today. And thank you very

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.880
 much for again for coming and participating. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you everyone.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:34.560
 Thank you. And then I think maybe this is still now too. Next three days, we won't have the session

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:34.560
.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:43.600
 Session. And so this is Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, we will not have the session.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:50.880
 Session, up in the sessions. We won't have up in the sessions. And also that during that three days

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:50.880
,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:58.880
 and we are going to have in the kind of, we change our technologies, technology, the internet,

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:06.480
 we're going to have really positive, positive and positive internet and private object,

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:21.040
 and internet. So then maybe we can zoom betterly each of us in the next week. So that time,

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.240
 then I see you. And under that really, I wish you all have good health and take care of yourself.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:34.880
 Thank you very much for participating. And then again, we continually and keep your practices,

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:42.800
 keep your also another good activities. And this is our this week, we are retreat, but we are in

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.800
 what called very soft retreat, or semi retreat status, which is wonderful. We can also let

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.600
 activate our kind of those practice, the teaching that we did zero involvement with is it so many

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.680
 years, so many times, we didn't really have time to my put in the practice, I just maybe sometimes,

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:09.440
 one week, 10 days, or one week, or two weeks, or one month or something like that, but not too much

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:09.440
.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:15.280
 But this time, really, we can spend a little more time to act with it. And this practice is really

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:21.280
 wonderful, wonderful. And then also with a good heart and a good mind, dedicated those merit for

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.440
