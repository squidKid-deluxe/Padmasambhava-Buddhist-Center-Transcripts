00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.350
 The highlight of this, again, is Dzogchen opening. Just go to the general Ngondro practice, a

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.400
 particular Ngondro practice, and then do the Dzogchen practice every time.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 That is really teaching. The general Ngondro practice is the general need. What general need? The

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 general Ngondro practice is the general to all the yanas.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.580
 When there is a Theravada, when there is a Suttur Mahayana, when there is a Dhanthur Mahayana, it

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.000
 is the same. That is what we call the general Ngondro.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.460
 This renunciation, thought, and discussion, what we are discussing, is basic Buddhist teaching,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.000
 foundation. That is what is called general Ngondro practice.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.570
 It is general. Why is it called general? Everyone is. Everyone in that practice, and you reactivate

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 in that practice.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.080
 And then, what is the general Ngondro practice? It is the Suttur Mahayana practice. That is not all

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.000
 general. It is Dzogchen along with that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 So, it is particular. And within the general Ngondro practice, what we call general Ngondro

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
 practice, extra ordinary Ngondro practice, even in the Ngondro practice.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Extra ordinary Ngondro practice there is then, it depends. It is generally also, according to Ngond

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.000
ro practice,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.900
 the general Ngondro practice is nothing mystery, nothing unusual things. Even the non-believer

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.000
 knows, or even they don't believe on Buddhism,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 this thought, you know, like a thought, definitely, is all, everybody, every experience. Everybody

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.000
 has to go through.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Whether they recognize or not recognize, it is basic, common ground, common nature.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.400
 Then, extra ordinary Ngondro practice, as we follow with the asalic, rafut, and bodhijanas. Those

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.000
 are the, it depends.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.240
 And generally, according to the Dzogchen level, all that is Ngondro practice. Everything is Ngondro

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 practice.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.670
 I mean, these, all generators are Ngondro practice. But according to the Theravada level, rafut is

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000
 the all general Ngondro practice.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 But according to everybody, whether you are Theravada, whether you are Mahayana, whether you are V

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.000
aidyan or Mahayana, all practices are taken up.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 And the bodhijada is then highlighted in the Mahayana. That is from Suttur Mahayana, all which is V

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.000
aidyan, is the same.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.070
 No distinct, no difference, no difference. That is the foundation of the Mahayana, whether it is S

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.000
uttur or whether it is Dandram Mahayana.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.230
 Then, Madala offering all those more connected to the Mahayana teachings. Vaidyan teachings, all

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.000
 that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So that is the halfway reason. So now, we are going kind of, going again, back to Edirhe.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.020
 And if you really appreciate our knowledge and understanding of our renunciations, in a way, just

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.000
 reminding, again, keep praying as I said.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.510
 In the preparation of our understanding, knowledge of the whole renunciations, we went really about

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.000
 the precious lives, impermanence, and then samsaras.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Today I talk really, again, about the, about the now karma.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Karma is that.
