00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 - Again, I restate our beautiful motivations,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.000
 and this motivation is the key,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.400
 what we want in the direction we like to do these practices.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400
 We have the beautiful motivation.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.600
 Every practices, every listen to the teaching,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.120
 reflect on the teaching,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 contemplate on the teaching,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 meditate on the practice of the teaching,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 it comes partly to the practice,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 the arm and the benefit to our self,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.640
 and the benefit to all beings.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.000
 So therefore, motivation is so, so important,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.160
 as we all know that.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.560
 So again, in a way, reactivated with the motivation,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 which is a joy and an application,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.560
 bodhicata and a purely understanding,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.840
 all the vegan organizations.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 Those motivation, whatever kind of, strongly maintained

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.120
 in the heart and mind,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.440
 and then we reflected on the teachings.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640
 Again, this teaching, the teaching of his (speaking in foreign

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.480
 language)

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.320
 or the (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.380
 teachings.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.420
 Teachings, and I'm going to go over this,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.120
 really, this teaching,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 and which you all have I believe is focus, focus.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.520
 And now, here, we are talking,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.960
 in the third port line in this teaching,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.200
 to take the full advantage,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.880
 to take the full advantage of the life

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.920
 that is so difficult to obtain,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.520
 and that what that means, take advantage,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.080
 because our life is in our hand,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.640
 our opportunity, particularly that we have to add freedoms,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.320
 entertain endowment or (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.080
 Since we have that full,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.840
 we have that full, everything in our hand,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560
 therefore, it's for that reason,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.720
 here, his (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.920
 reminding that we should take full advantage,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.920
 take meaningful of our lives.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.360
 And now, I want to take the meaningful lives,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.020
 again, as I mentioned two days ago,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.780
 when we started thinking of the how many times

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.780
 we already have time in one day, 24 hours.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.260
 So, take advantage means practicing,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.840
 practicing, so how much really we are practicing,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 every thinking of the 24 hours,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.840
 how much we practice with good heart,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.920
 how many times we practice.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.920
 As I mentioned, those people who are on the retreat,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.600
 maybe they spending 70% or 80% or maybe 60%, 7%, 7%,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 50% means how much, 12 hours in the day they practice.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.440
 That means practicing, whether they're meditating,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.680
 whether they're reciting or the sadhana practices.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.840
 Sadhana practices are more connected

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.800
 with the Vedayana teachings.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.120
 Meditation is very popular teaching of the Buddhism,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.480
 all Buddhism, calm and abiding,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.880
 all vibhajana meditations.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.880
 Both are practices, both are culturing and restrengthening,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.600
 glorifying our inner qualities of the true natures.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.680
 So, 12 hours means really quite good, a lot of time.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 That means 50% of the time of the 24 hours.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.200
 But every person, such as many of us,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.200
 maybe we are spending, practicing only 20%,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.800
 or maybe two hours, if we have a second hour level,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.080
 two hours, one and a half hours.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.960
 So that means, among the 24 hours,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.960
 we're practicing only two hours, and 22 hours,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.440
 we're not really practicing or doing mundane activities,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.720
 more with mundane activities,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.640
 including our sleeping or yes-ness, like that.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.160
 So that's what really the kind of,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.840
 we bring calm down to the more practical level

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.480
 and reflecting of time and how we're spending,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.720
 how we're doing this.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.480
 Which is wonderful, if we practice even two hours,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.000
 one and a half hours, it's really beautiful, it's wonderful.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.160
 But there is another skill that means

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.160
 the way to transform every aspect of time into practices.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.200
 That great teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni mentioned in teachings,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.920
 teachings that he told to the person,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.200
 King of Kosalas, or King of Sarasas.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.600
 He said to a great king,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.800
 "You have so many duties, jewels to do,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.320
 "and so many activities to do,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.360
 "but if you keep wanting in your heart,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.520
 "it will turn everything into the practices,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.200
 "into the dharma, dharma."

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.640
 And what is that?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.720
 That is bodhicam.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720
 What that is, again, if we say,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.440
 bodhicam, that every simple part of bodhicam is compassion.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.520
 If we have compassion in your heart,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.640
 mind, whatever activity you're performing or we're performing,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.400
 we're really transforming that into the dharma.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.000
 This is a similar statement Buddha made

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 to the great king of the Pasar,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.600
 Basajapur and Charsi in the teachings.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.640
 He said, "Now modern time is called koshambi,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.760
 "oh, ancient time too."

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.480
 He mentioned that too.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.640
 If you keep this compassion or the bodhicam in heart,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.800
 everything is transforming.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.000
 Whole activity is transforming into the practices.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.320
 So now that means every simple part of compassion,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.480
 what is known as in the common word, good heart.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.160
 Simple way, good heart.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.000
 That good heart is not something outside

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.520
 we have to get and go a far distance

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.720
 or we have to be rich to get that, to have got that.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.920
 We just, it's all our treasures.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.560
 We have to activate it.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.800
 When you have the great compassion or good heart in mind,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.840
 that individual is, if you really think of everything carefully,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.840
 that person is more calm, more peaceful, more mindfulness,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.440
 more down to the earth, more beautiful common sense.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.680
 Where that all come from is from the compassion,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.840
 from the good heart.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.600
 Compassion or good heart or the bodhicata

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.440
 is foundation of the entire Buddha teachings.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.680
 And compassion and the bodhicata is also nature of our mind.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.440
 And we like to get enlightenment.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.400
 Open in the Dzogchi teachings we can get enlightenment

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.840
 within these lifetimes or Mahamudra teachings.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.640
 Those teachings, it's true, you can get enlightenment.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.160
 According to the teachings, you can get enlightenment

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.680
 within this lifetime.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.680
 But every lack of compassion, every lack of bodhicata,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.160
 even when applying Dzogchi teachings,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.160
 apply the Mahamudra teachings, we won't go that far.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.160
 They call it again teachings.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.840
 So therefore, every lack to make more powerful,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.240
 more magnificent, more meaningful, more simplified,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.160
 and the good heart, the compassion,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.840
 bodhicata is a ground.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.400
 And we have that, we're taking the full advantage

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.480
 of meaning of our these precious lives.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And also benefited to the others, benefited to ourself.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.320
 We become more kinder, more gentle, more peaceful.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.200
 This is not just a Buddha taught and we just can't

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.320
 because he said, we believe in that.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.320
 We can make that again, we can witness ourself.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.520
 We need more compassion and kindness.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.200
 We are more calm and peaceful, more gentle,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.160
 more satisfied, more happiness,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.640
 really all the beautiful situations.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.560
 All this comes to show, this is a good.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.720
 This all comes by simple things, compassion.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.680
 So now, with this understanding, with great compassion,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.640
 with great loving kindness, every other great compassion

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.680
 of bodhicata, bodhicata also is a great healing power.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.000
 In the teachings, it's the most powerful healing,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 healing tools to heal the emotional scar,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.720
 physical scar, or troubles, or mental troubles,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.320
 as well as all this spontaneous disease.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.760
 All this really can be purified with good heart

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.400
 and bodhicata, not just only purify our sickness

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.360
 but it's benefited for others.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.160
 We say, we have that beautiful love and configured thought,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.040
 we filled with beautiful energy, beautiful vitality.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.400
 It will fill our beautiful immune systems,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.760
 really seething up that our immune systems,

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.880
 repressing our immune systems,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.560
 that was defended all unwanted in those disease sicknesses.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.680
 This compassion is more than a hundredth ton

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.720
 or a thousandth ton, more powerful than multiple vitamins.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.640
 Definitely, many levels.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.960
 Many levels.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.200
 This is our own resources.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.520
 We have all this.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.280
 Then, that way, we take full advantage

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.720
 of the meaning of our precious lives.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.160
 Now, with this understanding, again,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.160
 I talked a little bit about this here in the teachings.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:52.120
 With those thoughts, and now, what is this?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.120
 So, now, I will move to the people, people always.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.440
 Resolve to free oneself from the oaken

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.480
 of the samsara of sufferings.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.640
 And we like to go out of the samsara tabals.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.600
 Or we like to transform our samsara tabals

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 into the great peaceful, happiness,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.960
 and more sufferings, it becomes as blissful and comfortable.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.480
 That is what we have to do.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.400
 Again, according to the teachings,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.360
 and such as Shirovaka Yana,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.360
 in a part of the Buddha Yana thing,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.560
 samsara is full of difficulties,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.480
 tabals, lot of sufferings.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.800
 Is this true?

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 Samsara is the result of the cause of suffering.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.000
 Samsara is suffering truth.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.400
 Samsara is the cause of suffering truth.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.480
 That is our combination, samsara king.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.800
 They have a lot of tabals.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.080
 But according to the point of the various Mahayana,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.000
 whether it is the sutra of Mahayana,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.880
 or the Vedayana Mahayana, or causal Mahayana,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 the result of Mahayana,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.160
 if you have the skill and the techniques,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.640
 samsara is not bad of suffering.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.600
 Samsara is learning ground.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.300
 And samsara is an exercise,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.960
 stadium of the bodhicata,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.600
 so that we can stand and develop

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.960
 powerful tool of compassion and loving-kindness,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.520
 and then if we have that great compassion

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.040
 and loving-kindness of bodhicata,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.240
 then samsara is not samsara

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.280
 that always makes the difficulty of tabals.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.240
 Samsara becomes as pure as that.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.320
 For that reason,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.440
 great master Shanti Deva said, in the teaching said,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.600
 if you have the great bodhicata, bodhicata,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.840
 by the merituris of the marriage,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.760
 akumulahi merituri will make,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.560
 our physical will be strong,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.360
 and our wisdom merit will be very strong

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.720
 and comfortable of the mind.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720
 Therefore, physically comfortable and strong

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.200
 by the akumulahi merit,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.240
 wisdom merit will make,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.480
 our mind is strong and comfortable,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.440
 then even you are staying for a long time in the samsara

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.520
 to benefit from all others,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.720
 why that individual is a bored and tired by samsaras?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.440
 Samsara is the place where you learn, grow and develop.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.240
 Read the life story of the old great bodhisattvas

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.240
 and the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.240
 because they are going through the samsara,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.640
 learn and develop all the six paramatas, one after another.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.080
 Read the enlightenment.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.480
 Then they become known as warrior,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.000
 great warrior who defeated all the troubles and suffering,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.520
 the difficulties of samsara

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.040
 and one who become the leader to benefit for all living beings,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040
 all the great chariots

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.720
 that bring everyone to the enlightenment

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.040
 in beautiful blessed hands.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.920
 That is what the great teacher Buddha and all the bodhisattvas.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.520
 So therefore, that does not matter.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.400
 In either way, we have to change our buttons.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.880
 Whether we like to completely give up the samsara

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.400
 as sharvaka or the pati Buddha,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.480
 or we like to transform the samsara into as great nirvana

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.880
 or enlightenment status.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.280
 That we have to do.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.680
 If we can live just as it is,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.720
 it's not going to do any benefit to us according to the teaching.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.600
 So therefore, what in the teaching said,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.320
 the practicing lineage is open talk

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.120
 reflecting the poor renunciation of thoughts.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.120
 I listed yesterday, and of course,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.640
 you all know the poor renunciation of thoughts.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.040
 Our list again, first is precious human body,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.360
 reflecting on our own this very precious body or precious lives.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.280
 Second is a reflecting mind over the impermanence.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.960
 And the third is a reflecting of cause and effect that are inevitable.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.800
 That means the karma is inevitable.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.440
 And fourth is samsara has larger difficulties,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.880
 challenges, full of challenges or difficulties.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.040
 Those have to reflect.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.040
 What it does in the teaching said,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.880
 if you reflect those strongly and beautifully as it is,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.920
 it will make ours have more strong, more practical,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.080
 more common sense, less negative emotions,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.640
 such as ego cleanings, self-importance,

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:38.320
 more kind and gentle suffering to our own self and to the others.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.880
 Truly, we become a more gentle person,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.480
 gentle, individual, peaceful.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.600
 Then at the same time, we will value our precious times,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.040
 value our precious lives, everything we will like.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.800
 And we become more mindfulness, more thoughtful,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.200
 and more consciousness, more alertness.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:14.680
 All those beautiful truths will shine naturally from our mind or from our heart

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:22.760
 to guide and help us or guide and help others according to our capabilities.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.800
 So therefore, this four-renunciation thought,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.920
 or point that will change the mind.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.960
 What that means is change the mind.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.520
 Change the mind of the attitude of samsaras.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.040
 Change the mind of the attitude of these beautiful lives,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.680
 the precious body, precious lives.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.520
 Change the mind of the attitude of the notion of the parliament,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.480
 and change the notion of the kind of very sloppy, irregularity, careless person,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.080
 not thinking anything, and accept our own self,

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.680
 kind of right now, thinking of it, not thinking of the past,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.240
 not thinking of the future, and then kind of acting randomly,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.400
 kind of as a blend of thought activities.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:15.280
 Those all will change by reflecting of this poor training of mind

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.480
 or poor energy like thought, whatever we call it.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.080
 And this is also essence teachings of the, as I said yesterday,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.560
 teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamiri,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.160
 first two noble truths.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.200
 And suffering truth, cause of suffering truth.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.080
 We can understand clearly this.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.800
 First is, the precious lives.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.520
 In here, in his own dungeon which is said right.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.640
 Difficult to obtain what that means.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.960
 This, what we are actually, we are all human beings.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.360
 According to the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamiri,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.640
 is of course Buddha's teaching.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.880
 We more than think we think only kind of this human world,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.280
 is this most important, and that's it.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.160
 There's nothing more further than that.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.040
 Or maybe we think, or there's animals.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:20.440
 Animals and as human beings, we can only think that.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.600
 That is our knowledge.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.400
 Our knowledge is limited.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.120
 We don't see past.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.800
 We don't see the future.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.560
 We don't see even present times, except where we're looking,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.680
 or where we're focusing.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.320
 Everything is kind of blown, and kind of liquid,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.040
 in the presumption states.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.440
 In the Buddha's teaching, in the Buddhism, Buddha's teaching,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.920
 actually there is six realms.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.680
 These six realms is all are known as samsaras.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.800
 They're all within the samsara.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.120
 Samsara is a Sanskrit word which translates into Tibet,

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.400
 by each of those great translators in the eighth century.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:17.160
 Khurva means spinning, spinning or rotating.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.600
 That means also in Buddhism, the greatest teacher of the Buddha

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:29.480
 named to all the sentient beings are the gods, G-O-E-R,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.840
 I think, gods, or the movers.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.720
 We're always moving.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.000
 We're always on the go.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.960
 We're always going with the yu hos, stealing the yu hos,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.120
 dragging the yu hos behind and going all the time.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.720
 One after another, that's what we are always.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.240
 We never set up, actually.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.600
 It's going.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.040
 And that really is words.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.280
 Where we're going?

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.840
 And that word is, according to Buddha's teaching,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.200
 is spinning, spinning.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.760
 We go, we think we know where we're going,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.160
 but reality, we're just going, going.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.960
 We know only short distance, destination.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.440
 And then other than, we don't really know.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.120
 But still we're going, going and going.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.280
 Where are we going?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.520
 We are going in these six realms.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.400
 How are we going?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.960
 According to the greatest teacher of the Buddha's testimony,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.120
 we are going by the poles of our own deeds,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.520
 which is known as karma.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.560
 Karma is like fuel.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:55.360
 Fuel that is spinning us without any choice.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.000
 We are moving.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.280
 Who is creating the karma?

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.840
 Nobody overloaded karma from outside soma.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.760
 Karma is one's own creations.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.920
 And unknowingly we created karmas.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.160
 Unknowingly knowing the situation of the consequences,

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.600
 we created karmas.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.360
 We are moving.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.480
 With the yu-ho of the karmas,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.640
 maybe some has a bigger yu-ho,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.640
 some from a small yu-ho, but it is a yu-ho.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.240
 And it depends how the engine of our vehicle is stronger.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.040
 Sometimes even big yu-ho, we can drive quite easily.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.760
 Sometimes our engine and motor, those cylinders are not so strong,

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.240
 and then we are really dragging and dragging the cars and yu-ho on the highway,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.880
 and the police are coming and those controllers are coming.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.480
 I mean, you know, you all know, even through those things.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.520
 So that's the karma.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 That's just a small example of how many things are happening in our own universe,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.000
 in the perception universe, world of samsara.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.240
 So that's really how that happens.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.360
 So now we're moving, six veins, six hands.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.160
 So now in that way, now we are among the six veins,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.440
 we are in a human world, human world.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.320
 The human world, if you are born in a human world,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.600
 why we are a human world?

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.480
 It's called the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.600
 because we're born here with our karma.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.520
 Karma is not somebody pushed to us, or somebody dropped us,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.680
 or somebody bought us our own karma.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.920
 We're really born in a human world.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.640
 And of course, when we're born in a human world,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.200
 in the teaching, say, what that is karma, what karma karma that is.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.000
 The core in the teaching is good karma, good karma.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.160
 So that means we did something in the past,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.720
 we did something good karma, or to be born,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.360
 to cause to be born in a human world.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.520
 It's good karma.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.720
 So that means, since we're born in a human world,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.760
 naturally we have poor freedoms, naturally.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.760
 It comes with it automatically for freedoms.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.600
 Those are known as I'm not born in Helens,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.720
 because of my good karma.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.920
 I'm not born this time, for example, this time.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:51.360
 I'm not born in a humble gospel, because of my good karma.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.520
 And I'm not born in an ambulance,

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.880
 rims, because of my good karma.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.560
 I'm not born in a long life, God's reigns,

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.360
 because of my good karma.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:16.040
 And now, those three are known as three lower rims, lower rims.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.360
 And they are lower, lower than human rims.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.600
 And God's long life, God's reigns,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.120
 many times in the teaching, imagine, is in God's reigns.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.280
 But many great masters often say, it's not easy.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.080
 That is just kind of like interpretations,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.800
 but it is where those individuals who have that karma,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.880
 they can be anywhere.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.880
 Anywhere they can take the bird and become

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.280
 that status of the long life.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.560
 God, what is long life, God?

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.520
 In the teaching, he said, if you're born in that realm,

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:02.320
 but that's long life, God, they don't have too much senses.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.240
 Completely kind of absorbing, indeed, kind of sleeping status.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.720
 Everything is kind of like senseless, kind of like there.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.640
 And there is no alertness, no active clarity.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.440
 So it's just a kind of like stay in that long for long time.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.600
 It's wasted time.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.800
 There's nothing.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 So therefore, we should be grateful.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:32.320
 Happy of our past days, did that I'm not born in heaven.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.200
 I'm not born in the hungry God's hands.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.720
 I'm not born in animals.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.000
 I'm not born in the long life God's hands.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.600
 If we have no good karma, those are our destination.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.520
 These who are born in those three lower realms

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.160
 of long life, God's reigns, it's not

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.640
 that they designated to be born.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.160
 Because of the consequences of their garments,

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.600
 they took that.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.800
 In these lower realms, those places,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.200
 what troubles do they have?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.920
 Trouble of the Aries, the hell realm place,

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.640
 or the land of the hell realm is a disaster, as I said.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.800
 The political foundation of the hell realm

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.960
 is a disaster, ugly, and very, very impregnable.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.560
 And suffering is the experience what they're going.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:33.840
 It's a disaster and a suffering, and bad, enormous.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.720
 And the duration of that, according to the teaching,

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.680
 is like eons sometimes, really, so long.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.360
 They are in hell realms in the teaching.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.200
 Why?

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200
 They are so sensitive.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.640
 For example, more sensitive than our schemes.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.560
 But torment and what they're going through

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.080
 in their experience of the region is so strong.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.360
 Strong.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.440
 And the pyres and all of those things

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.080
 are seven or more times more powerful, more

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.360
 harder than our regular pyres.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.640
 And these are just-- and then hell grows in the same thing.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.160
 And we're in the same thing.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.160
 So therefore, our good karma, something

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.280
 we did past good that we can be proud, according to Buddhism,

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.000
 we can be proud.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.200
 I did something really good in past.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:36.800
 Now I'm a beautiful human being, as human beings.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.680
 Then above that, and in being a human being,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:46.440
 there's for, again, human that we can fulfill freedom or happy

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.040
 with them, we don't have those.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.960
 That, of course, you all know that in the teaching

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.600
 that you read, it's not something I'm talking about.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.440
 And what in the teaching said?

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.080
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.440
 And our attitude is not completely heretical.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.760
 Heretical or kind of wrong believers.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.120
 We have beliefs, which is freedom.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.800
 And we don't have any beliefs.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.880
 Even if born in human world, we will not improve anything.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.480
 Even though we have the very beautiful fortunate things,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.160
 we born in this human world, we don't have any belief.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.240
 We will not going to do more than anything.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.760
 But we're not just that.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.960
 We believe us.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.360
 We believe.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:40.480
 We believe in the past, in the prison, and in the future.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 That is a code in Buddhism.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.040
 That is one of the very, again, freedom.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.800
 We're not occupied by the non-freedom regimen at all.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.760
 We are kind of open-minded, freedom state.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:32:03.360
 And then we are not born as kind of like diabetics places.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.920
 Everything is just like they don't really

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.760
 have any kind of good sense of what

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.840
 is really happening to them or others.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.880
 They only believe what they think is the best.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.720
 Best and do that without any kind of, like,

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.960
 thought of any others.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.160
 We're not.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.440
 We're more thoughtful, more kind of think of them.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.560
 And then our old senses are good.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.520
 Even then, we're born as human beings.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.640
 Even we have belief.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.080
 Even we are not kind of like just only thinking

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.400
 of our own beliefs and all that thing.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.120
 But we have old-- we don't have our senses.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.120
 Then even we can't communicate.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.520
 We can't understand.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.320
 So we have really good senses.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 Every day, our senses are perfect.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.600
 How lucky, how fortunate we are.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.520
 We did good things in the past.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.920
 And the next one is, the last one is,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.240
 then according to teaching of Buddhism,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.840
 Buddha's teaching, sometimes there is error.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.760
 All this kind of time will come.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.560
 There's no Buddha came.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.920
 No teaching will go at all.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.440
 Sometimes that happens.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.760
 So in that time, our error, if we're born,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.720
 if they're even we're born as part of the beautiful human

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.960
 beings, even seven freedoms.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.080
 If we don't have that seven freedoms,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.480
 then we can't really understand the teaching

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.560
 or have communication or the teaching will be complete.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.040
 So there's still Buddha came in the world.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.520
 Still his teachings exist.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.960
 So therefore, all this way, we have to feel happy.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.080
 Roughly our life is so precious, beautiful.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.000
 Therefore, I should feel happy and have the determination

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.400
 and courage to use this for good purposes, something

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.040
 good, good purposes.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.400
 And then in the teaching, we're born as women born.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.600
 It's so difficult as examples that I'm not going to talk

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.360
 there now, maybe tomorrow I will talk.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.600
 But York, in the blend, total in the big oceans,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:22.240
 those three examples, the big ocean, big ocean, big ocean

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.040
 such as the Atlanta Ocean.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.400
 There is the blind total.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.760
 And this is just an example.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.480
 It's not something that realistic that we have measured.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.160
 And on the Atlanta Ocean or Pacific Ocean,

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.000
 there is floating to York, York.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.360
 That is the wind is kind of carrying from the east to west,

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.440
 west to north, north to south, kind of always

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.120
 is just carrying waves.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.320
 Or the wind is carrying them through the waves.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:00.960
 That blind total is coming out of the ocean surface

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.000
 in 100 years at one time.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.680
 One time.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.080
 And this York has whole, whole, right?

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.600
 York?

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.080
 York.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.800
 York.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.320
 York.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.920
 York.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.840
 York.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:21.680
 And Y-O-L-K or Y-O-R-K. Y-K-K-E. Oh, sorry.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:26.440
 Y-O-K-E. York has whole.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.320
 So now, this ocean is so big.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.040
 Just so big.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.800
 There is one York.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.000
 York is floating up in the dome and south in the east and north.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.560
 And there is blind total coming out of that ocean 100 years

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.800
 on the surface, kind of like pick up that.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:56.960
 And when coming up that total, coming up that ocean York,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:02.240
 in the side of the ocean, the whole of the York.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:09.680
 York is can be, the net of the total can be entered, entered.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.440
 That is quite kind of to comparing that how great

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.840
 is our rare human birth.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.640
 Is that is even more common than obtain the birth of human

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.120
 or higher ends.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.320
 You understand the example?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.360
 I help you understand.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.280
 I mean, you read this in the book.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.960
 This is just everywhere that.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.200
 What that actually means, what that means.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.920
 That tells that ocean is the metaphor of the three low realms.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.920
 How big that is.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.440
 Three low realms is so big.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.400
 Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, animal realm.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.560
 York is so small.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.440
 That is the metaphor of the higher realms or the human realms.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.120
 Human realms.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.360
 And it's moving back and forth that of York and everywhere.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.360
 That is common.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.360
 So entering that, how difficult that.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:18.560
 But even to obtain human birth is more difficult than entering

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.880
 the net of the total, the blind net of the total

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.040
 in the whole of the York.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.080
 That's what really teaching says.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080
 I mean, you read.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.840
 I just mentioned in my English and all that things.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.920
 But you read.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.880
 Thank you very much, everyone, again.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.840
 And I'm so grateful and happy to speak

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.880
 a little bit teaching of the Buddha and a reminder to each

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:48.000
 of us and this video opportunity of this situation for us.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.040
 So really, we delegated this merit at the end.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.000
 I mean, for every level, to every means, to all, to everyone.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.600
 Thank you very much, again.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.800
 And so now we do that again about 20 minute meditation,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.440
 about 20 minute silent meditation.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.600
 Again, always I said a really good motivation

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.480
 and devotion those all important.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.920
 In meditating and in practice, the realization

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.600
 is not just going to come.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.840
 It's a coordinated not by intellectual,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.000
 kind of skeptical and hesitant thought.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.800
 It only comes by the understanding of the devotion

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.920
 and connection and good motivation.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.200
 And we have that and realization really will come.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.120
 So those are the techniques that made the progress

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.480
 of our realization well developed by those motivations.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.920
 They will open the door and bring our inner realization.
