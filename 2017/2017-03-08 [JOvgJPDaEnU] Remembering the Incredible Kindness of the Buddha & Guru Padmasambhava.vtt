00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 Please feel the strong presence of the Guru Padmasambhava and the Buddha character Muni, insepar

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.760
able with the Kondasangva in the form of the Kondasangva and this is the teaching of the Buddha and

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.640
 the teaching of the Guru Padmasambha.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.100
 If there is no Buddha came in this world, if there is no Guru Padmasambha came to Tibet, maybe we

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 won't have this teaching what we are talking about.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 So, therefore, this is the teaching of the segregation teachers, linear masters, so therefore honor

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.840
 and respect and appreciation, sharing and gratitude is the noble qualities.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.140
 Because we like to follow the noble qualities. The noble quality also is something that connects

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.480
 with our own true nature, the noble quality is not foreign that we invite, we try to make alien.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 But we are in it by our misconception and misunderstanding of the ego-clinging.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.660
 By the teaching of the Buddha and the Guru Padmasambha, we try to come back where actually we

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.480
 belong, where we are.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.270
 That is what is called nobles. Noble is what is noble, love, compassion, devotion, joy, respect and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 appreciation, being graceful, being gratitude.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 Those are the nobles. There is nothing any more noble than that. You think carefully.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.490
 That is what the Buddha said and that you think too. It is not just a kind of believing,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 intellectually saying this and that, but that is the religion.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.100
 So, therefore, kind of activated that noble, bring out that goal like this, trying to be all our

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.680
 perceptions in the noble status.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.240
 Even we can't do immediately change everything in the perception of the noble, but at least we can

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.680
 change our perceptions. We can work with that.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.970
 That is our responsibilities, our duties. That is, if we do that, we are following our very life of

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.680
 this precious existence.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 And so, therefore, the strengthening of this, your meditation, your beautiful, with strong presence

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.680
 of the Kondasambha,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.820
 who is the embodiment of the Buddha Shakyamuni, the Gaurabhaya Masambha, all the linear masters,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 and then we join this prayer.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.540
 As teaching said, visualize that every sentient being has heard this song, this voice, so that they

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.680
 can connect with their own heart and own nature.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.680
 This teaching is not against foreign teaching. If you read this, it is teaching nagata.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 That is the point in teaching. Point out teaching to each of us.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 Observe that this teaching is not something there. Teaching is here. Really connect.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.330
 This is only reminding us to do this. This is by the kindness of the Buddha and the Gaurabhaya Mas

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.680
ambha, and all those linear masters.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:09.570
 So, therefore, again, we join this with those we were told, and just a reminder that, and now we

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 join.
