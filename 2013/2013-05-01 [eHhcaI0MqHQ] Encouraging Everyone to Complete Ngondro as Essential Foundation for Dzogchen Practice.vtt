NOTE     "synopsis": "On April 2, 2013 at Padma Samye Ling during the One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Mipham Rinpoche's Vajra Heart, Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche taught on the importance of understanding the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha, and sincerely applying them in our practice and connecting to them in our hearts. We must personally understand suffering and it's cause. Then we must practice the path truth of walking the path towards lasting happiness, and its path of accumulating the two merits through the practice of Ngondro. Here Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche strongly encourages everyone to complete Ngondro as the essential foundation for our Dzogchen practice.\n\n\"Refuge practice is the essence of the Buddha's first teachings on basic Buddhism. Bodhichitta is the essence of the Mahayana teachings. This is how we should begin all of our practices.\"\n\n\"For those of you who have completed Ngondro, how wonderful! It is one of the best fulfillments in the Vajrayana journey. We can remember that achievement even during our last breath. ... This Ngondro practice is the launch pad of all the Vajrayana practices. Without that, the practice won't settle, This was taught by all the great masters.\"",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 The Four Noble Truths of the Buddha are the first and foremost teachings of the Buddha. Among the

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.410
 four teachings of the Buddha, it is suffering truth and the cause of suffering truth. That is what

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.000
 the teacher teaches.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 What the Buddha said, positive Buddha said, suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, path truth,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:29.430
 cessation truth, and the second from Buddha, when he repeated that teaching, he said, must

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:38.000
 understanding the suffering truth, must be understanding the cause of suffering truth, must be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 understanding the path truth, and must be understanding the cessation truth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.490
 The cessation truth, that understanding what that means, understanding, is not just saying, oh,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.240
 that cause truth. We have to understand what is the suffering truth. Suffering truth, what is

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 suffering truth? Suffering truth is something that we know, we feel the way this comes from.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.830
 What is that means? Cause suffering truth, immediately Buddha pointed out the most sensitive things

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.380
 of the samsara that we have drilled, or something that we can bear, which is suffering. Buddha

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 immediately pointed that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.140
 But at the same time, behind that, everything is what in the samsara has cause. It's not just

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.520
 happened by itself. That must be understand. It must be understanding the suffering truth, must be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 understanding the happiness truth, truth, truth and happiness.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.500
 And both have to be understand. Both are not just coming by itself. So, it has cause. It has

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.000
 meanings.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.910
 That is the post-foreigner sessions. That reverses our mind, or portraying of the mind, management,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.000
 identity, training of the mind.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.060
 And then, suffering truth, or cause of suffering truth, is again, must be understanding what is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.520
 cause of suffering truth, must be understanding what is cause of suffering truth, what is cause of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.000
 happiness truth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.550
 What is that? In the samsara we have happiness. We have peace. We have joy. We have comfortable

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 life. But that has also cause. It's not just happened itself.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.490
 That knowledge is so important. That understanding is so important. That makes practitioners. That

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.000
 makes ourselves stronger, more open, more gentle, more peaceful.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.950
 That understanding is. That knowledge, knowledge. Then we put that into practice. Then it's known

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 as the true practitioners.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.600
 So, this four-novel post-tutis, four-renowned second thought, the essence meaning of the four-novel

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.120
, this four-renowned second thought is the essence of the post true truth, suffering truth and cause

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.000
 of suffering truth.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.300
 Once we understand, once we have the knowledge of the suffering truth and the cause of suffering

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.000
 truth, now we are going to make a difference to our lives, lives for others.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 That is known as the path truth. Path truth. That is all these other kundra practices, and I will

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.000
 practice this all what we practice, is the path truth.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.430
 Path truth. This foundation of the practices, as you all know, how we started path truth, how our

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.000
 journey begins, this excitement, joy, happiness, our journey, how it begins, that practices.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.800
 We are going to begin that practice with confidence, joy, and a closeness feeling to the Buddha, Dh

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.000
armasambhas. That is known as taking rafus.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.790
 Rafuti means, now you settled. You settled or we settled. We are not more wandering in the samsara,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.000
 looking, searching, engaging in things.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 We are now beginning to settle ourselves right on the places. Let grow ourselves.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.190
 We are going to settle with the beautiful assessment, with the support that is known as the Buddha,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.000
 Dharma, Sangha.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Something who knows, who went through this, who went through this.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 And who discovered that measures, who had similar experience as we do, who have been in samsara,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.000
 but change, big change, big change.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And that is what those who knows, who knows, and those who are experts, we are going to contract.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.060
 As we know the trouble, and we know the difficulty, we see that solution is something, we contract

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.000
 with the experts, that we do in the samsara too.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.100
 We contract with the doctors, we contract with whoever expert, as that trouble is shooting us, or

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.000
 shooting's trouble comes.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.600
 We contract with that. Similarly, this time, we are going to get the change of ourselves, and then

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.000
 that is taking leverage to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And with confidence, with devotion, with understanding of the samsara situation.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.070
 Samsara situation that is for us, bothering to us, and samsara situation that is bothering to all

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.000
 beings, combined with the great body together, that we are going to check the refuge.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.340
 And then there is many different ways to check refuge, outer refuge, inner refuge, single refuge, I

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.000
 am not going to talk all, but there is many different levels of the refuge.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.490
 But the essence of many of the refuge is deepening our practices, and devotion, confidence, and

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.000
 appreciation.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And we are settled now. We are settled. That is what the really refuge is, with that understanding.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And then, we are going to advance that practices.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.190
 That practices, now, then that is the second refuge, is known as bodhicata. Bodhicata is advanced

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.000
 practices.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.310
 Raphundi is more kind of like, in a way, more kind of like private, in one way, that way, kind of

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.000
 more focused, individually, or more kind of like that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 But now, that division is open, and thinking of all the beings, by our love and our compassion.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 That is known as, then, the bodhicata practices.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.090
 Raphundi practice is the essence of teaching of the Buddha's false teachings, all such as known as

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.000
 the basic Buddhism teachings.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Raphundi is the essence of the basic Buddhism teachings.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And bodhicata is the essence of the Mahayana teachings, teachings, teachings.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And now, we are actualizing and combining both, such beautiful ways, that within our art center.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 This is how to begin all these practices.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And that's why, therefore, again, we all resent the teachings of the Hindu.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.370
 We all practice at that. And I'd just like to also encourage, we should restate in our Mundo

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.000
 practice.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.540
 Those who completed, wonderful, one of the best performance in spiritual journeys, or in Varyana

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.000
 journeys, who complete the Mundo practice.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 It's wonderful. Really, it's wonderful. You can remember that. We can dedicate that.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 We can remember that achievement even our last breath times. We can remember that.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.850
 It's one of the great achievements. Those who are engaging that Mundo practice, I'd like to

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.000
 encourage.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 As other great, those masters, teachers, must be doing. I'd like to encourage to finish the Mundo.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 We should think. This Mundo practice is the launch pattern of the Jockey practices.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.440
 Launch patterns of the visualization practices. Completion practices, such of the, completion

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.000
 practice of the characteristics of such.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It is foundation practice. It's a light practice.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Without a doubt, it won't settle. It won't, it's still hovering in the sky.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 For that is, that is a witness by all these lineage masters.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 We need life story of all those great masters.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Everyone, look, read. You need life story of those great masters.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 How they were completely finished.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Mundo practice is not just a burden. It is practice.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 It is, it is our achievement, our fulfillment.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 It makes ourselves more gentle, peaceful, more relaxed, more fulfillment.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And more thankful, more graceful, a reliable breath.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Therefore, this is what we need to practice.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 So I like to encourage everyone, because this is teacher practices or the Jockey teachings.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 But Jockey practice is always best and make difference by the basic foundation practices.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 So therefore, again, it's so important, Mundo practices.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.610
 And then I will show that maybe more about Bodhicata and so forth in the next few days or these

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.000
 times.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 I would like to talk, let it be reminded that to all of us that we need to do this step.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 But with those understanding, again I go back to the teaching itself.
