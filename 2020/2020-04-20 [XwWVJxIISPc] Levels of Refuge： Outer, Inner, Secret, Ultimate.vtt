00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.720
 Good afternoon, good afternoon, and welcome. Welcome everyone. Thank you very much for coming

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.840
 and participating. Again, this is the again day we're doing a continual asset healing retreat,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.720
 or retreat, to reactivate our beautiful spiritual Dharma products in our heart.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.000
 We've heard so many, or we received so many teachings from great masters many times in the past,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.640
 and also we read many books. All those are so wonderful and so special. For now it's also time

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 to put that into practice, activate it, and that is also very, very important. And intellectually

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.000
 understanding it is very special and beautiful, but more than that, according to the teaching

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 practices. After when you receive the teaching, when you know intellectually, then you put that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.440
 into the practices. Practices, and that is really the settle in the heart and the discovery

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.520
 of our inner nature. Intellectual knowledge only will not bring big benefits. For example,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.880
 ever you know all the remedies of the goals, healing remedies, but if you don't apply those

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 as you know, what is not going to benefit too much for what we like to heal. If we like to heal,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.280
 post of course is very important to know all the remedies, all those tools and remedies and things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.400
 Once you know that, then the most important trick, I would like to get the result, tangible result,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.680
 you have to put that remedies into action, or you have to put activated that, and then apply that.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.160
 Then it will make a difference. Similarly, intellectually knowing dharma is of course

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.280
 always beautiful. Dharma is special, isn't that true. And small will get small, medium will get,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 oh small understanding will get small benefit, medium understanding will get a medium benefit,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 bigger understanding will get a bigger benefit in our lives. And smoothing our life and make more

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.190
 sense of the meaning for life is really able to dance. But however, if we put that into the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.680
 practice,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.280
 meditate, then it will really make a big difference. We can witness that by all those

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.880
 great masters, those learned scholars, their geners, their intellectually super duples,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 all those great masters, but that didn't stop there. They put practices, they did retreat,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:12.240
 stuck, and they truly then become the great symbol of the peace, beacon of the world,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:22.560
 of love, kindness, compassion, respect, appreciation, humble and simple,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.840
 simple. It truly beings, great beings they become, because they absorb teaching into the heart,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 that isolated their inner Buddha potentials, that wake up Buddha potentials. So therefore,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.120
 this time is kind of strange circumstances we had. Everyone has got these strange circumstances,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.440
 but we can use these strange circumstances to inner development, inner growth. And sometimes,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 also some really we can expand it and develop our body, for all those beings who are going through

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.120
 really challenges, big challenges, one after another. So really thinking of that. So therefore,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.400
 in those senses, we feel happy, in joy, more grateful, and thankful with our opportunity

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.560
 situation, for same time, activating our body, each other, in a heart, mind, as great teacher,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.140
 Buddha Shaktamuni, and all those great Bodhisattvasa mankind in the teaching, really kind of

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.280
 reaching

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.870
 what we're doing, benefit for all living beings. But to agree with that, then bring some

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.600
 understanding

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.480
 of the Vajrayana teaching of the three Vajrayana status. Vajrayana form, Vajrayana song,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:59.120
 and the Vajrayana space and mind. Those are realizations that what is our goal. So our goal,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.720
 not just a wait, kind of why, or later, we should start it now. It's important, all of those.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 So with this, again, we go over the teachings of the Jyabdhi, the new universe,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.920
 all his oldest of the new universe, and heart, advice to the fourth and the students. We are

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:29.200
 going again, continually, slowly, but we are kind of in some way exploring the root and the meaning

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.560
 of the of the teachings that not just going, going so fast and quickly kind of go over that,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.120
 we're going in a way, word by word, line by line, exploring that it is a flavor,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.240
 it is godless, it is a meaning, and when we say that it is meaning, looks like I'm talking of

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.600
 object,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.800
 but reality is our mind. We're exploring the beauty and the knowledge of our innate nature,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.290
 so we can glorify what will have to be really, and what what greatest teacher, Buddha, and all

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.440
 those

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:16.800
 great body, bodhisattvas did and are doing. So we're following in that team, that, that target.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.480
 So therefore, we're going slowly in a way. So now talking about, first with this,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:30.000
 very important is in a Buddhism or in a practicing lineage. Practicing lineage,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.200
 first a reflecting of the poor point of the mind, training of the mind on the other world for

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:47.040
 renunciation thoughts. I, and we went through that quite even thoroughly, in a way, reminding each

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.960
 others. And then after the once you have that kind of thought nicely and beautifully, and we'll

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:02.000
 recognize that or understand or reminded that clearly, and then we turn our mind to the three

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.560
 jewels, Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. And to turn the mind to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and in the

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.200
 teaching said trust, that is really important. But I'm going to talk though, maybe later, I will

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.440
 talk

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.520
 that, trust. But first, I'm going to talk about three jewels, later with three jewels. And we went

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:33.360
 through again, book about the Buddha, about the Dharma, and about the Sanghas. Today, generally,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:41.520
 the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha is a very general teaching of all the Buddhist schools. What that

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.240
 means, all Buddhist schools, talking about, from Dejan Buddhist schools. From Dejan Buddhist

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.560
 schools,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.360
 what that means, I'm talking about, such as Theravadas, in Southern Buddhist schools.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.120
 And Sarva Istvabada, schools of the Northern Buddhist schools, which is, for example,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.240
 the way the Buddhists, all those Mahayana countries, according to the modern grade master, all the

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:10.880
 Mahayana

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.040
 countries are based on the Sarva Istvabada schools of the foundation Buddhist schools.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:24.160
 These foundation schools are generally, after Buddha's Mahakharic, 100 years, aboard 100 years

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:31.680
 after Buddha's Mahakharic Nirvana, the foundation schools of Buddha teaching is expanded and become

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:40.160
 18 different sub-schools, expanded around 200, 300 years ago. There is 18 different

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:48.320
 sub-schools of the foundation schools, that including Theravada, and as well as Sarva Istvabada

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.280
 schools. And, but, however, now, while also a great master's modern time,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:03.440
 he says, now, only among that, 200 principles exist. Theravada schools of the Southern Buddhism,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:11.440
 and Sarva Istvabada schools of the Northern Buddhism that exist. These are the foundations

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:21.040
 of the Buddhists. These are the foundations of the Mahayana school, these are Super Mahayana school

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.040
,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:29.120
 and these are the foundations of the Vajrayana Buddhism schools. So, these three jewels

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:37.040
 is the foundation of all schools of Buddhists, whether you are the Theravada or Sarva Istvab,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:45.120
 or Super Mahayana or Vajrayana, this is the foundation. This is the cornerstone.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:53.360
 This is the foundation stone, or that is the corner pillars of the Buddhists. Not just only

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.320
 that, when you say cornerstone, or corner, corner, it supports all, that cornerstone,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.440
 we're going to support all the way top of the pinnacle of the building. Similarly,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:17.120
 refugee is the essential, what Buddha Dharma Sangha is essential of the building structures,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:25.040
 or the Buddhist forms. Now, so, this is no difference at all, but, however, in the Vajrayana

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:32.320
 school, there is also different terminologies, equal willingness of the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:45.790
 Many of you, or we all know, one of those, those are known as the Guru Deva Dakinis, Guru Deva Dak

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.160
inis.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:55.680
 And in the Tibetan, they translate it as Lama, Yedam, Khandro, those are really

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:05.280
 teaching. And Guru, I will use as the Sanskrit terminology, Guru. Guru is,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.160
 the word is always in the teaching, Guru is the root of blessings.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:27.440
 And these are the root, root of accomplishments. And Dakinis are the root of all

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.640
 fulfillment, or the activity of the benefits, beneficial activities. Those are, they're called,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.200
 also in this simple word, these three are, named in the Vajrayana teaching, three roots, three root

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.280
,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:49.440
 root of blessings, root of accomplishment, root of beneficial activities, benefit activities.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:58.080
 So how that is, actually, is like, as the equivalent of the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:16.320
 Guru as Buddha, Yedam as Dharma, or the deity as Dharma, Dakini as Sangha members, Sangha members.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:27.440
 And again, each of those, each of Guru, deity, and Yedam, they also represent all of those three

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:38.400
 truths. So that means, Guru is embodiment of the three roots. And Yedam is also embodiment of three

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:47.280
 roots. Dakini is also embodiment of three roots. They are not completely different from the East,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:56.080
 West, North, or South. It's all within that. And that, and if that, everybody know that,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.920
 everybody like to know that, everybody use that, each of those represented that. And Guru,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.640
 represented both of them. The realization of the Guru is Buddha.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:23.600
 The teaching of the Guru is Dharma. And the body, physical form of Guru is Sangha members.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:33.040
 And therefore, and also Guru is also within, Guru embodies all the three roots too.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:44.240
 And that way, Guru, body, physical form of the Guru, representing as, as Gurus.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:56.800
 And the tea activity of the Guru, representing as Dakinis. And realization of the Guru,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:09.760
 representing as deity or Yedams. So that goes on and on within Yedam or the deity and in Dakinis.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:17.440
 So this is the word, really known as the object, the rafu, of the Vaidyana teaching.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.800
 That also used, but it didn't mean they don't use the terminology of the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:32.800
 They use terminology and also they do practice in that same terminology, but yet they have addition

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:40.720
 of that rafu, which is equal will, it is not missing or something or any or subtract or anything

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.680
 like that.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.280
 So that is really simple way to tell inner or tantra to you, object or rafus.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:58.000
 Then inner tantra, so if I use the word outer object or rafu, inner object or rafu.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.270
 So outer object or rafu is the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. Inner object or rafu is Ah, Guru, Deva, Dak

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:07.520
ini.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:15.280
 And then, signal object or rafus, particularly inner tantras. Those are known as, then,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:27.600
 as channel, wind and essence element of the bodies. That also has three objects of rafus.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:41.280
 The reality level, these three are channel, wind, essence, Ah. The nature is enlightened states.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:50.400
 Therefore, in the Vedayana teaching said, our own physical body is divine mandalas.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:57.200
 Divine mandala. And not just only the body, the universe is divine mandalas,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.200
 reality levels. So to activate that realization, clearly not just any intellectual state,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.360
 to activate that, then there is plenty of teachings and instructions of the channelness.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:20.720
 And wind and the essence element of the bodies.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:33.600
 Nature of the essence element of body is Buddha. And nature of the essence of the wind is Dhamma.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:42.240
 And when the nature of the essence or the nature of the channels are Sangha members,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:51.120
 Sangha members. All the nature of the essence element is Guru.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.360
 The nature of the essence element of the wind is teaching.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:07.520
 All items, the nature of the essence or element of the channel is dakinis.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:19.040
 So it is within the completely the channels, wind and essence elements are the essential

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:27.200
 quality of this skillful means of the body of mandalas. This is what really actually in the

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.680
 teaching says. And how many channels are there? In the Buddha teaching together he said numbers,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:43.040
 there's even no numbers. How many channels in our body? There's no numbers, numbers. But however,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.920
 the principle channels, then use three that you can activate it in the teaching, highlight that

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:59.360
 it's three channels. And four or five jackals, or even sometimes seven jackals. It depends

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:07.760
 with the teachings. So those are the channels. Channels I need to build. It's translated as

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:17.680
 Sami. It is the root of the body. It is the foundation. Channels are the foundation of the

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:29.040
 voltage. So therefore it's called Sami. And three principle channels and five jackals.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:39.680
 And those are the ground jackals, and speech jackals, and heart jackals, and navel jackals.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.000
 And then we add more like that. Those are the very popular in the teachings.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.200
 Men should always say, but if you had a quality, there's also three extras. All armies depend with

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.960
 different dandruff teachings, but those are known as jackalas of the signal centers,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:06.880
 and jackalas of the pious, jackalas of the wind. Those are the many seven different jackals,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.480
 jackalas. And all those are the jackalas, and they are the passage of the wind.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:24.680
 Passage of the essence element of the, the essence element of the body. So those are known as jack

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:24.960
alas.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:34.960
 reality, really, these jackalas are, according to the teaching, it is, if we talk more higher level

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:43.920
 according to the teaching, jackalas are display of the nirmakas. They are enlightened as nirmakas.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:55.680
 They are essence. Nature is in the nirmakas sense. So now that jackala is filled with the wind and

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:03.600
 essence element of the bodies. And this is wind, this is earth, known as pipe principle wind,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:15.360
 and pipe soft principle wind. And those pipe soft principle winds are related with

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:23.520
 pipe senses organs related. And generally in the video and teaching or in Buddhism,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.640
 this movement of our intelligence and the movement of the channels or the movement of the essence

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:40.560
 element of learning is all carried by the wind. Wind, wind is the most powerful or one of the

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:52.880
 most powerful elements in our body or in the world. It controls the movement. It controls the

00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:07.120
 existence. It controls the expanding. It controls everything. Even in the teaching sense, mind is

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:18.560
 controlled by the wind. Wind. So wind is so strong, so powerful. And as well as our very life, wind

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.120
 is

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:28.400
 sustaining our bodies. It is keeping our body. It's spreading all the energies, all the vitality,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.960
 all the nutritious, all this evenly academic and a different area part of the bodies.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.920
 And therefore our conflictions and all those everything, all our other energy and all those

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:53.040
 are maintained beautifully. So this is known as the chakras or the passage of chakra and through

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.440
 that

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.880
 then is wind. I'm talking wind. So this is through the wind that is so powerful. Of course, I'm not

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.800
 going to talk those details of the wind, all that. And of course you can find, I'm sure you already

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.400
 know those things. So I'm just really reminded. So now what is this wind? Reality, this wind is

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:24.800
 in the inner thought level, it is no other than the sambukaya. Wind, this is sambukaya. All wind

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:35.120
 is the dharma. It is the movement. This is the activities. For example, greatest teacher Buddha

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:45.680
 Chakra Muni performed so many beneficial activities. But among that, the most powerful activity of

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.080
 the

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:54.400
 gracious teacher Buddha Chakra Muni is teaching dharma. That is the most powerful activity

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:02.000
 of the gracious teachers. Similarly, wind is the most powerful, powerful and that carries

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.600
 the quality of the, it is nature and beauty. And then of course, if we twisted the wind,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.600
 then it also lead all the numerous troubles and chaos texts, chaos texts in the samsara.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:27.600
 Those are known as the garment winds. And then it controls, wind controls our environments,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:37.270
 our perceptions, our constructions, our ideas, our feelings. That's how this wind is really so

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.680
 strong

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:48.960
 and so can relate, subtle, vital to our our own existence. So reality level, when you activate,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:59.120
 when you receive the teaching in practice, use that into that. That is then the teaching or this

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:09.600
 is then the sambukaya. You discover it, call it of the sambukaya natures. Natures. Then next one is

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:17.840
 optical graph which is in the, so now what I've taught. So chana, wind, and now at the next one,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:26.400
 I'm talking about essence element of the body. Essence element of body, how many there? To

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:34.720
 summarize that in the teaching is white and red essence elements. That is the essence element of

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:43.360
 the body. And that is actually what is the teaching, what it is. That is our essence of the

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.840
 physical

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:51.920
 forms. And indeed drawn this white and red element is not just only kind of like that we obtained

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.080
 from

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.760
 the parent, but it also connected with our own Buddha nature, our own potential of the nature of

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:08.880
 the mind. It is connected. That wind is reflected in the kind of like subtle form, the essence

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.360
 element

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:16.720
 of the body of the white and the red. It is recorded the teaching is principally located

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.280
 on the white essence element is on the current chakra. Red essence element is above the neural

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:32.000
 chakra or also not about the secret chakras, but throughout physical or throughout the physical

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:45.360
 mandala, it is spread out all over. As maybe I use the example, as mustard seed is pervasive oil

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:56.560
 everywhere. Same way this essence element is progressively spread out with everywhere

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:07.120
 channels and carried by the wind and evenly pervaded. But nature of this essence element

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:17.840
 a core inner tantra, then it is dharmakaya buddhas or it is buddha. It is really buddha.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:26.640
 Poem buddha came in the form of the essence element of the body. So knowing those

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:35.280
 resilient teachings, activating those qualities or even is merely kind of like opening the door

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:44.160
 up to understand discover of these physical major structures to kind of like activate it with a

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.960
 little motivation. A core energy is very important not blocking our kind of like knowledge and

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:58.480
 completely shut down, but opening the door is so important. When we discover that our own physical

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.440
 body is like the mandala of the deity, then we begin to discover that the whole this universe

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:13.920
 is a mandala or the pure land of the Buddha. Then it really we will see. So therefore this is also

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:23.040
 known as the with that understated and checked in reference channel as a dharmakaya, wind as a

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:34.400
 sambokaya and essence element of the body as dharmakayas. Those are known as that it is a

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.840
 cigarette object of reference cigarette object of reference. Then the ultimate effort taken of

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:52.160
 rafujis. Rafujis and then in zokki teaching is one's own nature of the mind. Nature of the one's

00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:00.560
 own nature of the mind, one's own awareness is the embodiment of three jewels. Buddha, dharma,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:09.120
 sangha, embodiment of the three roots. Guru, deva, dakini and then one's own nature of the mind or

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:16.720
 the ruka. The awareness is the nature of the three kaya, dharmakaya, sambokaya and then makayas.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:24.000
 And that is what really the nature of mind. This nature of the mind is not

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.480
 partialities. Some people have, some people don't have. No, everyone has equally. That means even

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:46.480
 animals, even their experience the most heavy is the karmic resources, still is shining in their

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:56.480
 heart as a jewel in deep storms or diamond in the deep stones. It's shining, glowing,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:06.480
 radiating that yet, heavy karna is the blood, heavy karna of that solid storm blocked of that.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:15.040
 But otherwise, every living being has that qualities. Therefore, every living being has the

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:22.080
 right to discover of this nature. Every living being has the right opportunity to discover.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:33.440
 But who is going to discover? Each of us is going to discover how with courage, with commitment,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:42.240
 with confidence, with joy, with loving body, with loving kindness and compassion, with relaxed,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:52.960
 calm, and humble, simple, droned earth. And then we begin to process, to go discover our beauty.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:30:01.600
 When we discover this beauty, how that will happen, how that will become, then re-livestored

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:08.080
 of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shatamunus, Gaurapayama Sambo, great master, Gungchimpas,

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:16.720
 all those great masters, that's what they really did, they discovered. How that will be when you

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.880
 see them, these individuals, how that will be externally, maybe they're just the same person,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:31.360
 as we are many up. But reality, their nature, their characteristics, calm, peaceful, humble,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:40.320
 simple, and more content, contentment, happy, happy with the literals, even though it looks like

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:40.480
 kind

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:48.080
 of like heart situation, circumstance, reality for them is like really pure nature. For them,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:56.720
 for those reasons, read the songs of those great monsters, read their songs. How beautiful, even in

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.560
 the heart environment, in a high altitude, like 17,000 feet above the sea levels, levels in the

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.880
 cold, and the snow, and ice, and all that, but yet they sing in song, how beautiful, how nice,

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.520
 and all the beautiful boy, they met all that, how much they're happy, they're like peaceful,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:27.200
 their heart is completely filled with love and kindness, compared to all living beings. That is

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.160
 how they discovered this innate nature, nature. So now again, talking about this essence nature

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.640
 of the mind, and one in the teaching city, the emptiness nature of the mind is dharma kaya.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:49.840
 The clarity nature of the mind or awareness is sambhokaya, and display a compact nature of the

00:31:49.840 --> 00:32:00.800
 mind is narmakayas. All emptiness nature of the mind is Buddha. The clarity aspect of the mind,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.600
 nature of mind, or I'm using nature of mind, but also can be rippa. In clarity aspect of rippa,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:18.080
 the awareness is dharma. In the comparison, display aspect of the nature of the mind

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:25.520
 is the sanga members. Therefore, nature of the mind is, as I said in the according teaching,

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:34.960
 is embodiment of the Buddha dharma sanga, embodiment of the guru deva dakinis, and nature

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:45.120
 of the mind is embodiment of the Buddha, sorry, dharma kaya, sambhokaya, and narmakaya Buddha.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:53.520
 And that is within our, within each of us. And where is that, according by the Anattika

00:32:53.520 --> 00:33:00.080
 and the Dokitika, it resides into the heart, heart center. It's right in our heart center.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:11.200
 We have this divine luminous unique quality that we have all. At this level, there's no difference

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:19.600
 between Buddha, the total enlightenment Buddha, and ourself. We have the same nature. So that is

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.280
 my brief talk today. And thank you very much everyone again for participating. And together,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.800
 again, we had the opportunity to talk a little bit about that. And so now I'm going to conclude

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:40.800
 with the talks on the Buddha dharma sanga from today. So then I'll move to the next topic,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.840
 which is a result of course with Bodhicitta. And then we go, oh, okay, thank you so much.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.120
 Even though maybe three of you and whoever are watching and everything, talking and reading,

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:57.920
 Buddha, dharma, sanga, and all that things. But so, okay, thank you. Thank you, everyone.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:10.800
