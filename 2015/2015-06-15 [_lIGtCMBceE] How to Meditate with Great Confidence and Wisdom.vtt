00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
 Kala Khyakritanter also said, "This is not dull emptiness," Kala Khyakritanter said.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.080
 And so it is not blank, blank emptiness. It's sub-luministic clarity, completely united

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 target with that nature, and it is the absolute natural as it is. It is, and from that level,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.280
 and in the nuxin level, and all this nuxin is, beyond of the existing, non-existing,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.760
 beyond of the empty, not empty, is beyond of every, every duality consumption. It is only

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.360
 well experienced by our own intelligence, awareness, and therefore this name is known

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.200
 as then great emptiness, clarity, self-awareness, and awareness, emptiness, all the union of

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.930
 emptiness and appearance, and so many terminologies used to refer to this own natural. And

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.200
 therefore

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.400
 that reason, again, is in the teaching, it is also known as the union of the body and that

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.760
 teaching, as I taught, and here more as I taught quotations from the, from the Tantra and the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 ordinary nature of the mind, is like sky, it's done that free from every conceptions, and this,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 to discover this inner nature, many yoginis, yoginis use different methods, the method of the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.600
 skill women, method of the wisdoms, for the instruction, they will discover, is not something

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 that they will discover by the intellectual ways, is beyond of the intellectual ones, and this is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.160
 that discover the unborn true nature. And so it's not the, it's not the negation

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.440
 status of the emptiness, it's not the subtle state of the mind, it is beyond of everything. This,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.760
 through that, and so therefore, we should not necessarily take that anyways, this only will,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.560
 therefore, to discover this in a natural, exactly as it is, you have to take the oral instructions,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.200
 oral transmissions, oral class, oral, yeah, instructions, other instructions from those

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.520
 with their alarmas, who went to the highest state realization, realization of by the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.680
 Dzogin, and all Mahabhadras, you have to listen from that. So therefore, this is what the nature is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.680
,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.640
 is, and that is the, nature is beyond of the every conceptions. And now, to do these practices,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.160
 again,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.000
 I will talk a little bit about, again, these meditations, as we've been talking about. And now,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.240
 as you said, when you first, of course, this, this is the directly pointing out teachings,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.200
 teachings,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.240
 teachings, immediately we're going to target, and then there we rest, relax. Once we discover that,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.760
 then that's fine. That means, when you discover the practice, or when you practice,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 we have to have confidence. Confidence is very important, that for that reason,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 in Gharap Doge's three words, what, first introducing inner nature, nature, and the second

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.560
 tati tobji in it a bit. That means, you're just re-establishing your confidence, as you discover

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.640
 the nature, nature. That means, there's nothing to go out, no matter whatever is happening,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.120
 happening.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.360
 In the teachings said, said, this nature is cannot be changed by the subject,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.800
 is cannot be changed by the object, no matter whatever is happening, whatever

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:06.320
 happening around you, it is, it's within that. It's nothing went out. Once you see that,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.200
 once you have know that, then we're not going to bother anything. We're going to relax

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 on our cruise lines, exactly on that line, line, cruise, we're not going to evaporate with it.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.200
 If we start evaporating, that means our will is shaken. Once we have got the will,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.760
 we have to maintain. Maintaining. Maintaining is, I said many times, is meditation. Maintaining is

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.880
 meditation. Dzokhi level, there's nothing constructively effort meditation. You have to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:55.680
 maintain that. Without shaking by any subtle tense turbulence, the arising drew to the our grasping

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.680
,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.880
 drew to the our habiji pattern. Even that happening is not going out, not changing the course,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.880
 not changing the nature. We have to be confident on our will. That's called

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.680
 paichin todo ji. We have to have that confidence. We have to see everything, that's it, whatever

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.040
 that is, there's nothing. In order to find out that, as I said, direct that introduction,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 and as a great master that we need to receive the involvement, for the involvement,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.320
 or receive the instruction, you discover, you get the confidence, and relax that. Now we're not

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.440
 going to learn that. That is one way. Another way to do that, even Dzokhi teaching, or those

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.160
 practice lineage teachings, are very immediately approaching that. But however, then through the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.920
 analyzations that we went yesterday, through the analyzation, it's not analyzation as we do in

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:06.080
 Mademaka teachings, as we do in those teachings of the Sutra teachings. We went to the target,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.240
 to the heart, from there we just established every voice. And there, again, in that, and then, as

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.400
 he

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.560
 said yesterday, this is not just the pharmacy, this is the voice and instructions of the great

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:29.920
 those masters. And the examining of the mind's source, destination, and prison, suni and process,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:38.880
 you examine that. Because why you do this? Because make sure our will is not going to linger.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.240
 Our meditation is not going to linger. Everything is now mind, and mind is empty.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.120
 That is, that is what really established. Mind is empty, or mind is three-guide status.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:04.960
 Mind is three-guide. To make that confidence, realization, nagat realization. To make that,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:14.400
 so we went to the suni dosa. Song means where is coming, nay means, or dron means where is going,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.360
 and where it is. Where is now? And that means past, future, and present.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.800
 Present. If we look anywhere, mind is not at three-guide levels. Then we look out,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.280
 mind is outside, inside, to make sure that we're not going to linger in our meditation practice.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.920
 It's outside, it's inside, we check. Again, we didn't find. Inside, again, maybe I didn't say

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.000
 yesterday, but inside check with physically, with emotionally check. Where is mind? In the

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.280
 physical level, where is mind? Physical level. Emotional level, where is mind? Each level.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.880
 We didn't find anything. We, every time we pull out the source of grasping, root of grasping,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.840
 there is no mind. There is no mind. There is no mind. There is no mind. Now, where is this

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:14.240
 no mind? No mind. No. Where is mind? Then, we uprooted everywhere. Now, we single out,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:23.920
 single out the mind. Where is mind? Mind is no mind. We didn't find anywhere, any place,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.960
 any logic. We never find, and did never find. All the Buddha's movies of the enlightened means,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:39.840
 never found, solid exists the mind at all. And the modern scientists, I don't define at all,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:50.400
 anyone purposes. That then, now we're completely reconcluded. Every chapter, every kind of like

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.200
 might thinking mind is uprooted. There's no mind, and mind is now to look to the mind itself.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.720
 Where is this? What is mind? And to look at this mind, then the great master's minister says,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:12.800
 still we think, then every day's mind have to have some forms. So what forms? There's two forms,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:21.200
 form of color, form of forms. Color forms. What is white, yellow, red, blue, star? All the color,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.840
 we think none of those mind, none of those, none of those, none of those. One after another, they

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.840
're

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:36.400
 known. And forming a level is rectangle, square, semicircle, all those forms, forms, none of those

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:47.120
 minds. That uprooted everything now. Now, where is the mind? Mind. So there is no mind. But yet,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.640
 there is this mind, this intelligence. That's what the great master said, is nature is empty,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.120
 nature is clarity, nature is pervasive. All comparison. In the Zogji teaching,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:15.520
 that is what it is. It is empty, it is clarity, it is energetic. Yet, it is totally beyond

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.320
 everything.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:24.080
 That's how the mystery of our self-born awareness, how that beauty is. This is beyond the death,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.480
 beyond the birth, beyond the getting old, beyond the sicknesses. It's beyond any reference point,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.840
 any regulators. It's totally that naturalistic. That is the mind. Now, once we discover that,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.920
 once we find out, now we are not going to linger in shaking and trembling of our

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:51.600
 meditation. That means no doubt, no hesitations. No doubt, no hesitations. We are going to stay,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.560
 fearless as the mountain. That's what in the Zogji teaching, what's the name?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:06.000
 Montre Lang Vue. That is what it is. Vue is strong, not going to shake. Because it is that true,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.480
 we are staying on that truth. True. There is no longer of doubt, hesitation, might be this,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.000
 might be that, might. Because we search everywhere, we look everywhere, we have mascara everywhere,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.440
 and all the bodies of our dead, didn't find it. We can conquer the same as they did,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:33.840
 these great beings. Same thing, our small mind came the same way. So now, we have to relax,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.920
 we have to relax. When we are relaxing, that is the meditation. When we are relaxing,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:46.800
 this is necessary in the mind, then, particularly in the beginning of the time, our meditation,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:57.360
 then we will have three major experiences, periods that we go through. I mentioned that before too,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.840
 I mean those different things, but this time is called Nepa, in the Tibetan word, Nepa,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:12.400
 Jova and Rupa. These three things will come. You have to be aware of these three things.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:22.720
 This is aware. Nepa means abiding. Now you are resting, you are resting on that Vue. Vue.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:34.240
 That is Nepa. When you are resting in that Nepa, there is Jova. Jova is movement.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:46.080
 That means, when Jova comes, what do you have to do? You have to behold that. You have to

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:54.880
 aware that. Rupa. Nepa, Jova, Rupa. This is the western world of those practice, masters of

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.360
 practice

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:04.880
 lineages. This is not just a valuable. It is a practical instrument. It is instructions, practical

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:13.840
 instructions. We should take that very often. Nepa means abiding. Now, when we are resting in

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.360
 mind, generally, there is two techniques that we all heard. I am not just you. I heard the two.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.480
 We all heard that. These are two techniques. Rinaldha in the Buddha teaching is known as

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:36.960
 Samatha and Vibhachanas. Samatha and Vibhachanas. Dzogchi teaching is what? Dzogchi practice is

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.680
 Vibhachana practice. It is a Vibhachana practice. Also, it is practice of the Dzogchi practice.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.840
 Many great masters say, in the same way, Kedipad is here, when you are meditating on

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:56.720
 the Dzogchi states, Vibhachana and Samatha are united. Not just separated. What that means?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.400
 Kedipad said that too. He said, the aspect of, the abiding aspect of the mind is Samatha,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:12.480
 and seeing the nature of that mind, that aspect is Vibhachana is Toged. Therefore, it is

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:20.480
 Samatha in the union, Samatha in Vibhachana, Toged. Toged. Toged. So, this is what. So, when you

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.960
 relax

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:28.720
 with that nature's mind, now when you relax with that nature's mind, mind's post is abiding. That

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.480
 we do immediately. Now we meditate. That's what we say. We meditate. We meditate now. With good

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.360
 postures,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:44.320
 with good things, we rest. The moment we meditate, most of us, Shiva comes.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:54.080
 Thought comes. Thought comes. That movement comes. What is the movement comes? All different

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:01.200
 habit patterns. That of the past memories. That's something connected to us. Something that

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:16.880
 is connected to us. There's something to do with our house, our kitchen, our garage, our garage,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:29.360
 our kitchen, our neighbor, our friends, our outing. What's called a dining? Dining. Dining. Out

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.440
 dining? Those

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:41.280
 pretty, pretty wettest young boy and young girls. And whatever. Something should come up. A moment

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:51.120
 we sit. It looks like all comes up. Comes up. That happened many times. And we, wondering that,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:59.280
 follow with those, trying to think what is named that in the teaching. Distracted. That is

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:08.320
 destruction. This is not destruction. Out of, it is inner destruction. Now destruction comes.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:22.080
 When we wander with that, then we lost our will. We are wandering the outskirts of the display

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:29.440
 of the rupa, or in other words, duality. We are wandering. We are wandering. We are maintaining

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:38.720
 that. We destruct it. Moment that happening, what we have to do? That is called rupa. We have to,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:48.160
 aware that. We have to see that. Immediately aware that. Don't let, don't let to go power.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:59.520
 Power. That is then rupa. And now, when this yuwa comes, the nearby is abiding.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.160
 Yuwa is a movement. When yuwa comes, what the terminology in the teaching used, or Buddha used?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:17.600
 It is seungwa and gopa. Seungwa and gopa. Seungwa means drowsy. Seungwa is two arrows,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:29.520
 two magical arrows, mistakes during our meditations. Seungwa is sinking mines. Drowness,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:38.720
 drowsy, sleepy. Kind of all those are not clarity, not brilliant. Not those are all known as

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.920
 drowsy. Moment we start sitting, our mind becomes kind of dull and we fall asleep. Almost sleeping.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:54.800
 Sleepy. That is, again, one of the arrows. Arrows. Second arrow is, I already said,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:08.320
 this gopa. Gopa is scattered mind. Wild. Wild minds and distracts. Very ruffly, distract. There is

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:18.000
 dripping of the distractions. Very disturbed and then medium and very subtle. Sutter distractions.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.800
 Those big ones then related with emotions. Not just a garage, not just a restaurant,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.120
 not just only our dining room things, but something related with emotion.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:37.920
 Completely our mind is carried with anger or with anxiety, worry, something kind of bursting in our

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.440
 head. Completely burst at that. When that happened, we have to be storm ourselves,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:52.720
 resettle, settle ourselves, and walk with strong devotions. Again, any of those things comes in

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.880
 the teachings. Devotions. Feel the strong presence of the gopa. In Bodhi Madhu, all the kirirate

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.520
 teachers

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:06.800
 must see that. All the bada shabtam, dara. Feel their blessing, vowels. Rest strengthening.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:13.280
 Why am I wasting my time? I have enough time to think of these things. Other time, I'm not going

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:19.760
 to think that now. I'm going to give, break, package into my own peace of mind, this mind,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.760
 and let that kind of with courage, with commitment, with strength, I'm going to rest. Rest that.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.720
 And then second thought is something related with personal things. And then subtle things,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.840
 many of those things, and sometimes, ridiculous things, unnecessary things comes out in the mind.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:47.280
 But any of those, whatever it is, it's destructive. It's destructive from our meditation,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:54.800
 from our dzokti meditation, from our samad meditation. Therefore, we should rest strengthening

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.240
 our courage, commitment, confidence, joy in the applications, and then,

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:09.440
 meditate. Practice. Meditate. Feel strongly. And think of the pull, pull those legs. If it's too

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.400
 much destructive, thinking of these. Like poor, poor inner second thought, impermanent, life is

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.520
 precious,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:24.240
 impermanent, cause and effort is inevitable. Or impermanent, thinking of the impermanent,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.000
 how much things are changing, how many things are wrong, why I worry, why I think I have to settle,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.400
 settle, and I have to stop myself, joy. And with this stone, again, as it's devoted,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.120
 or body, or love and kindness compared to boundless love, boundless joy, boundless appreciation,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.680
 boundless economy, all those we would bring up those shorter and denser with meditate.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:21:02.320
 So this is what this neva, juba, and rupa, that is. And then, in order to do this, if still there's

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:09.600
 a lot of concentrating, a little bit difficult, then use, as Buddha taught, techniques of the

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:18.080
 concentrating right in front of your, in front of you, maybe just in front of you, the convenience

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:27.440
 area, hold some objects on your mental states, or put some small objects, objects, and concentrate

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:39.440
 to that. Concentrate strongly, your mind joined with I, I joined to that one piece of object.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:47.840
 In a way, triangle level, strongly concentrating to that, and stay that, trying to stay that state

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:56.560
 as a pope, or one minute, one minute, trying to stay there, strongly, strongly with that,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.120
 concentrate

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:05.200
 that. And if that strong state is quite good, then you can release that, then relax, just rest,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.640
 rest. Again, you can maybe concentrate strongly, hold something in the mental state, and stay,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 stay. And then that has become quite good, and then release, and then the rupa status, free from

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:25.920
 every reference point. Relax, bring more clarity, that's what it teaches you. Relax, relax means,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:33.200
 relax the body, relax the wind or the breathing, that means keep normal breathing, and relax mind,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.640
 mind reduces every conjugate level, and now settle in one person's status, person's state,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.840
 and one moment of the person's status, one moment of the person's state, and then relax,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:54.240
 and relax, and don't hold anything. And it's okay to say, don't think, don't hold, and relax.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:03.040
 Relax means everything is relaxed, that means nothing particularly relaxed about that, but

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.600
 everything becomes natural, exactly natural, where the nature is, the body becomes natural to all

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.760
 the

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:16.960
 systems, and when the movements become natural, exactly way, and mind totally stays in the person's

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.520
 state of the moment, present status, relax. When it's relaxed like that, and then trying to

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.240
 stabilize

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:32.720
 that, stay there with the awareness. Awareness is, you keep, awareness of mindfulness as distantly,

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.160
 in the teaching, what's it, Kirma used also to chant that praise, praise, distantly have the

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:49.200
 mindfulness watching your mind, not closely watching, mindfulness always constantly kind of

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:57.120
 mindful, using the mindfulness, but distantly watching your mind, your meditation by the

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:04.400
 mindfulness. The great teachers use examples, when you put, when you do, when you go up with the

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:13.360
 animals, animals, use that same technique, when you go up with the animals, and when you put those

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.120
 in beautiful grassland, or wherever comfortable grasslands, then you pull back, you're not going

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.840
 to have to stay behind, right behind the animals, pull back, and relax yourself, and just the

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:33.200
 distance is watching the animals, same way, distantly watching the your meditation, or the

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:40.400
 Dzokki meditation, not necessarily staying all the time, but always, you're really not left

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:50.160
 distracted by any means, relax, pray, and always in the teaching said, relax, we relax with clarity

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.160
,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:58.160
 relax with clarity, that I told you other day, in the Dzokki Toga, so not Toga, Tukkyu practices,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:04.240
 Tukkyu practice, particularly special and stockings of the Tukkyu meditation is what,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:14.960
 immovable body, immovable of the senses, that means not expanding, not inward,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:26.480
 drawn in, keep open, exactly senses the way they are, so immovable senses, immovable of the

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:37.280
 mind, relax, and when you do the immovable way in the teaching, bring a little clarity, clarity,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.040
 kind of fresh energy, freshness, that means the ventilation is so open, that breathing

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:54.560
 pressures are moving, you're allowing that, waking up the energy, power of the five muscles,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:02.800
 five muscles, intelligence allowing, not block it, not block it, not cry, open that opportunity,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:11.920
 and relax that, those are the teachings, so therefore, therefore, when we meditate again,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:21.360
 with that way, trying to keep them, meditate with good qualities, qualities, maybe content is good,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.880
 call it, really trying to do that, so now again, when we're wrestling our mind, it's abiding,

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.640
 and then Joa, Joa is movement, thought will come, it's natural, and there is a way thought comes,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:44.000
 I said the other day, the great was, there is five different ways, the thought will

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.120
 wrap me whole, and then gradually settle there, that all comes, but don't let destruct,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:27:00.560
 this is our responsibility, don't let happen, even we can keep our mind for 10 seconds,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:08.960
 15 seconds, that's good, don't let go, and be aware of that, and when that happens, if the

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.360
 teachings

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:16.480
 say, don't worry, feel bad, don't feel bad, don't kind of blame, or why this and that, all those

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.000
 things, that's just a part of nature, part of the nature that we are going through, it's nothing,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.080
 therefore, we're not detecting that, we're aware of that, that means we are practicing,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:34.000
 that means we're practicing, it's good, it's nothing wrong, don't blame, don't feel bad,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.160
 don't be disappointed, but we strengthen the joy and appreciation and good things, keep opening,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:47.360
 that's it, and keep the mind from all those beautiful things, and relax, that is what the

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:57.280
 Dzokin practices in the teachings, and then we can advance and gradually come very beautiful,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.320
 and many minds will settle, and that is a practitioner, and that is my brief teaching

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.160
 for today. Thank you.
