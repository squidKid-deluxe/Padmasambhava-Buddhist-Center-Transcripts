00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 This is our "Primordial Wisdom". We are talking "Primordial Wisdom".

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.240
 In the general Buddhist of teaching in the Mahayana Sutra, the teachings are known as "Definite

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
 Meaning" as we discussed yesterday.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.380
 Definite Meaning teaching, what is known as that? What Buddha, the greatest teacher, Buddha Chakra

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.360
 Munnaen for that.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.240
 Known as "Athaka Dangarbha", Buddha Nature. That is Definite Meaning.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.970
 "Athaka Dangarbha", "Primordial Wisdom", why you call Definite Meaning? It is never going to change

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.240
. Never going to change anything.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.670
 And for that reason, what is it? In teaching, no matter what things happened in the universe and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.240
 beyond, what really happened, the nature is never going to change.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.450
 And for that reason, the great Master Kumbha said, "Even we go through the six realms, even we take

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.240
 the birds through the four channels of the birds, birds."

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:11.230
 But "Primordial Wisdom" remains the same. Nothing happens. That is the "Primordial Muslim" or the "

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.240
Buddha Nature".

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 How is that "Buddha Nature" or how is that "Primordial Muslim"? Whatever terminology we use.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 But in the Dzogki teaching, use the old and inherited "Primordial Wisdom".

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 So "Primordial Wisdom" is what? It's pure from the beginning. It's pure from the beginning.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:46.730
 And that was teaching said, for example, Samadhi Rata Sutras, even in Mahayana Sutras, "Primordial

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.240
 Wisdom" or the "Buddha Nature" is pure, clear, undisturbed, cannot be disturbed.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 In the end, it's uncompounded. It's not compounded. It's uncompounded.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 That is the quality of the "Primordial Wisdom". It's pure, clean, pristine and brilliant.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.620
 That is "Primordial Wisdom". That "Primordial Wisdom", we are not talking "Primordial Wisdom" of

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.240
 the Buddha or "Primordial Wisdom" of the Buddha, Samadhi Rata Sutras.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 Great Buddha Chaitanya Muni is pointing out of each of us. Our "Nature of Mind" is that.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 Your "Nature of Mind" or the "Primordial Wisdom", that is what the explanation is.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 And my "Primordial Wisdom", that is what the explanation of this teaching is. That is what it is.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.850
 That is uncompounded. How that "Nature" is, in the Dzogchen said, it is naturally liberated, pure,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.240
 different ways.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.900
 Naturally liberated, if I use that "Liberated" terminology, "Nature" is pure, pure, pure, pure,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.240
 different ways.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 And for those poor, poor viewers or poor "Liberated", these ordinary "Liberated" and sub-liberated

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:23.240
 and instantly liberated and free from the extreme or liberated from any boundaries, boundaries.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.240
 All these "Liberated" are used in another terminology. Just maybe easy understanding.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:41.370
 Pure, ordinary pure, sub-purity and instantly pure and never bounded. Anything is completely,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.240
 always pure in every direction.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:53.810
 If that is the direction, any direction, that is how this "Primordial" your wisdom and my wisdom is

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.240
.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:03.240
 This is what it is. What is it? So that is how it is in the teaching said.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:12.540
 That "Primordial" wisdom, the original wisdom is never deluded by any means of the samsara

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.240
 situations.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.240
 That "Primordial" wisdom is never deluded by any means of the samsara situations.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:31.560
 And therefore nothing's "Primordial" is affected. Never, for that reason, is known as "Organally

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.240
 liberated".

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 All liberated from the beginning, from the very beginning, is liberated.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 And then these are sub-liberatives. And then these two, again, when we are liberated,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.110
 it's not something liberated by some other antidote that is making liberation or some other object

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.240
 that is making help.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:12.240
 It is sub-liberated. Sub-liberated. What even that is also, it is naturally is there, naturally

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240
 liberated.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.420
 But at the same time, this prison time, what even thoughts, what even arises is incidentally sub-

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.240
liberated.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:34.240
 What even arises thoughts through our six senses, conceptions, poems, hearing, smell, taste, touch.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.240
 What even that is instantly liberated by itself.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 Every don't grasping, every don't clinging onto that. It's naturally liberated.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 As I think we said three times yesterday, it's come from the Dharmakaya.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 It's displayed in the Dharmakaya for the great emptiness. It merges back to that emptiness.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 It's just instantly all that happened by itself. We don't have to do anything extra effort or bring

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 some other tools trying to liberate it.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 For that reason, and as in using the Dokki teachings, as snack untied by snack themselves.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.240
 Self is not something that we have to do. It's just instant.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:42.660
 And then third one, this Raghwai is instantly liberated or that negative liberations, negative

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.240
 liberations.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:53.220
 The moment we see as a subject object, when we see something as object, that moment, if you look to

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.240
 your awareness, that instantly is liberated.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:06.240
 You look to that lookers, for example. When you look into the object, means you look to the lookers

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.240
.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.240
 That moment already is liberated. That instant. So it's a negative imperative.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.240
 It's instantly, there is no subject or object to be awakened.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:29.400
 It's instantly that creed, that conceptual is a creed. Pre-liberated. And that is known as negative

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.240
 liberation.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:45.240
 Then, this Raghwai is free from or liberated from any means of the, any space and times.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:54.240
 Raghwai is not based on time. It's not abiding in the past or it's not abiding in the present.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.240
 It's not abiding in the boundary of the future. It's out three times.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:09.890
 And also Raghwai is out three from all the spaces or pretty any areas. There's no boundaries at all

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.240
.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:20.690
 Raghwai is totally free. Therefore, it is known as free from every corners or every edge or every

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.240
 extremes.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:32.240
 It's totally free. That is the call and nature of the Raghwai. That is the nature of the Raghwai.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.240
 Again, Raghwai is we are talking about our own nature of the Raghwai.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:45.240
 Our own nature. That is about how it is. How it is.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:55.520
 And this is now, when you understand that, then with great confidence, how are we going to activate

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.240
 that?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.240
 How are we going to activate that? This.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:09.240
 And that activates. Now, that original Raghwai, the original basic primordial wisdom,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:16.240
 is another terminology in the Dzokhi teaching known as ordinal summoner-buddhas.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.240
 That is the Buddha summoner-buddhas. Absolute ordinal Buddha summoner-buddhas.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.240
 Buddha summoner-buddhas is again another terminology we use again as opposed to here.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:36.240
 Also use summoner-buddhas. Otherwise, dharmakaya. That is absolute dharmakaya.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.240
 In the Dzokhi teaching, summoner-buddhas is dharmakaya.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.240
 Dharmakaya Buddha. Dharmakaya has, summoner-buddhas has great food to stop doing it.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.240
 But this time, it is ordinal basic Buddha summoner-buddhas.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.240
 And that basic Buddha summoner-buddhas or ordinal dharmakaya is primordial wisdom.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.240
 That is what we said. So many times throughout the teaching, see.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 That primordial wisdom of our Raghwai is, nature is how? It is unimpeded.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.240
 Unimpeded. That is again, it is to your own, our mind.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.240
 And it is ordinal nature. When you behold that,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:31.240
 or when you are understanding that, intellectually, as it is to your own, natural mind,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.240
 when you see that, that is known as, now you got it. You got it.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.240
 That is called, you got it. That is true. Then you got it.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 Who got it? You got it. Come by yourself.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.240
 That is known as, pointing out on the Dzokhi teaching, three words of the karabdron.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:59.240
 Karabdron, he said, then you got it. That is it. There is nothing more go.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.240
 More order to go than that. If you are trying to go further more,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:10.240
 then we are falling back to the ditch of the samsara in the duality wars.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:17.240
 Simply relax on that. That is known as, more rattle through in it a bit.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.240
 You discover it by yourself through the assessment of the teachings.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:30.240
 When you recognize that, when you got it there,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.240
 that is not depicted by the object, that is not depicted by the subject.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.240
 That has nothing to do with the exact, except in the reactions.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.240
 It is ordinal nature, exactly as simple as it is.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.240
 It is, that is what it is. And this is called ordinal bastance.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.240
 That is what you call, then may have the confidence.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:07.240
 Confidence on this. You don't have to linger in some, that this might be this might.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.240
 All this is, is delaying, delaying our discovery.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.240
 All is withholding, then in the ditch. Those are known as detours.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.240
 Have you tried to figure this, figure that, all that? It is deterring.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.240
 Even we think we are doing better, but we are really deterring, conceptions.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:39.240
 Therefore, is what the second garabdoli war is, have the decisive, decisive decisions with full of,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.240
 of confidence.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:50.240
 Enjoy when you discover, be that status, don't linger, and start linger this and that.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:58.940
 This detour, deterring your deviating of your directions, or our directions, directions, directions

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.240
.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:07.240
 And then, with this, when you have that confidence, confidence,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:17.240
 and then, whatever is arising is within the nature, within the dharmakaya status.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:24.240
 Whatever is arising is dharmakaya. What is happening is dharmakaya.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.240
 And therefore, we don't have to worry these and their things.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:35.240
 And therefore, that reason, when teaching many times, let it come, let it be, and let it go.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.240
 Good. Simply relax on that.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 And that is then known as, instantly, concentrating or liberating everything as it arises.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:54.240
 And that also means, not blocking something, not providing the expression, the power of the purpose

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.240
.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.240
 Nor are we going to invoke the power of the purpose.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:05.240
 Exactly should be as it is. And relaxing in that natural state.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.240
 And that is known as, three words of God ability above the two practices.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.240
 Very essential, like that.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.240
 So then, once you discover that, and then, now, you have to continually maintain.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.240
 Keep up that is known as meditation.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.240
 There is nothing else meditation than the keeping of what you discover.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.240
 The discover. And when you discover, do the meditation, exactly the same thing as I said.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240
 With the mind second, space section.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.240
 Same thing, with full of devotions, both each other, joy and appreciation.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.240
 And as well, as well as those four renoms and thoughts. Really, worry that.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.240
 And then, practice meditation. In the post meditation, also very poor, humble, simple.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.240
 Don't interrupt. Try to develop more common senses. Common senses.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:11.240
 And really, appreciation. And poor thoughts. And observing those samayas.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:17.240
 And then, as well as samaya, there is guided samayas and unguided samayas.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.240
 So, guided samaya is more in time of the, more in the post meditators.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.240
 Meditation state. Try to observe those as much as you can.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.680
 And then, occasionally, also applying to, you have the culpability of realization of exactly as it

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.240
 is.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:41.330
 And then, unguided. Unguided also. Those samayas, you can apply that to reinforce, strengthen of

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.240
 the guided samayas.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.240
 So, that is how, during the practicing of the tattoo brilliant.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.240
 And many of you, of course, you all know practicing.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.240
 So, this is some dead, but however, so this is what, when we started this.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.240
 That's really about this tattoo, you know, way to practice this.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.240
 And then, we talked a little more about that, how to meditate.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.240
 Those are the teaching here, making, those, for abiding, poor techniques.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:19.240
 Those, let me discuss. We discussed. And that's my brief talk today, for today, and we start.
