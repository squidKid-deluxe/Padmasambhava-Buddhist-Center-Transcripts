Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche explains the brief history of Buddha Akshobhya during the 2017 Windhorse Retreat at Padma Samye Ling on May 28, 2017.\n\nAkshobhya (Tib. Midrugpa) is the unshakeable Buddha of the East who purifies all negative karma, particularly karma related with heavy suffering and the causes for rebirth in the lower realms. Buddha Shakyamuni highly praised Akshobhya in many teachings, saying that just hearing his name and mantra would bring joy and peace to oneself and others, purify negative karma, and benefit those who are sick and dying. Connecting with Buddha Akshobhya will also help all beings achieve higher rebirth.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120
 As the Buddha came and gone, all these Buddha are not just going to come, this Buddha, Buddha

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.980
 Akshobhya, according to Buddha, is the living Buddha right now. In the Eastern direction

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.680
 of our world, in the Eastern direction, there is a universe known as Mopargava of extremely

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.600
 joyful to your land, that to your land, really living Buddha right now. So today we receive

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.680
 the empowerment, we receive the blessing, that means we're going to receive the blessings

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:46.960
 and as well as encouragement from this gracious living Buddha to activate our Buddha nature,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.720
 our own, these beautiful qualities. That is what really it is. So therefore, again, this

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.080
 Buddha Akshobhya is the living Buddha. Buddha Akshobhya, according to Buddha Shakyamuni's

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 teaching, there is a big suttara teaching in the Buddha Sakyamuni's teaching, Mahayana

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.280
 suttara, and that is called display of the Akshobhyas teaching. In that suttara, Buddha

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.680
 Shakyamuni mentioned that Akshobhya, once upon a time, he was bodhisattvas. He pursued

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.160
 to the, again, enlightenment, to develop the bodhicata and then he get to serve to all the

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.440
 living beings with love, with compassion, with kindness, with respect and appreciation, and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.720
 pursue that so strongly, so courageously, so fearlessly, and then he become the Buddha.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.600
 And Buddha Akshobhya's name is also in the Tibetan, it's called the Mantopa. Mantopa in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.080
 Sanskrit is Akshobhya. What means unshakable, undistable, means courage and commitment,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.080
 competence of that hope of the bodhicata to all the sentient beings cannot be disturbed,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.840
 cannot be undermined by any means. And that's really the meaning of the Buddha Akshobhya.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.760
 He carried that name, not just a name, but he had that meaning. He keep that will, willpower

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:16.120
 with that attitude, he practiced it, he did all the beneficial activities of the six parabuddhas

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.920
 and then applied as enlightened beings. So he become one of the great Buddha, particularly

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 the commitment of Akshobhya is known as the special Buddha for all those eagerly obscured

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 by the obscuration in the karmas. Again, this karma is there, of course, we all heard so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.400
 many times, but karma is according to the Buddha's city is one's own deed, one's own

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.960
 mistakes of our due to the self-importance. And because of self-importance, we acted with

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.560
 it, with it, such as very self-important attitude of the mind, which is known as the, such as

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.240
 attachment, grasping, clinging, anger and yellows and arrogance. All those are started with

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.200
 self-important or the ego clinging. With that thought, what is happening is when we have that

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.400
 thought, we don't see clearly exactly what things happen. We completely kind of in a way,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 intoxicated by these emotions. And we don't see clearly thinking of that, I'm going to defend.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 We have strong fears, fears or scared, we're going to lose something, and therefore we act

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.200
 that to kind of defend that. Then that defend is become the obstacle. Eventually, it is really

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 making its obstacle to us. Whatever we activate, we did activity with that, that is known as the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.440
 karma. It affected to the others, it affect to our self. And these negative emotions,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.240
 when it is activated, it not brings joy, peace, happiness to anyone. Not that person who is in

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.880
 that state is, is not happy, not peaceful. So essentially, it is a kind of purely, is a kind of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.320
 in a way, negativities. And therefore, it is then hurting to everyone, to you or to us,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.450
 to others. And that is not just completely there. That imprint stays. In the imprint stays,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.640
 according

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.440
 to the Buddha's teaching, it stays with the subconsciousness, strong house, or our mental state

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.560
 as printed. As printed. This is not just printed, that is also going to multiply. In a way,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.200
 we plant the seeds. Exactly as we plant the seed externally, when the farmer is paid, and it's

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.640
 all from large fruit berries. Similarly, our karma, we planted the seed in our mental state,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.320
 whether it is good or bad, but it goes these times, like under bad or difficult, the cause of the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.120
 difficulty troubles, and that bears many fruits. Those are known as heavy karmas. According to the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.160
 greatest teacher, Bodhaka Karmini's teaching, all that with beings are going through different

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.000
 challenges, difficult situation, is no other than really the karmic activities. Karmic are also,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.680
 as I said, it is, is one's own deed at the beginning times. And so, how are we going to

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.240
 clean? How are we going to purify that? No one else is going to clean for us. Also, we have to

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.600
 clean ourselves. We have to purify ourselves. Because we did ourselves at the best possible

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.800
 places, we should also clean away that by ourselves. And how are we going to clear that way? Really

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.800
,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.680
 full of joy, full of bodhijatha, full of kindness, full of hope, sense of peace, and such is the

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.080
 practice of the Buddha, Aktruvi. Then we can really clear away all those obscurations, and

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.110
 the difficulties it troubles. And the teaching often says that negative has no good qualities at

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.840
 all.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.600
 But one is really good quality, or good kind of part of the negativity, we can clean away,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.160
 we can clear away, remove that, that we can do. Otherwise, it don't have any good qualities.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.560
 And by this practice, such as Aktruviya, we can clear away that. Particularly, because

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:37.270
 all Buddhas, such as the Buddha, Aktruviya, Buddha, Magyushri, Kyanese, and Vajrasattvas, and Amit

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.880
abh,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.560
 ike Buddha, Ojyadryana, of course, all Buddhas, enlightened beings. Everyone is really Buddha.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:51.720
 But however, their previous commitment of the bodhijatha, each Buddha has a specialist to help

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 to the sentient beings. And Aktruviya is one of the very special help to all sentient beings to

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.120
 clear away, remove the heavy karma in the teaching said. Great. Buddha Shakyamuni repeatedly said,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.160
 Aktruviya is one of the really powerful practices to that, to clear away the karma, and as well as

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.240
 heavy karma. And heavy karma means, those are heavily bad karmas of the negativity that's

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.720
 saturated, and that really karmas make a lot of troubles. In particular, three low revs,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:31.320
 hell realms, hunger ghosts, and anima realms. And those realms, we practice the meditative

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.400
 through this Aktruviya, thinking of all those living beings, and then really it will help to

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.160
 all these beings, the core teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, and as well as all the great masters.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.760
 So this is what this Buddha Aktruviya is. Buddha Aktruviya can also understand similar

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:59.000
 as Buddha Vedya Sattva. Oh Buddha, Buddha as Aktruviya, Buddha Vedya Sattva, and all these

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.800
 Buddhas are very special Buddha and the purification. They are similar, they are like

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.000
 different emanation, they are different aspect of the to benefit to all the living beings,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.640
 to everyone. So therefore, this is known as now, Buddha Aktruviya. And as he said,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.520
 Buddha Aktruviya is the living Buddha right in the now, in the beyond of the Mopargava,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.840
 in the eastern directions, according to the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni. So that is

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.600
 what the Buddha Aktruviya is, and the Buddha Shakyamuni give highly, when the Buddha Shakyamuni

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.520
 give this teaching, he praised the Buddha Aktruviya so many times, and again, again. This is the

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.160
 Buddha,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.520
 when you like to have difficulty troubles with emotions such as anger, ignorance, attachment,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.640
 jealousness, hatred, thoughts, all the arrogance, if you are having difficulties,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.200
 ourself having that difficulty, it's good to practice Aktruviya. If you see someone else having

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.000
 that difficulty troubles, if we practice in meditation on the Aktruviya, that really will

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.240
 help that. And this, so therefore, Aktruviya is one of the special Buddhas to really claim

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:16.920
 all the negative emotions and result of the negative emotions. So that is the one really

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.880
 Buddha Aktruviya teaches. And then the Buddha Aktruviya teaching is a very popular practice to

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.120
 all Advaita Buddhisms. Every Advaita Buddhism practicing, really practicing, this Buddha

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.480
 Aktruviya is very popular. But this, generally, this teaching is particularly connected to the

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:39.000
 numerous schools of Advaita Buddhisms. Generally, Buddhism came to Advaita in the 8th century as

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.160
 Aktruviyu. In the 8th century and worldwide, great Gopi Masambhava, Maastrichtanda Ratna,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.480
 and the characters of Devdity, they all come together, established in the poor, poor body of

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:59.160
 the Buddhism in the Tibetans. And this, then, ever since, it really becomes one of the very

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.560
 beautiful and very rich country of the Buddhisms, really. They've been practicing. They're not just

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.760
 the only Buddhism established at the academic level, but they've been practicing, meditating

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.440
 exactly what the Buddha told, Maastrichtanda Ratna told, or the great Master Chanda Ratna told,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.600
 they practiced it. And within that time, that era, in the 8th century,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.080
 so many Tibetan practitioners really reached enlightenment, highest realization, by practicing

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.320
 both men and females. And then that inspired so many Tibetans and become so calm and peaceful,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:43.000
 so many poor beings like that. And then teaching was strongly rooted in the Tibet until now.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.680
 And the Tibetan become one of the beautiful, really Buddhist countries. Countries, and of course,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.280
 there is always difficulty, travelers, and all the emotional problems. But comparing to the many

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.760
 other, those different histories, looking to the Tibet, I think it's one of the really quite good,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.400
 peaceful countries because of the duty of this great teaching of the Buddha Chachamundi. So this,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.770
 this. And then, of course, this, also in Maastrichtanda Ratna, there are many, many teachings of

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:12.920
 the

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.640
 actual being practiced in this summary. But this particular teaching is then brought by,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:26.200
 by great Master Nyanggukung Rinpoche. He put together a great title known as, yes,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:45.160
 great title known as "Ketin Sathya Jamsi." Sathya Jamsi, and this is the one who revere that

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.800
 teaching,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.840
 but great Master Nyanggukung Rinpoche, who put together, added this so that he put more,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.360
 more kind of blessed again with these teachings of the Tirtung Sathya Jamsi. And that was the,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:06.040
 was how this teaching is came. And this teaching, again, become very popular teaching. And to be

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.960
 Buddhism, it is a part of the collection of all the Nyingma Therma teachings by, that done by the

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.760
 great Master Nyanggukung Rinpoche, with the encouragement of the great Master Pasle Chintze.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.760
 Pasle Chintze and Pasle Kuntze, they become the, one of the greatest, or some of the greatest

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.040
 masters in the very Buddhist history, or maybe in the Buddhist history. They really become

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.410
 so great masters. They are learning, they are realizing of beings, and they are full of, full, full

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.440
,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:42.360
 full of the love and the compassion of the Muslims. From there, through every aspect that you look

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:42.520
 to

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.200
 them, they are the perfect beings, the really beautiful beings, such as, of all the teachings

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.160
 of the Buddha, from the morality, to the concentration, to the wisdom level. And that

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.200
 was also known as in Buddhism, three extraordinary trainings of the practice,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.240
 extraordinary practices of the morality, extraordinary practice of the concentration,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:12.200
 extraordinary practice of the wisdoms. Truly they become the one of the, or some of the great

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:19.080
 masters who have kept up that yet so humble, so simple, full of wisdom, full of compassion,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.800
 have thought for really just these masters. So these are the timely master came, just before

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.680
 today, they're going to have the big troubles. They gather all those teachings, put them together,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.760
 and a particular term of teaching by this great master, Jungkook Jungkook, as I said, encouragement

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.000
 and support from the, all guidance from the, from the first chances. So this is the part of this

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 teaching, and those, this teaching becomes very popular, and contains ongoing religious teachings

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.200
 now. Now, and this teaching, I also particularly received this teaching from Katyapati Charanmuthi,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:04.920
 that is really my introduction of these ceremonies. Now we go to the, actually, empowerment.
