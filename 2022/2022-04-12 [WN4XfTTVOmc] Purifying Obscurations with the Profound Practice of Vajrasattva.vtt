00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580
 So, in this sense, we're reflecting on all these beautiful, precious teachings we've been

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.500
 so fortunate to get and think about. And of course, what's even more precious and more

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.780
 meaningful and actually more beneficial is when we can absorb those teachings into our

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:31.820
 minds and hearts and become more and more natural. Again, the main point of the Buddhist

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:44.460
 teachings is to remove our obscurations. Why? Because that reveals our inherent nature.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.880
 And so, the main focus of today's contemplation and reflecting and what we're going to focus

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.000
 on more within the Ngondro teachings is the Vajrasattva practice of purifying our obscurations

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.920
 and using this great, powerful support of the Vajrasattva meditation and recitation.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.980
 So we'll go over that a little bit. Well, I think the most important thing, you know,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.380
 the teachings are always pointing out to us to remember. So we're not too caught up in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:29.020
 the gross kind of rough illusion. It's to remember the wisdom of the Buddhist teachings

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 and the big, big, beautiful, true view that we all have Buddha nature, that our innate

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 nature is limitless wisdom, intelligence, inseparable from loving kindness and the capacity to imme

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.420
asurably

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 benefit every living being who doesn't recognize their true nature and help mature them, bring

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.640
 them to that realization. We all have beautiful nature. Again, it's just the degree to which

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.900
 we recognize it or not is the only difference. So, like it says in one of the tantras of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:27.160
 the Buddha, the Heavantra Tantra, all beings are Buddhas by nature, but it's temporarily

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:37.860
 concealed by advantageous stains of perception. So, I mean, that's just such a critically

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.260
 important thing to recognize as we take refuge in the three jewels and the three roots and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.320
 in our practice, is having some degree of more confidence and trust in the truth of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.660
 the Buddha's realization. But at the heart of that is our own potential and our own just

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.900
 natural goodness is there at the heart of everything, whether we recognize it or not.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.580
 And so, really, it's said in the teachings that the path of awakening to our bodhicitta,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.900
 to our absolute bodhicitta, to our true Buddhahood, to realizing the great perfection, that path

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:35.300
 is really removing our obscurations. As we remove our obscurations in the teachings,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:46.300
 our innate Buddha nature, innate wisdom and our natural compassion, all of those qualities

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:55.700
 we all have are more fully developed and shining, the more our obscurations are revealed. Our

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.620
 obscurations are revealed to us and then we remove them. So, that's really that point.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.200
 If we didn't have Buddha nature, there'd be no reason to practice. Our Buddha nature

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:22.080
 is the cause of our enlightenment. So, that's just like the example when we have dirty hands,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:30.220
 it's not that our hands are dirty, it's that we have dirt on our hands as a rough metaphor.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.060
 When a window is really dirty and hard to see through, it's not that the window itself

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.100
 is dirty, it's that there's dirt on the window and we wash it. And if we put all those ingredients

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:53.940
 together, the soap, the water, the friction, the rinse, then the result is there. We see

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.980
 what was there to begin with. And so, that's, I think, really important to remember as we're

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:20.540
 practicing. Our obscurations are what obscures us from recognizing our Buddha nature. So,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.860
 the Buddha initially gave, the very first teaching the Buddha gave in this human world,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:36.820
 the Four Noble Truths, the truth of suffering, the truth that there's not just suffering

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:48.600
 and challenges, but there's causes for suffering and challenges. Those causes are our

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.980
 misunderstanding

00:05:50.980 --> 00:06:00.860
 of things as they are, our ego clinging, our negative emotions and grasping are what perpetuate

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:11.640
 our suffering, which perpetuate our samsara. So, samsara and suffering and obscurations,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.340
 they're all one and the same. Then, of course, the Buddha didn't just teach their suffering

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.020
 and causes for suffering. He's pointing out from the most basic Buddhism and then just

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.760
 becomes more and more direct what the Buddha is pointing out and directing, ushering our

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:39.100
 minds towards realizing is that there's freedom from suffering. There's cessation of suffering,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:48.380
 the truth of cessation of suffering. And then there's causes for that. There's ways and

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:57.540
 methods to remove the causes of our suffering and bring out our innate nature. And so that's

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:06.380
 what the path we have, these are the teachings we have to explore and to try out and apply

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:20.340
 to our lives. How beautiful. And so again, just kind of returning to that point, its

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:33.390
 obscurations are samsara, who samsara are samsara. Everything comes down to our own mind and

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.260
 recognizing

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.980
 its qualities and removing our obscurations. And so all of our nundro practice is doing

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.720
 that. And then with the Vajrasattva section in particular, we're kind of really focusing

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.060
 on that. But again, as we'll talk as we go, none of the nundro is kind of really completely

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:09.740
 separate from another. It's all bringing out beautiful aspects of that one whole practice.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:23.960
 So again, I took a few little notes so I didn't get too lost in space here. So as far as obsc

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.380
urations

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:35.060
 go, as far as samsara goes, and finding the way to remove the causes of samsara and bring

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:41.140
 out those beautiful nature, those are all the methods we have of the foundational Buddhism,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:48.700
 of Mahayana Buddhism, of Vajrayana Buddhism, all working in unity. That's what we're practicing

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:59.420
 here. And so as far as obscurations go, it's told, there's how many obscurations? Basically

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:07.100
 two obscurations is one. Again, we may have heard this, we may have not heard this. But

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.380
 again, what makes all the difference is how much each one of us, myself included, really

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:21.060
 contemplates this and really brings it to heart. So what are the two obscurations? They're

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:34.620
 called emotional obscurations and conceptual obscurations or knowledge obscurations. Emotional

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:43.380
 and conceptual. Emotional obscurations are much more rough, much more kind of our outer

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:50.820
 samsara experience, the real rough stuff we notice first and engage with most often. But

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:58.860
 of course it's all based on our knowledge obscurations, our very, very, very subtle

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:06.260
 obscurations that are, you know, come right down to our basic not knowing. But now these

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:14.500
 two obscurations are sometimes broken down into four obscurations where emotional obscurations

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:23.780
 can be looked at two ways and conceptual obscurations looked at two ways. And so that's known as

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.180
 karmic obscurations as far as the emotional obscurations can be broken down, kind of to

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.420
 look at a little bit more, parse them out a little bit more, look at them a little more

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:44.980
 clearly. Karmic obscurations and then our negative emotions, the obscurations of our

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:52.420
 negative emotions. So our karmic obscurations are, again, the word karmic is there because

00:10:52.420 --> 00:11:04.740
 they're involved with our actions, our actions of body, speech, mind. And right, so those

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:14.140
 are all caused by how we see things, our emotions, how much ignorance we have, how much hope

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:24.560
 and fear we have, how many actions of our bodies and speech and habitual mind we have.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:32.180
 And so one way of understanding that is kind of from the ordinary level for every being

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:38.300
 whatsoever there's two kinds of karmic obscurations or two kinds of ways in which we act that

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.580
 cause more trouble for ourselves and others directly and indirectly. And those are sometimes

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:56.900
 called natural, kind of natural karmic activities and kind of fabricated. So what does that

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:08.780
 mean? So natural karmic activities are things like killing, stealing, abusive behavior,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:17.180
 hatred, you know, hatred, thoughts and actions, for example. That's all no matter what everybody's

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:26.220
 harmed, we're harmed, others are harmed, doesn't matter. And then what's called more fabricated

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.940
 karma is then more involved with our mind and as dharma practitioners. On the basic

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:43.240
 level that means when we make a promise and go against it. And so then on levels of taking

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.340
 the Buddhist teachings that would mean, you know, so in other words also that could be

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:55.580
 all the kind of customs and laws and regulations just in the ordinary world and wherever we

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:02.180
 are, those are kind of acting against those can cause us trouble on some degree, right.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:08.900
 And then on the spiritual level, when we begin to take like vows of the pratimoksha, whether

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:18.020
 we're lay or non or monk, the vows we take there as the path of individual liberation,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:29.460
 not to kill, not to steal, not avoid sexual misconduct, you know, etc, etc. And then the

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:40.420
 vows we can take as bodhisattva, seeing every single being as our mother, really engaging

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:50.180
 with the bodhicitta, all the vows we take as bodhisattva, all our bodhisattva vows in conviction.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:14:00.500
 And then what we take on as Vajrayana practitioners of the purity. These are examples of fabricated

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:00.500
.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:06.900
 But when it's so involved again, what makes all the difference with karma, the Buddha

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:14.500
 taught is how we feel about our actions, how much we think about them when we think and

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:21.940
 how we really feel about them, when we whether it's positive, negative, neutral. If we think

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:28.300
 about doing something and we feel good about it, that's first really powerful ingredient

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:35.220
 for powerful karma. When we think about something and feel good about it, and then we do it,

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.780
 and we feel good about it as we're doing it, that makes it even more powerful. When we

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:47.100
 continue that action and bring it to fulfillment and still feel good about it, that makes it

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:53.980
 all the most powerful, it's going to have the most powerful effect for ourselves and

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:12.740
 others and ultimately, you know, in our own experience. And so, that's just something

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:22.140
 to keep in mind with looking at our karmic, karmic obscurations. And they do intersect,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:31.100
 for example, in the teachings, it's taught, for example, killing. Every people are harmed

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:38.700
 when we kill, but if we haven't taken a vow not to kill out of great reverence for life,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.060
 then maybe killing doesn't have quite the same karmic effect as if someone who's really

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:52.780
 vowed not to kill. And then again, just being sober and like really recognizing the magnitude

00:15:52.780 --> 00:16:00.060
 and the beautiful power of our practice when we have our bodhicitta intention and motivation

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:06.300
 and conviction and a vow in front of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas to actualize our

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:14.940
 bodhicitta for the benefit of all living beings. If we kill, what is that doing? That's even

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:21.620
 more powerfully going against kind of these vows. And then on the Vajrayana level, seeing

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:28.740
 all the apparent existence, all phenomena as the pure mandala of all the Buddhas, three

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:37.860
 Kaya mandala, then what are we doing when we kill? Again, we can get complicated, but the

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:45.180
 point is all of the vows we take are to help usher us, to help protect us, to help keep

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:52.300
 us on the path. But they're beautiful, powerful means, you know, skillful means for bringing

00:16:52.300 --> 00:17:01.380
 out our goodness qualities and cherishing our motivation and our intention is so important

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.620
 and beautiful. That's what's going to always bring us back to the right path and make all

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:12.860
 the difference for the future, no matter what mistakes we make. So anyway, I was talking

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:19.620
 about habitual, no, about karmic obscurations. And then of course, emotional obscurations

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:26.380
 are the other part of that, the breakdown. And what are our emotional obscurations? That's

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:33.700
 essentially we could look at the 84,000 emotions, which can be summarized as the five poisons

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:49.660
 or the five basic emotions, ignorance, attachment, arrogance, jealousy, anger, you know, and

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:59.340
 that can be broken down into the three basic emotions of ignorance, aversion, attachment,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:06.860
 you know, that basic again, the basic not knowing of ignorance. And then keeping that

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:14.060
 in all of our actions of hope and fear, it's those things that propel all of our karmic

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:21.700
 obscurations. So the less ego clinging we have, the less grasping we have, the more

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:28.420
 we contemplate the teachings and practice, the more we're, we're more likely to refrain

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:36.780
 from harm, engage and benefit, take responsibility for our own mind and our own actions and our

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:46.300
 own liberation, and with the motivation to benefit others. And then again, just to go

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:52.940
 a little bit more quickly now, as far as looking at the two obscurations as for like we talked

00:18:52.940 --> 00:19:00.140
 about, emotional obscurations looked at as karmic and emotional. And now as far as our

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:07.180
 conceptual obscurations, that's again, on a little more very subtle level, looking on

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:17.740
 more subtle level of our samsara. That has to do with our basic ignorance and misperception

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:24.420
 of how things are. So that can be broken down into what's called conceptual obscurations,

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:31.020
 and then the habitual obscurations. Our conceptual obscurations, really the way that's summed

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:40.780
 up in the teachings is, that's the habit we all have of subject, object, action. I am,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:48.180
 the world exists, and there's the interactions between that we substantially, that I exist,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:54.460
 the world substantially exists, and there's activity. On whatever level, that habitual

00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:02.380
 pattern is an obscuration, because the Buddha taught, that's actually not how things are

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:12.340
 deep down. It's vast freedom, always shining, always moving. And then the fourth obscuration

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:22.180
 is more the habitual, and that is very, very, very, very subtle conceptual obscurations,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:31.380
 kind of very subtle echoes of these conceptual obscurations that are purified. It's sometimes

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:38.980
 said that that's like if you have a box that had perfume in it, or a bottle with perfume,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:45.680
 and there's no more perfume, but you still smell the fragrance. It's like that level.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.580
 So again, the point of this is too, all we've heard as our progress on the path from beginning

00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:00.340
 up through realizing the true nature to total Buddhahood, when we look at that from the

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:08.820
 point of obscurations, that's like the Buddha pointed out, right? These kind of signposts

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:14.380
 and indications of our progress on the path, and as far as how that relates to removing

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:21.740
 our obscurations, if we start by cutting down our rough activity of listening to the teachings,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:28.140
 applying the teachings, gradually we take them on more and more, we're purifying, we're

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:35.740
 refraining from harm, engaging in benefit, generating merit, generating our wisdom and

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:42.440
 purifying by those means. And then there's what's called the five paths, or one way of

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:51.820
 the Buddha showed us of progressing the kind of a basic map for signposts of our realization.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:59.480
 And when we first begin, those five paths are what, the path of accumulation, the path of

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:12.420
 joining, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no more learning. So one way in

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.100
 the teachings, again, this is kind of just as a way of connecting with seeing how removing

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:23.620
 our obscurations and the causes of our obscurations, the causes of our suffering, the causes of

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:39.460
 our challenges, the causes of our mess, that's the path. And so, for example, when we perfected

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:46.780
 the path of accumulation, maybe that's when we've really cut, really truly, deeply cut

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:59.300
 off our karmic obscurations. And then when we've really, really perfected the path of

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:10.060
 joining an application, we've really perfected and cleaned away, totally abandoned our emotional

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:17.980
 obscurations. And that means, right, then the next, the path of seeing, when we see the

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:29.140
 great emptiness as it is, subject, object, action, beyond all, any way we could stand

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.860
 it up or see it intellectually, see the true nature as it is, the great emptiness, so clear

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:47.220
 and vibrant. That's when our conceptual habitual, our conceptual obscurations are purified. And

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.060
 then again, in the path of meditation, moving up through all the bhoomis, that's when these

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:58.900
 very, very subtle obscurations are purified. And when that happens, then it's the path

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:04.460
 of no more learning, which is to say, there's no more to purify. All our naturally inherent

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:12.060
 enlightened qualities are fully awakened, fully developed, completely purified. We're

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:20.020
 Buddhists and we're object of refuge for all beings, just acting naturally for the benefit

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:28.860
 of beings appearing to them as needed. And now, as ordinary sentient beings, we're in

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:38.220
 the beautiful place of having a teacher, of having these perfect teacher who has so beautifully

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:51.240
 maintained these beautiful, precious teachings that help us to awaken to that. And so, like

00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:01.240
 I'm getting at, obscurations are our samsara. Removing them, purifying our obscurations

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:10.020
 is the path. Another word that Rinpoche uses often, you know, for obscurations and kind

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:19.820
 of violations of our vows and Samayas and our promises is mistakes. So recognizing our

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:32.260
 mistakes is the path, a big part of the path and how beautiful we shouldn't be afraid.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:39.860
 Because again, like the Buddha taught, there's more than suffering and its causes. Our fundamental

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:53.220
 nature is beautiful, is peace, is wisdom, is love, compassion, freedom, bodhichitta.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:26:13.780
 How beautiful. And so, when we have, get to our Vajrasattva practice, which I guess if

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:23.660
 you have the sadhana is page 32 in this book. Purification of obscurations, the meditation

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:41.460
 of Vajrasattva. So simple, so concise, so profound. Again, it's the whole path. So,

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:53.660
 it's renowned as this Vajrasattva practice. We have what is known as the four supports,

00:26:53.660 --> 00:27:07.040
 the four powers of purification to purify. And that's known as the power of the object,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:17.580
 the power of uprooting, the power of actually purifying, uprooting obscurations, the power

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:31.540
 of restoring, and then the power of the antidote. So in brief, the power of the object in this

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:44.780
 sense is Vajrasattva, the Buddha Vajrasattva. And now, that can be understood as this is

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:53.670
 called the outer Vajrasattva. The outer Vajrasattva is the Buddha Vajrasattva, known as the

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.180
 sovereign

00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:02.380
 of all the Buddha mandalas. Embodiment of all the Buddhas is Vajrasattva. Vajrasattva is

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:12.100
 so prime, so important, it's renowned as the Lord of all mandalas. Embodiment of all the

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:21.460
 Buddhas of the past, present, future. And Vajrasattva is actually the root teacher of

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:35.060
 the Dzogchen, teachings, even on the lineage way. And it's said again, when Vajrasattva

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:44.020
 was manifest as an ordinary being on the path of learning, like so many great noble beings,

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:51.420
 as a great bodhisattva, similar to Amitabha's, he made great vast aspiration. You know, may

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:59.460
 any being who hears my name and practices on me, may all of their obscurations be completely

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:07.260
 purified. And by the power of the truth of my conviction, the truth of my actions, the

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:13.260
 truth of my word, if this can't happen, may I only achieve enlightenment and Buddhahood

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:21.420
 if this is possible. And then again, through the great power and joy and love and true

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:27.660
 conviction and joy of that animating that intention and that thought. And then that

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:33.580
 that was followed through with all of the skillful means and actualizing his bodhicitta

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:39.300
 all the way to Buddhahood. You know, through the power of all those coming together, that's

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:45.660
 made this inseparable connection we have in this renowned practice of Vajrasattva. So

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:51.740
 that's Vajrasattva on the outer level. And then it's really, again, important to recognize

00:29:51.740 --> 00:30:02.820
 inner Vajrasattva, who is the inner Vajrasattva. And the teachings, the inner Vajrasattva is

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:15.580
 our own devotion. The inner Vajrasattva is our joy and our appreciation. Inner Vajrasattva

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:25.380
 is our refuge, our closeness feeling, our trust in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. It's

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:35.580
 our bodhicitta. It's our deep confidence and joy, devotion, trust, closeness feeling with

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:44.420
 the true nature and with the lineage and with our teacher. That's the inner, inner Vajrasattva.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.780
 And then it's our practice, right, that's joining the two of making the union of the

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:58.460
 actualized Vajrasattva with our joy, our devotion is the breath that creates our, you know,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:06.260
 our union, removes our obscurations. That's the power of the object. Then we have the

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:16.380
 power of uprooting. Again, we're uprooting our obscurations. And that means we're recognizing

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:24.060
 a mistake as a mistake. Like it said, it's so renowned, the teaching of the Buddha, you

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:30.640
 know, the words of the Buddha. The only good thing about mistakes and negative actions

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:37.980
 is that the only good thing about them is they can be purified. So recognizing a mistake

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:50.420
 as a mistake is wonderful, though we all know how painful it can be. But that's kind of

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:57.340
 where the power of restoration comes in and the power of the antidote. But uprooting means

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:03.980
 recognizing a mistake as a mistake. And again, let's remember too, there's different ways

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:11.500
 we make mistakes. We make mistakes, the most common way we can make mistakes is by just

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:17.880
 not knowing, not knowing better, not knowing how things are, not knowing the effects of

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:24.940
 our actions and our attitudes for ourselves and others, not knowing is a major way we

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:35.180
 make mistakes. Another way we make mistakes is through maybe we know or we've heard but

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:50.500
 we forget. Another third way we make mistake out of the four is maybe we know better but

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.700
 for whatever reasons out of disrespect and disregarding what we do know of the laws of

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:03.140
 karma, the inevitability of cause and effect, for whatever reasons out of disrespect we

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:12.340
 go against what we know is better. The fourth way we make mistakes is even though we know

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:19.180
 better and we really want to do better, our emotions get the best of us and we're distracted

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:24.620
 by our emotions. These are the main ways we make mistakes, whether it's in the ordinary

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:30.980
 world with kind of the promises we make for ourselves and others or you know kind of the

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:39.140
 ways we go about just acting in the world as ordinary beings, the same as on whatever

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:46.580
 ways we're working on the pratimoksha level of our practice or the bodhisattva level of

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.420
 our practice or the vidyadhara mantra on the level of our practice. These are the four

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:59.260
 ways we make mistakes and when we're recognizing a mistake as a mistake it's good and as soon

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.940
 as we recognize a mistake we should purify it. That's the best way they say like cleaning

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:12.220
 the lamp while it's hot. So that's to say like using the metaphor like if you have candles

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:20.380
 on your shrine, wax candles, or this is referring to like a butter lamp, if the lamp goes out

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:26.180
 and there's the wax there, if you clean it right away while it's still hot, the wax is

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:32.220
 still hot and the lamp is still hot, it's so easy but if we let it sit you know the

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:38.020
 wax gets hard, it's really harder to get out and it's similar on the level of our mistakes.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:43.800
 If we recognize a mistake as a mistake but we don't do anything to really look at it

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:50.000
 clearly and really feel how we feel about it and really recognize it was a mistake and

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.820
 try to purify it then it just becomes more heavy and harder to becomes more habitual

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:07.100
 essentially. So we want to purify a mistake as soon as we can and so that's why it's important

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.220
 you know when we're doing going through again as we're doing these four powers they're all

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:19.980
 working together, Vajrasattva, we're uprooting, we're recognizing our mistakes as mistakes,

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:31.060
 we're then the fourth power, we're restoring, we're feeling that deep remorse not shying

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.980
 away from it but we're not punishing ourselves or beating ourselves up for it, we're just

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:47.940
 truly purely feeling the remorse of the mistakes we've made, really connecting with that, that's

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:54.300
 the power of restoring so not only feeling the remorse but again connecting with well

00:35:54.300 --> 00:36:01.420
 what's our really true intention and our true wish, what do we really hold dear and true

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:07.700
 and valuable but to really how do we really wish we had behaved, what do we want how do

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.420
 we want to act in the future from this moment on you know that's what's going to help not

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.820
 to repeat you know have that strong conviction not to repeat our mistakes which means what

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.140
 makes really helps direct that is knowing what we also want to do, where we want to

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:30.740
 go, what view we want to hold, what conduct we really cherish and want to uphold and respect

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:40.920
 in order to actualize our bodhicitta and so therefore it said as we're uprooting and restoring

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:51.660
 really feeling that living presence of our own teacher of this life is with us, inseparable

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:59.780
 from all the buddhas of the three times manifest as glorious vajrasattva whose omniscient who

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:10.380
 sees everything all of our misdeeds misunderstandings whether we recognize it or not the buddhas

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:19.500
 see clearly you know so just again really calling to mind as we're uprooting our mistakes

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.940
 it's it's really given in the teachings really look at them square on really call to mind

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:32.400
 into heart the mistakes we've made with our loved ones in the world the way we've gone

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.500
 all the like if we want to look at the ten non-virtues of body speech mind we've engaged

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.900
 with or want to look at on whatever level the vows we've taken before the buddhas and

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:51.980
 bodhisattvas before our precious teachers living teachers in this world you know any

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.900
 ways we've gone against are the promises we've made with ourselves and our precious lineage

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:06.340
 looking at that squarely clearly anything the smallest harm to big big mistakes look

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.620
 at them remembering the time the place the motivation calling it to heart and then of

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.340
 course there's so many things we're completely unaware of again if we look at these four

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:21.560
 ways we make mistakes all the things we've done just not knowing better not having the

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:27.740
 complete picture you know where our arrogance gets the better of us where our emotions get

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:33.860
 the better of us whatever it is really looking at it and then fundamentally knowing we just

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:40.620
 don't see there's so much we don't see and don't know including the deepest level that

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.680
 we haven't recognized our pure nature that's the ultimate mistake and the big stain we're

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:57.280
 cleaning right so really not shying away from that and then with that remorse that we feel

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:03.980
 letting that instead of beating ourselves up or feeling bad about it taking full responsibility

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:10.540
 and really bringing it back to what is our true motivation really having that conviction

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:17.540
 of the fourth power I do not to repeat restoring our vows means what we're going to refrain

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:24.300
 from doing in the future with our real conviction not to repeat and more so what we really value

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:31.860
 and are going to engage with as far as our bodhicitta and our our practice and then we're

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:39.580
 using the fourth power the power of the antidote which is again part of all of this but then

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:47.580
 as we do the practice when we get to it maybe what we'll do is I'm talking a little bit

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:53.720
 long now let's start our practice and when we get to the the power of the antidote that's

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:02.100
 where again we use this skillful means practice of visualizing Vajrasattva inseparable from

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:09.420
 the teacher so we'll go over once we get to that part in the practice we'll go over visualizing

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:16.380
 Vajrasattva above our head in yabhiyam with nyema you know with the nectar is coming cleansing

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:24.460
 us removing all of our obscurations the causes and results of our obscurations clarifying

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:32.220
 purifying all of our karmic debts until the whole universe is just purified and revealed

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:39.260
 as the three kaya mandala of Vajrasattva and then we just abide in that nature which is

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:50.380
 the ultimate purification of resting in Rigpa so that's using the four powers so once we

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:56.000
 get to that we'll just review that aspect a little bit and now I'll stop talking I hope

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.300
 this is helpful of course the Dharma is so vast so profound there's so many details but

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:08.260
 just kind of touching on some of these really basic elements purifying our obscurations

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:16.600
 that it's our obscurations are all that's veiling us from experiencing the beautiful

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.740
 enlightened nature and really letting our bodhichitta be totally natural in its full

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:31.260
 bloom state and using these skillful means to purify our gross emotions and conceptions

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:39.260
 to the most all the way to Buddhahood that's the path and then this is all like why we're

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:47.340
 embodiment of our precious teacher embodiment of all the Buddhas alive and living in this

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:55.020
 life receiving those blessings mingling our own mind with the mind of the fully enlightened

00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:07.220
 Buddha and resting in that state wonderful so let's do that we'll just rest for a few

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:15.060
 moments in silence and then we'll we'll quickly with a heart and mind of bodhichitta aspiration

 benefits of all sentient parent beings from now until samsara becomes empty I shall accomplish the

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:36.150
 state of our own innate rickpa all the blessings of vajrasattva so again power of the object vajras

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:36.820
attva

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:46.660
 the outer vajrasattva uniting with our inner vajrasattva of our joy devotion our bodhicitta

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:53.620
 that's that's what's removing all of our obscurations and the veils of our delusion

01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:00.340
 purifying bringing out the beautiful immaculate state of the nature and bodhicitta

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:09.620
 and then we're purifying of our mistakes recognizing our mistakes

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:16.660
 clearly as much as we can and of course as we all know as you're doing the practice sometimes

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:23.140
 we begin to even remember things we totally forgot but to some degree recognize our mistakes

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:32.340
 clearly vividly feeling our remorse recognizing so much we don't know including just the true

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:42.340
 nature acknowledging that too and connecting with our beautiful motivation to not repeat our

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:42.980
 mistakes

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:51.460
 and to what we truly do want to engender to actualize our bodhicitta to really be less and

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:58.820
 less you know obsessed with our samsara and its causes and more and more engaged with

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:06.500
 the cause of happiness for ourselves and all beings the path of liberation and truly wishing

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:12.820
 to absorb that into our minds and hearts and realization bring out our bodhicitta and purity

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:21.620
 awareness however we want to term it and then using the power of the antidote so here we are

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.740
 the precious teacher

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:35.060
 who has the precious instructions and nectar blessings to really record for us to recognize

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:42.820
 our true nature so like it says above one's head is vatrasattva inseparable from the lama

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:51.940
 so our own precious living teacher of this life inseparable from guru patma sambhava

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:58.500
 inseparable from vatrasattva embodiment of all the buddhas of the three times

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:08.020
 is vividly clearly feel that presence right above our crown i say about one cubit one forearm

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.420
 length

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:19.160
 above our head is vatrasattva and how is vatrasattva appearing in this specific practice vatrasatt

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.460
va

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:29.220
 from our the the crown of our head coming out from our central channel is a luminous stem and then

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:34.260
 again one cubit above our head is a thousand petal white lotus

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:45.060
 pure brilliant white on that is a on the pollen bed of the thousand petal lotus is a beautiful

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:53.380
 pristine white moon disc lying on the the pollen bed on that is glorious vatrasattva you know

01:13:53.380 --> 01:14:06.740
 with one one face two arms two legs brilliant white like they say like um a million suns

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:14.180
 shining on a pure snow mountain this brilliant white and adorned you know wearing all the

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:22.020
 sambhogakaya ornaments the crowns silks and scarves and jewels and bells and then

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:29.540
 in vatrasattva's right hand is of course holding the vadra at the heart and then in the left hand

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:38.900
 holding uh the bell jubu at the hip and in this practice too then vatrasattva is above us in

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:47.140
 yabium in union with the great wisdom consort nemma who's also brilliant white in sambhogakaya

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:56.660
 posture in sambhogakaya dress and then she has her complexion has brilliant white but then a

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:04.100
 little reddish tinge and she's holding in her right hand a curved knife and in her left hand

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:11.300
 skull cup full of ambrosia of wisdom nectar her right arm is around vatrasattva's neck

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:18.580
 and there again in union the inseparable union of wisdom and compassion of emptiness and

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.380
 appearances

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:24.500
 is vatrasattva and then in vatrasattva's heart

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:34.820
 is again a little moon lotus and moon disc and standing on that in vatrasattva's heart

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:43.060
 is a little crystal five-pointed vadra and then in the five-pointed vadra

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:49.380
 in the heart the source of all phenomena of the vadra is a hung syllable

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:58.020
 the letter hung and then wrote to shining brilliantly with brilliant white

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:06.580
 circulating clockwise around that all the the syllables of the hundred syllable mantra are

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:13.140
 resounding and shining out throughout all the galaxies throughout all the buddha realms

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:23.780
 throughout all samsara and vatrasattva in union above our head the great teacher is then just

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.540
 shining the brilliant wisdom light and full of bliss and freedom and bodhicitta and kindness

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:37.060
 and omniscience again seeing every single thing as it is and knowing us so deeply so profoundly

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:43.860
 and then ourselves with them as witness kind of purifying recognizing our mistakes and not knowing

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:52.580
 purifying and then from the great bliss of our of vatrasattva kind of a nectar stream is dripping

01:16:52.580 --> 01:17:01.060
 and and kind of showering us and just moving through us cleansing our gross body cleansing

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:07.620
 our subtle body kind of we can imagine too they say that nectar stream is coming down and filling

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:14.180
 our central channel and moving throughout all the channels of our our body and through all the

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:23.140
 junctures of our channels all of our chakras are becoming pure and full of this wisdom light just

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:30.820
 shining brilliant white with all the five colors scintillating shining you know just really filling

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:38.340
 all of our channels overflowing purifying all of our negativities and all our negativities

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:45.700
 can be visualized as kind of being washed out as all kinds of disease and you know sometimes they

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:54.820
 say visualize as insects and you know just filth going and then also that all of our our

01:17:54.820 --> 01:18:01.780
 obscurations and their causes are completely purified and then true the ground is even opening

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:11.460
 up and all of the beings to which we have karmic debts all of our our karmic debts are purified

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:18.980
 they receive everything they need everything they ever wanted everything they need for

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:25.540
 temporary and ultimate peace is completely satisfied all of our our own obscurations and

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:31.940
 our karmic debts are completely purified and this is all as we're reciting the 100 syllable mantra

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:38.980
 removing using the four powers usually this visualization if you want to like i don't know

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:46.500
 if anyone's done this but if you're ever one way is if you imagine like if you're ever standing out

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:52.100
 or you have the opportunity and there's like a you have like a hose or something and it's a bright

01:18:52.100 --> 01:19:00.100
 blue sky in the sun and if you like kind of point the the water up in the air into the sun and just

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:06.020
 that brilliant light shining through the clear water just the nectar is just streaming and flowing

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:11.860
 and purifying ourselves and all of our relations and all of our connections and all beings without

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:20.420
 exception you know until eventually everyone is completely purified and revealed in the three kaya

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:28.980
 state of vatrasatva all appearances all forms are the enlightened body of vatrasatva all sound and

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:35.620
 movement is the enlightened speech of vatrasatva and the mantra of vatrasatva all thoughts and

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:42.100
 conceptions and perceptions are the mind of vatrasatva just that three kaya state all is the pure

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.700
 land of vatrasatva so we're reciting the hundred syllable mantra and then in this last stage where

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:55.700
 things are purifying then vatrasatva kind of comes into light and comes down into our heart

01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:02.740
 and then we recite the six syllable mantra of vatrasatva for a while just again contemplating

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:09.940
 visualizing all all existence all phenomena is the pure land of three kaya state of vatrasatva

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:19.140
 and then eventually we can then just bring our mind to the the hong and the the syllable going

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:26.900
 and then the syllable kind of dissolves into the hong the six syllables and then the hong gradually

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:34.100
 dissolves from the bottom up into the top and and then we'll just rest in our awareness

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:39.860
 rest in rikpa you know that's really profound purification

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.100
 okay so now we'll do that

01:20:49.060 --> 01:21:06.740
 above one's head is vatrasatva inseparable from the llama from vatrasatva's body a nectar stream

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:19.300
 descends purifying one's obscurations

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:49.300
 um

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:17.300
 so

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:47.300
 um

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:17.300
 so

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:47.300
 um

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:17.300
 so

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:47.300
 so

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:17.300
 um

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:47.300
 so

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:17.300
 um

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:47.300
 so

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:17.300
 um

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:47.300
 um

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:17.300
 um

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:45.300
 um

01:28:45.300 --> 01:29:05.300
 vatrasatva melts into light and becomes mingled in one taste with one's own perceptions

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:15.300
 so

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:47.300
 so

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:17.300
 so

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:45.300
 so

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:59.300
 go to the guru yoga

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:10.100

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:26.260

 all beings who have been my parents may i accomplish great benefits unobstructedly for

 to all beings who have been my parents may i accomplish great benefits unobstructedly for all

01:39:54.100 --> 01:40:04.180
 beings

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:15.540
 okay just before we seal our practice with our dedication and aspiration prayers

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:23.300
 um and then specifically in relation to the vatrasattva practice i just thought to say a

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:31.460
 couple more things um one is of course while we're reciting the mantra just really resting

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:39.460
 our awareness doing the meditation focusing on each syllable as best we can letting that

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:45.780
 all just reverberate throughout our channels and in our space but then this mantra in particular

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:52.100
 right the mantras are so profound so vast in meaning but there's a beautiful

01:40:52.100 --> 01:41:00.660
 translation or kind of teaching that i think Duryam Rinpoche gave i think that's

01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:03.780
 yeah it's in the back of this book by Venerable Kempos

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:15.700
 and one of the appendices like on page 191 Duryam Rinpoche's explanation of the meaning

01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:22.340
 of the hundred syllable mantra so of course it's part of the meaning connecting with the actual

01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:29.860
 actualizing of our bodhicitta and our vatrasattva is the real meaning and so profound the mantras

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:37.300
 aren't any one but so rich and then in particular the vatra like i mentioned before the vows that

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:44.820
 vatrasattva gave and that connection as vatrasattva being the ultimate power of purification you

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.060
 know

01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:50.980
 on the vajayana level it's also purifying all of our on the bodhicitta level on the pratimoksha

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:58.420
 level on the ordinary level all these are being purified so powerfully and profoundly by these

01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:06.340
 skillful means of putting all these four powers into use and applying the meditation and it's said

01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:12.180
 also in the teachings that like i mentioned as we since we are holding

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:22.340
 at least in our aspiration all the vows of the the nine yanas the vows of the vajayana vows of the

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:29.300
 mahayana vows of the pratimoksha you know and just trying to be good people in the world

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:36.980
 helpful people in the world since we have these but especially since again we're we're purifying

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:44.740
 and we're trying to uphold all what's good and it for everyone everywhere naturally and then

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:44.980
 through

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:51.140
 the great supports and skillful means of the vows and samayas and the teachings that we hold and

01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:58.820
 that we truly aspire to realize and recognize for the benefit of all beings until we don't truly

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:07.700
 have that realization we're always that means we have obscurations right and so always purifying

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:15.150
 is good and so as holders of the secret vajrayana which naturally embodies all the all the

01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:16.180
 teachings

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:23.940
 and practices of the buddha it said if in the teachings if we can do vajrasattva practice daily

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:31.380
 21 recite the hundred syllable mantra again with all the four powers and the visualization and

01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:40.660
 meditation it really helps keep our clean and we're going to be purifying any mistakes we've made

01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:47.140
 on any level in the day and then it said if we can pure if we can do a whole mala

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:53.700
 concentrating one pointedly uninterruptedly on vajrasattva reciting the hundred syllable mantra

01:43:53.700 --> 01:44:00.580
 that purifies just countless lifetimes of obscurations and mistakes and then of course

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:06.340
 so that's just as vajrayana practitioners whether we're doing our nundra or completed our nundra

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:12.900
 definitely right vajrasattva is in every practice but just again to keep our connections pure

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:21.940
 with our teacher and the teachings the buddha dharmasanga the gurus devas dakinis and dharmapalas

01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:27.380
 doing the vajrasattva practice each day is just really encouraged at least

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:34.660
 21 times then of course when we're doing our vad our nundra accumulations we actually accumulate

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:41.140
 hundred thousand and then we just keep going keep going keep going until we're fully enlightened so

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:46.900
 for the benefit of all so i just thought to add those few extra thoughts and now we'll

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:53.940
 dedicate the merit of our practice and make our vast aspiration prayers and then having done that

01:44:53.940 --> 01:45:01.780
 will go up and with the worlds to the best of our abilities with our mindfulness alertness

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:09.620
 conscientiousness keeping our view our meditation and very careful with our conduct according to

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:19.220
 our current capacities okay so we'll start on page 29 in our treasury of mantras and prayers

01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:25.060
 long life prayers for our teachers and then we'll go on with our dedication and aspiration prayers

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:42.260
 26

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:20.340
 by this merit may all obtain

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:27.220
 omniscience may it defeat the enemy wrongdoing from the stormy waves of birth old age sickness

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:34.100
 and death from the ocean of samsara may i free all beings may the soul source of benefit and

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:39.780

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:58.420
 and may our aspirations be achieved the soul remedy for the suffering of sentient beings

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:04.660
 the source of every joy is the teaching may it remain honorably upheld and flourish for a long

 time may all the numberless beings who are sick be quickly freed from sickness may all the afflict

 reach fruition at this very moment for the peoples and nations of the earth may not even the names

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:37.940

 increase and may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise the precious bodhicitta in those
