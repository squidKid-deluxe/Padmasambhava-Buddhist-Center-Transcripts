00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 In according to Vedayana teaching, Buddha has a higher teaching. Higher teaching is that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.400
 enlightenment is not coming from anywhere else.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 Enlightenment is to discover, have to discover. So, enlightenment is. So, our mind is enlightenment

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.000
.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:37.120
 And therefore, then it is also usage of the mind, the usages, such as the poem, song, and the space

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.000
 are also enlightened.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.020
 That's in the teaching. So, everything is in enlightenment. So, therefore, here, what He said, said

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.000
 that this, this, the appearance and the sound and awareness,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 awareness is all really enlightenment. All poems are enlightenment, enlightened.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 All the poems are, what are the poems? Poems are such as the five elements.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 Of course, the space is the best of nature, the power element, but the earth element, power element

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.000
, water element, wind element.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.570
 And this power element is very best, is in the space or the sky element. So, those are obtained in

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.000
 the Buddha teaching, said the power elements.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.620
 And they are already enlightened statements. What they are in the teaching said, they are the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.000
 nature of the poem is emptiness.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.400
 Nature of this, the fire is the emptiness. Nature of the wind is the emptiness and as well as water

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.000
.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.400
 And then, then the space is the emptiness. And that emptiness is really the nature of all this poor

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
 fire, water, wind, earth.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And so, therefore, nature is already enlightened, openness, status.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.020
 And then, that is more deeper level. And then, what Buddha told in the teaching, always on the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.000
 teaching said,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.440
 Buddha nature or tatanga dangarva, all such as emptiness, all this is also no other than really,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.000
 actually, like, everything is enlightened.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.970
 That Buddha nature is reflected in a different way. So, then is all appearance, all these forms are

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.000
 arising.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So, then, in the teaching, the sky is the element, the earth, the male, female Buddha.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 And then, all the forms are the male Buddha's appearance.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And this male and female is also not just like, kind of like the gender thing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 But the openness aspect of nature is the female qualities.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And as well as the appearance aspect of that is the male qualities.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.890
 So, the five elements are the female Buddha's. And then, from the five elements, what is arising is

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.000
 the five aggregates arising.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And that five aggregates are then the poem aggregates, and as well as the feeling aggregates.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And then, perception aggregates, mental formation aggregates, and consciousness aggregates.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.970
 So, those all are also five Buddha's, those are five dhyana Buddha's, male Buddha's, five female

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.000
 Buddha's.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So, therefore, all the appearance, what we see through our eyesight is the all Buddha.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 And then, all the song systems are the voice of these Buddha's.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.260
 And that means song system, every song system is the song of the, where there is a connecting with

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.000
 the elements,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.130
 of five elements, or with the poem, and it is the really voice of those five elements and five

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.000
 poems.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So, therefore, it is like a whole mantra, or the secret song.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And then, our thought and mind is, there is no exactly any kind of existing, solid existing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It's totally open and vastness, infinite qualities.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And that is known as the dharmakaya or the primordial wisdom state.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.930
 So, therefore, everything is enlightened state. That is really the reality, nature, of the way

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.000
 things are.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And then, through that, we've activated that to a visualization meditation.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So, when we visualize the DD, for example, the Vedic life practices.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 The Vedic life is, all the homes are the Vedic life displays.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.500
 And all the song systems of the universe is mantra of the Vedic alliance, not just on Vedic

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.000
 alliance,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 but all the song systems, it really is a secret voice of the Vedic alliance.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And the space in our own mind is that, then, the wisdom mind of the Vedic alliance.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And the reality, again, those three are, when we see those three different ways,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 but all that is within the same state.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And that's why it's remaining inseparably from the innermost, the one test, everyone's wisdom mind.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 So, where there remains all that in one single state is, that's the, is our, within our mind.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 When you look at our mind, we see all those three different things, but it is all in that state.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.270
 So, it's really the, this is the ordinary display or a lively display from the awareness of our own

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.000
 mind.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And then it emerges back to that nature status.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 When we have that realization, and then that is known as a very good realization.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And this is the wishing and the praying, the may I, where may we get this realization.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And this phrase is also very told by very famous human.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.370
 Okay, came in the 16th century, maybe 16th or 7th century, is the same time with the people of

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.000
 Dalai Lama.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:24.620
 And just before he is going to enter Mahaparin nirvana, he joined this, this, and then he entered

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.000
 Mahaparin nirvana.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And this is what we call the last testimony of the display theater.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It's a very popular practice of the human.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Okay, thank you.
