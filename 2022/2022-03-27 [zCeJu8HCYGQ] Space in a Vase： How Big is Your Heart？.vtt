Patterns you freely choose. Your own choices.\n\nIn other words, how much elegance and delight do you allow to shine through yourself?\n\nThrough your limits? The places you\u2019re stuck? The wounds you\u2019re tending to? The affordances you offer others\u2014simply, naturally, without a second thought?\n\nHow much do you include others? Take their perspective? Yet without sacrificing your own?\n\nHow spacious and flexible are you, coupled with discernment and care-full, kind attention?\n\nThese are questions we explore in this teaching.\n\n-\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\n\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 Welcome, friends. Thank you. Good to be here once again. Thank you. Again, we have the amazing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 good fortune to come together in person or at a distance to contemplate and to apply

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 the precious Buddha Dharma in our lives right now, this very moment, and to just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.120
 enjoy it and savor it. So we have this opportunity once more. So wow, such a big

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:45.200
 special thing. I'll just connect to that with really heartfelt gratitude and that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.800
 sense of "Wow, what a precious, rare, special jewel or treasure I have in my

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.440
 hands right now." So we're trying to activate that. It's joy and appreciation. And then at the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 same time, like, wow, to extend that. Oh, may everyone, every single being, be

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.640
 surrounded by nourishing circumstances that uplift them and have them be

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 completely connected, empowered, authentic, grounded, in touch with their own Buddha

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.400
 nature, the own preciousness that they have inside, and the preciousness that's

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.240
 all around us. So this bodhicitta, this awakenness, turn on, open, illuminate this

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 heart mind of enlightenment that we all have, this bodhicitta, great compassion

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.080
 that's the root of all Dharma. So we shine that on. And then thirdly, the pure

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.760
 perception, this devotion in Bhakriyana, kind of really to let ourselves believe,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.280
 like, and if we're really kind of brave and courageous, like to just confidently

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.040
 proclaim the true nature as it is, it's just, it's perfect. It's here, it's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.480
 happening, unobstructed, unstoppable, just is the nature that courses through and

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.000
 through of everything and just confidently, like, kind of rest in that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.400
 courageous view. So we bring those three together, renunciation, bodhicitta, pure

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.960
 perception, kind of seamlessly ignite them now.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 So these three, they really touch to the heart. It's like the heart drop, the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.440
 essence of the Buddha Dharma, renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.120
 perception. So always trying to turn our mind to that again and again, not just to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.280
 see it clearly, but to actually kind of turn, make it, you know, be alive in our

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:24.120
 lived experience right now, pure perception, bodhicitta, renunciation. That's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.120
 the practice, to have that be an ongoing lived experience. So that's kind of our,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.760
 the practice and also the challenge, that's kind of what we keep trying to do

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.440
 as followers of the Buddhist Acumuni and Guru Padmasambhava. So then in

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.840
 particular, because those three qualities can activate and express and so many

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.880
 varieties of ways, then we have to kind of like, somewhere locate a topic of this

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.480
 time together. And so where this is located is, I was on an exercise bike in

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 the morning, thinking, what about the upcoming nundra? And I popped in my head,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.240
 space in a vase. So who knows, that's probably just habitual bhakta popping.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.600
 But so that's kind of, I said, okay, I'm good with that. That's a something I can

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.640
 like, have a little fun with. It's very deep, potentially deep, space in a vase. So

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.800
 that's the topic today for this, and then we'll go into our usual Dijum Tersar

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.920
 practice. So space in a vase. So the idea that I'm kind of like, this is more like

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.840
 a poetic kind of like, let's kind of like artistically play with this idea. But in

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.200
 the context of the Buddha Dharma. So space in the vase. There's, we all have a vase.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.220
 This me, this is my body, my things, my memories, my emotions, my thoughts, my

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.720
 experiences, my history, my trauma, my projections, my talents, my amazing

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.600
 things. This sense of me, there's a someone in here doing, as a kind of like

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.320
 operating the machine. There's something in happening. It seems to be happening.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:20.480
 And it seems to be in. And then there's this whole area called the world or

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.840
 environment, or this room. This seeming outside. It really seems to be there.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.200
 There's a me in here, and there's a not me out there. And that means there's a

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:44.480
 border. Me, the not me. So this topic kind of how I'm orienting around it is, what's

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:53.200
 this inside? What's inside the vase? The border is where I define the me. My

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:02.120
 things. Where I stop and you start. Where I am and then the world happens that I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.440
 get to be within. Right? Samsara out there and then a sentient being in here.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.920
 Container and contained. This is a very traditional way of talking about this in

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.640
 Buddha Dharma. So the way I'd like to kind of open this today, that sense of

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.520
 inside. In Buddhism there's two ways that can be. The space in the vase. The me in

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.840
 here. The inside and then the outside. There's kind of two general ways of

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.200
 defining this inside. What's going on? This interior felt experience. And these

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.360
 two general ways are ego clinging, habitual me. And the other way is Buddha

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:55.600
 nature. Pervasive, profound, perfect, blazingly brilliant Buddha nature. So

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:06.120
 there's the small me. And then there's the nature of that small me. These two

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.480
 ways. In Sutra Mahayana there's so many teachings on this topic. And so another

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.120
 way to frame this is, how can I both be a human being and also have enlightened

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:31.520
 nature at the same time? How can I be me? And also continue along a path of

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.960
 enlightenment that dissolves the egoic fixation. How can I be me and at the same

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:45.160
 time dissolve me? How can I let myself show up as a Drakpa? And I can like

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.880
 scratch my head and I can like have worries and concerns and I can be hungry

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.960
 and I can have things I'm scared of and things I love and savor. All the kind of

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.480
 weird little shadowy areas I avoid and unconscious habitual bhakta patterns.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.280
 All the habitual patterns. I don't even know are there but they're happening. So

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:20.480
 that part, that me, that embedded me, the self, me, the inside, that same me that I

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.920
 felt was here yesterday and the one I felt was here last year. And 20 years

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.560
 ago that ongoing continuous me. In Sutra Mahayana they locate it as being a sense

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.880
 of me that's at the center of everything that's continuous and ongoing and is

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:43.440
 more important than all the other things. That's the definition of a sentient being.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:55.680
 The me in here. Set sense of self that continues through time. That's the center

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.400
 of the universe basically. It's more important than all the other means. So

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 that's one inside. And I think we kind of know a lot about that one. I definitely

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:19.960
 do. It's the cause of all my tears. All the things that don't work. So this is

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:28.520
 the question here. Why doesn't it work? And the answer really is in Sutra Mahayana

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.720
 is that me doesn't see its own nature. It's Buddha nature. It doesn't see its

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:43.280
 own spaciousness. So we'll take a step back. The sense of me, this small little

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.600
 me that showed up 41 years ago, or the sense of you with your history and your

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.760
 language and your gender and you're all the ways we identify and locate me. Right?

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:04.680
 That human me. It's not bad. It's just how I do it. How you do it, you know, seems to

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:11.320
 be continuing. Sutra Mahayana says actually this this sense of me has three

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:18.360
 qualities. If we really look at the nature of this me, these three qualities

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:28.080
 are it's seen as a substance, it's seen as a quality, and then there's a way of

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.720
 seeing. This is Douglas Duckworth, scholar practitioner, Tibetan Buddhist. He

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.520
 defines these distinguishes these really clearly according to the Jangang

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.640
 Mipham Rinpoche. How's the Buddha nature taught about as a substance? Well, it's the

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.760
 Buddha nature, the nature of Buddha. It's a nature. It's an essence, an is-ness, a

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:58.680
 being-ness, a such-ness. It's thought of as a ground, the ground of being, ground

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.760
 path fruition, the ground. If I look closely at my ego clinging, eventually I

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.840
 come to see its nature. It's thought of as a substance. The second thing is

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.920
 quality. Buddha nature is a quality. What's the essential quality of Buddha

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:28.240
 nature? It's completely without any stuck, any sticking point. It is frame free. It

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:38.040
 has no fixed vase. It is utterly flexible, pervasive, unobstructed. It is like space.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.040
 Has the quality of being like space called emptiness. Emptiness, right? Thought

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.680
 of as it talked about as a substance, the is-ness. But when you actually go in your

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.880
 experience, what is it like? Flexible, open, unobstructed, not walled, not contained.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:03.160
 It's the malleability, the freedom of that nature, the groundlessness of the

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.000
 ground. Then the third quality, and Venerable Kemperomache's talk about this

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.240
 in their Shirdra book, Rongtong Shentong. In this book, where they're talking a lot

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.480
 about Buddha nature in this book, they define two types of two ways that Buddha

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.400
 nature is generally talked about. These two ways are talked about as originally

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:31.360
 inherent Buddha nature. This is talked about as space. It's pervasive emptiness

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:39.560
 quality. And then the second way is developed Buddha nature as something we

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:49.480
 actually develop, like a substance growing, right? So this is called clarity

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.240
 in the Tantras. The emptiness, openness, nature, and the clarity arising

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:04.400
 expression, unstoppable, powerful, active energy of that openness, the knowing

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.120
 quality of mind, clarity. And here Kemperomache's talk about these two. We

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:17.280
 only clearly discern these two, both the emptiness nature and the clarity energy

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:27.560
 expression. When we see them as a union, the nature is both open and arising. It's

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.520
 a space within a vase.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:48.120
 Emptiness, nature, constantly unfolding, expressing, connecting, arising, dissolving.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.840
 So these are talked about as the three kayas, the emptiness open, dharmakaya

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.720
 quality, and then the form kaya, sambhoga kaya and Ramana kaya, this

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.400
 expressive quality. So this union of emptiness and clarity, or of the three

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.400
 kayas, the rupakaya and a rupakaya, all together they say that is what the Buddha

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.600
 nature is like. And when we see that as an inseparable union, that is called a

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:22.360
 rigpa, or that is called middle way view. It's called a way of seeing, it's being, a

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.960
 way of being that's unobstructed, that's intelligent, it's called a knowing quality

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:35.040
 of Buddha nature, the enlightened, enlightened, self-knowing, Rangric. So

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.920
 these three qualities, this self-knowing nature, that sees the container, it sees

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.660
 the expression, it sees the outreaching limp, like kind of energy, sees the

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.940
 borders, the boundaries, the qualities, the colors, the shapes, the sizes, the

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.680
 movements, it sees that, and at the same time simultaneously sees, it's just

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.280
 illusory. It's just like a dream.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:10.880
 Whenever me, Drakpami, or whoever you are, whatever your name is, your sizes, your

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.080
 location is, your languages, your ages, all those things, whenever that sense of me

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.280
 looks at itself and activates those qualities, if it's flexible openness, it's

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.960
 connective energetic responsiveness, just naturally moving between boundaries,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:39.560
 extending itself, caring for itself, then we can define what a healthy sense of me,

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:46.120
 this me inside, or an unhealthy sense of me. Unhealthy sense of me is always

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:53.200
 fighting something. Puts its wall and keeps everything out. It's really

00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.160
 selective what it lets in, according to very strict rules about what it wants,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.400
 that can be healthy or unhealthy, but really a healthy sense of me when it

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.600
 connects to its own Buddha nature qualities, it allows itself to be

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:18.840
 intelligently permeable with discerning clarity, it flows with life, it connects

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:25.760
 with things dependently arising because it's interdependent, it has a boundary, it

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:32.280
 has an identity, but it's allowed to be shaped and to shape what's happening

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:41.200
 inside of it and outside of it, it's fluidly flexibly in communication. So I

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.680
 can be a human being and also have an enlightened nature, we can have a

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:58.560
 favorite ice cream flavor and still have an enlightened nature, we really shouldn't

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.060
 see these two as being at odds or fighting each other, like to be an

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.560
 enlightened being means you erase all of your all of the ways we express,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.000
 enlightened being like can express infinitely, that's why they say a Buddha

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.560
 Shakimuni, that's when Rinpoche, Kambharimoche, they'll say oh it was Buddha, oh or you

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.800
 could see it as Samantabhadra, Samantabhadri, or you could see it as

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:29.080
 Vajradhara or as Vajrasattva, whichever way, all the tantras are flexible on that

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:36.740
 because it can be steam or it can be ice or it can be water. For beings that can

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.840
 flex flow in and out, what's helpful? It allows for the nature to

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.880
 flex because the nature does flex, so it doesn't say I'm not gonna flex anymore

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:53.520
 in here, that's when we get a brittle sense of me that's always trying to

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.760
 defend itself because it's done an unhealthy unnatural move and locked

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.740
 itself in a cage and now is trying to make the world fit in its cage and it's

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:16.360
 doomed, the world is not gonna squeeze inside my vase, the vase will shatter. So

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.080
 how can I have this expressive quality that's actually healthy? It discerns what

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.960
 to let in, what to not let in, how to flex, how to flow. So first I want to

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:34.000
 emphasize being a human is okay before that, how to become like a

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.080
 Bodhisattva. Trung Purimpoche, Trung Purimpoche said in his collective works

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:47.480
 volume 9. Don't be afraid of who you are. The key to warriorship and the ultimate

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.120
 definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are. Examine your

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.560
 experience to see what it contains that is of value in helping yourself and

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:05.280
 others. Warriorship is the opposite of selfishness. We become selfish when we

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.720
 are afraid of ourselves and afraid of the seeming threats the world presents. We

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.920
 want to build a little nest, a cocoon to protect ourselves but we can be much

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.320
 braver than that. Even in the face of great problems we can be heroic and kind

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:36.400
 at the same time. So how do we discern when is this small me connecting to its

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.240
 vast infinite spacious quality of Buddha nature? When is it connecting? When is it

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:52.760
 healthy? When is that interior spaciousness? Like intelligently like

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.760
 flexing with its boundaries and what it can it's a clear no in a celebratory yes

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:08.040
 and when it can really honor itself and honor others too. How do we discern that?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:16.720
 Because the first thing is we have to love ourselves, right? Self-compassion

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.840
 it's called renunciation. We renounce what's bad for me, the causes of suffering.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.640
 I have to love myself that much to renounce all the ways I hurt and all the

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.200
 causes of my suffering. I care about myself that much so I want to renounce

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:40.240
 that because I want to be happy. So why? Then it will naturally extend the vase

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.960
 extends the boundary extends it includes more because you want to be happy because

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:54.640
 you don't want to suffer. So how do we expand our boundary to include more

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:06.340
 space? Then his only 17th karmapa, Ojintin Lidorje, he said in his book the

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:14.440
 heart is noble. This is such a treasure trove of so much precious advice. This is

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.180
 a sense giving a sense of the difference of when we're like holding ourselves in

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:24.000
 a way that's against other things versus when we're holding ourselves in a way

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.760
 that embraces other things. So when is our vase a wall that keeps everything

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:38.760
 out with weapons pointed out and when is our our boundary like actually like

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:46.920
 invitation to mingle to learn more to be curious to flex flow with all the things

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:54.880
 happening around us to be interdependent. So his only 17th karmapa he says when we

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.440
 gaze out through our own window of grasping at me and mine we experience

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.080
 everything as if it were being projected onto our personal frame of perception

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.440
 like a movie projected onto a screen. Just as when we're watching a movie if

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.480
 we observe a happy moment our heart soars and if there's a sad moment we at

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:22.560
 once feel low. This grasping at me and mine restricts our view of ourselves. It

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.000
 also severely impacts how we connect to others. It prevents us from seeing the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.840
 numberless wholesome connections that truly link us to others. We end up

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.680
 relating to the world as if it were separate from us. Something out there

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.080
 projected on a screen for our consumption. I'm not presenting a

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.240
 philosophical view here. I'm trying to describe what it feels like to

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.720
 experience the world in this way. As we look out through our window we feel

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.800
 attachment and aversion. We accept or reject what we see projected on the

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.680
 screen. This emotional push and pull forms a major component of how we relate

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:13.320
 to others. This is called samsaric attachment. Egoic clinging. As sentient

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.560
 being I'm very really familiar with this. So then he says another way of how to

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.800
 relate to other beings maybe some five pages later. The point I want to make is

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:32.200
 that love can be true and lasting under the right conditions. This is my own

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:39.080
 personal view on this. Love can have this vast all-encompassing quality. It can be

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.960
 allowed to spread until it permeates the very core of our relationships. Yet

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.680
 often instead of giving love room to expand we box it in with our own

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.280
 expectations. Expectations make our love conditional on what the other person

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.180
 does or says. Our concern for the other person also becomes conditional on

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.600
 whether or not the relationship fulfills our wishes. How can you expect love to

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.560
 last when you demand that it meet your conditions and you act as if you're as

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:19.420
 if you own another person. Again how can you expect love to last when you demand

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:25.840
 that it meet your conditions and act as if you own another person. For love to

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.680
 last it is best not to have too many expectations. It is better just to offer

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:40.600
 love. I want to share with you a feeling I have. I feel that my love

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.720
 I want to share with you a feeling I have. I feel that my love does not have to

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:06.080
 remain within the limitations of my own life or body. I imagine that if I'm no

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.160
 longer in the world my love could still be present. I want to place my love on

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.560
 the moon and let the moon hold my love. Let the moon be the keeper of my love

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.580
 offering it to everyone just as the moon sends its light to embrace the whole

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:36.400
 earth. So this is how our sense of me can freely become the biggest attribute we

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.280
 have when it connects to its nature. Like we can have like Trunk Barimba also says

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.560
 it's such a funny thing about my head. Everyone loves something even if it's

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:56.600
 just tortillas. We can have that little spark or we know what that's like and we

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:02.360
 can open that. We all have this space inside. It doesn't have to be a locked

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:11.760
 box. It can be just like just really outpouring and genuinely kind engaged

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:21.360
 kindness and this is just bodhicitta. Wisdom and compassion. The wisdom to know

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.920
 the interdependence. The compassion to want to extend, to want to embrace, to

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.960
 want to include more and to do it carefully according to detail what's

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:40.400
 really helpful right now. That means I have to listen to you. I have to tune in

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:51.480
 to you. Not just what's happening in me but in you. What's happening? And then

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:59.480
 then wow what this is the big miracle then. The space in me is the same as the

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:09.760
 space in you. It's the same. It's the same Buddha nature. When our own ways of

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:17.440
 holding, of expressing, when they actually help realize this is we're the same. This

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:28.880
 nature is the same. Then we're on the path. This is the Bodhisattva path. Then

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.000
 it's not a fight. It's like there's so much energy comes to want to listen to

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.080
 you, pay attention, love, care, learn, see my own shortcomings, see the ways I keep

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.280
 tripping up, getting stuck because I wanted that spaciousness. It just

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:59.520
 include more, include more. It just would just be natural. Our compassion would

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.200
 just naturally come. Chandra Kirti, the great master of Chandra Kirti, he said, "There's

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.600
 four types of compassion." Venerable Kavramicha mentioned this in his

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:15.320
 mountain retreat instructions I think in 2010. PSO. Four types of compassion. One

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.840
 type of compassion is we see something, some suffering. Someone gets hurt. We see

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.760
 it all. We have compassion. There's an object that demonstrates suffering and

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:33.040
 because of that object, oh, we hurt. Oh, ninj, ninj, compassion, compassion. That's

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:39.560
 one type. The second type is we don't see the person suffering. We see the cause of

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:46.760
 the suffering, ignorance. They don't see how beautiful they are. Oh, they don't see

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.160
 that anger is gonna make it worse. Oh, they don't see that attachment is gonna

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.480
 doom to fail. Oh, it's so sad, you know. And we can see that in ourselves too. Oh, I

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.800
 keep doing this. So sad. Oh, but I have this quality. I'm gonna bring this out. I

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.560
 don't have to do this again now. That's what, confession. I was reading so many

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.040
 interesting things. In Tibetan, confession means to separate from. We can see that

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.720
 negative quality, the negative poison of mind, the negative habitual pattern, and

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.360
 we separate from it because I'm Buddha nature. I'm not all this crap. I love

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:27.600
 myself enough to connect to the, really, the nature. So the third type of

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.480
 compassion is object-less, without focus. It's just naturally

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.000
 abrasive, naturally inclusive. Compassion just is as it is. Abide in the ground,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.960
 it's naturally compassionate. It's not because something happened and it said,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:52.360
 oh. It just naturally includes, without limit, all the layers of facing, all the

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.840
 boundaries, and it just keeps going forever because the nature keeps going

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.240
 because expression keeps going. Inside, teeny teeny teeny tiny. Outside, forever.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.080
 There's no final frame. Smallest or biggest? This is really bedrock Buddhism.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:18.280
 Emptiness. There's no final fixed essence, core, entity, identity, totally flexible.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:26.560
 That's compassion without focus, just like space. It's just there. The fourth type

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:33.280
 of compassion is, compassion arising as a deity. Chenrezig, this Tara, as Guru

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:42.120
 Rinpoche, Padmakara. It's full, like, unadulterated, perfectly pure, majestic,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:49.840
 fearless expression of the nature, utter proclamation of the truth. No, no

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.280
 hesitation as Guru Rinpoche arises on the lotus. All the dakinis and dakas, just all

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:01.000
 the, all at once, all together, the seven-line prayer is spontaneously arising.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Fearless proclamation. This is compassion arising as a deity. This is what it's

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 like when we can play within any kind of framing.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.920
 Guru Rinpoche can be a boat, a breeze, a memory, a medicine, just like great

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:30.200
 Shanti Deva said. The flexibility can take any framing, any vasing, and Guru

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:36.040
 Rinpoche just seamlessly gels with what's helpful, and that's how reality is

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.040
 actually unfolding every single moment. This is actually Guru Rinpoche just

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:47.840
 helping us again and again. Why? Because Guru Rinpoche is no different than me and

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:58.400
 you. There's space outside is the same as the space inside. So then we have to

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:05.200
 break the vase. What does this mean? Break the vase. Break the vase means be

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:14.600
 flexible to accommodate whatever's most helpful. It doesn't mean have no vase, no

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:22.080
 expression, no form. It's always emptiness as form and form as emptiness. It's always

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:29.220
 both. It means form according to what's helpful, terraform according to what

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.140
 actually serves beings, and then we tried it again and again. We try to learn how

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.920
 to do that better and better to accommodate more skillfully. That's why

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.960
 all of Adriana's defined as skillful means is the big distinctive feature in

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.160
 addition to Sutra Mahayana. The skillfulness of how we can adapt, how

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.480
 flexibly we can accommodate situations. We can use food as a practice, use sleep

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.640
 as a practice, use this as a practice. It's all Guru Rinpoche. So anything is usable.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:05.360
 It's all the same space. So this becomes infinite vase. That's why they say

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:14.620
 in Sotun single-sphere. No final edge. Contains everything. It's infinite and it

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:22.480
 contains all the vases inside of it which are infinite. So there's no big war.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:31.120
 It's only a question of what really helps right now. That's it. And so I

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.280
 thought or I saw this quote and I wanted to read it because it's always the

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:43.480
 question of once we ring with that, okay this is the path, then it's always how. How

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.100
 do I serve more effectively? And this I think I want to read the whole

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.720
 thing but this is like then I'll conclude with this. This is only the

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.620
 sixteenth karmapa. This is good to have a kagyu, the kagyupas. It's good to have a

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:06.520
 kagyu, really strong kagyu base today. All these lineages and schools are so

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.200
 precious. So this is from his only sixteenth karmapa and it is quoted in the

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:17.600
 book Heart Advice of the Karmapa. And it's called A Reminder to Myself. Again,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.800
 this is a question of how to become more spacious, more discerning, more skillful.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:29.480
 So how do we actually grow this sense of spaciousness and extend our sense of

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:38.760
 vase? How? A reminder to myself, the sixteenth karmapa. With your supreme

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.960
 intelligence, you realize the intention of the unsurpassable vehicle, the

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:48.160
 tradition of Padmakara. Guru of unequaled kindness, I remember you from my heart. I

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.480
 supplicate you, bless me with your compassion. I, Pema Trinley Palsang, a

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.240
 performer of three activities from now on, will take control of my own discipline

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.120
 and thought and deed. I make a firm commitment as follows to avoid

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:10.720
 thoughtlessness and senselessness. In physical conduct, I will not allow myself

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:18.400
 to be rootless and hurried, incapable of being still, carelessly following my every

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.280
 whim. I will always hold my own space and be adorned by the training in pure

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:33.080
 discipline. In speech, whether spiritual or secular, I will choose meaningful words,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:39.920
 in shun unconnected talk of past events or boring discussions concerning any of

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.600
 the three times. I will always exert myself in dharmic recitations,

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.760
 proclamations, and readings. In mind, I will not flutter back and forth like a

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.040
 young bird on a branch. Not getting absorbed in discursive thoughts of good

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.020
 and bad, I will meditate, cultivating forbearance and relying on my own

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:09.140
 perceptions, not those of others. I will reflect on how best to benefit the

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:15.480
 teachings and beings. In particular, the vital essence of the thought of all

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:21.880
 victorious ones is the true nature, the uncontrived innate dharmakaya. Without

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.500
 everlasting, I will sustain it with one taste in equipoise and post meditation.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:32.880
 In sum, I will hold myself to the sublime, dharmic conduct of the three gates, not

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.400
 falling under the influence of others, arrogance, haughtiness, or thoughts of

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.640
 self-aggrandizement. Whatever of these arises, I will not let them move me in

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.840
 the slightest. I will remain firm, dignified, and fearless like a mountain.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.760
 Until this collection of elements has rotted away, I will not waver from this

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.960
 way of being. Of this way, I will be a fearless warrior. That will be my quality.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:07.200
 This is my vow, like an image carved in stone. May it be virtuous. Gods and

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.720
 protectors work to help this come to pass. May the virtuous signs of

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.720
 auspiciousness excellently blaze.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:29.920
 Thank you, friends. All in all, this is like a plea. The world is undergoing so

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:37.440
 much suffering. We all know this. Inside, there's so much suffering. I think we all

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:43.000
 know this, too. Like Trum Perum Pachay said in the early 1980s, when he was first

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:52.800
 presenting Shambhala teachings, the world needs us. The world needs the Dharma. The

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.720
 world needs this kindness and compassion, this wisdom, this groundedness. The world

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:10.480
 needs us. This is not the time to check out. This is the Vajrayana time. In the

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.640
 fortunate, Eon Sutra, the Buddha was so clear on this. This is the time for

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:20.840
 accomplishment and for outreaching activities. This is the time. It's the

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:27.320
 best time. Everything outside is going to disrupt us, disturb us, trigger us,

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:35.120
 activate us. It's going to push against our frame, our vase, really strongly. Then

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.960
 we need to really take on this courageous approach, connect to our own spaciousness,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:47.320
 see that the spaciousness outside is the same. This is an opportunity when that

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.920
 doorbell rings, when that friction happens, when the pushing, when we feel the

00:38:51.920 --> 00:39:00.040
 pushing, inside pushing, outside pushing. This is the opportunity for Vajrayana.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:07.160
 All the Vajrayana teachings are about how to use this opportunity. There's so

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.480
 many teachings on this. The noble ones, the true noble ones, like the Venerable

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.180
 Kemper Rinpoche, this one is Karmapa, this one is Dalai Sallama, this one is

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.480
 Saki Tristan. So many noble ones around, like they all have exact

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.160
 pithy words of advice exactly for these times. It's one click away, but then

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.680
 we have to do it and we have to keep doing it, preserve it, and let it

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.240
 marinate in us, and transform us, and open us, and flex us. We need to take it to

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.800
 heart. So really thankful for the opportunity to be with you all, to be

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.520
 with you all, really very much very thankful. It's like such a fleeting

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:54.160
 moment. We're all gonna be gone so soon, so fleeting. Whenever I have a

00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:02.320
 little whiff of this, like now, on occasion, when dear friends pass, when

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.320
 loved ones pass, then on occasion I wake up. Oh man, this is really true, impermanence

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.120
 is really true. Really take this to heart. This Vajrayana time,

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:18.000
 time to fearlessly kind of be like a lion, be like a mountain, like have the

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.200
 energy, the arising push and pull of samsara, spark on a courageous view, open,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:35.600
 flexible, spacious nature, and this is kind of my own wish, and like really thank

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.720
 you all. We keep trying, we keep going, never give up. As this always Dalai Lama

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:48.600
 says, never give up. Thank you friends. Thank you. Thank you.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:02.480
 So I thought to just kind of finally complete that space and a base, space and a

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:10.120
 base idea, is that I didn't say so much, but the base itself, the holding, the way

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:17.160
 we hold space for ourselves, and the way we hold space for others. There's so many

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.280
 ways to do that that's really healthy, and it's really finally and accurately

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:32.240
 attuned to situations. So there's so many ways we can hold that, and I think

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.720
 partly like whatever vase we have, whatever way of making sense, of framing

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.480
 things, of like whatever our kind of zone that we kind of like are typically in,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.600
 that that's, it's fine, because we can't get good at all the zones. Like there's

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:58.040
 the rich wealth in every single arena, or every, every ecosystem, every way of kind

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.160
 of holding as like infinite variety of diversity and complexity, and like so much

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.880
 beauty. So the big mistake to avoid that like really disconnects us from our Buddha

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:17.000
 nature, is when we think my way of holding is the way everything has to be

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.520
 held. That's the kind of fundamental mistake, and it really closes us off to

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.000
 the Buddha nature and ourselves and others, because we're more rich than that,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.800
 we're more amazing than that, and others are too. But the final thing I thought,

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.400
 when we forget that, which I do all the time, is the infinite history of forgetting

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.680
 that, not being connected to Buddha nature, forgetting Buddha nature outside,

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.000
 then I came across this brief statement, a secular statement on the

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.360
 podcast On Being with Christa Tippett, and it really struck me, and it's like not

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.960
 even like necessarily Dharma thing, but just if we've made mistakes from all the

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.720
 time, we like misstepped, we like took our thing and pushed it on someone else, we

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.440
 took our base, our way of holding, and we assumed everyone else needed to do the

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.040
 same thing. Then this particular four lines were really helpful for me, it's

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.960
 like I immediately wrote them down, and they're like four lines to say like

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:26.360
 before you die. Four lines to say before you die. Thank you. I love you. I forgive

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:36.960
 you. Can you forgive me? Then we can really connect to Buddha nature and

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:43.600
 ourselves. If we have that bravery, that vulnerability, thank you. I love you. I

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.480
 forgive you. Can you forgive me? We've all made mistakes, we've forgotten our Buddha

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:54.280
 nature, and we haven't seen it in others. This simple secular way of just

00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:00.320
 reorienting, we can really reset everything, then we can really open up

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:07.120
 and reconnect to this beauty, beautiful spaciousness outside and inside.
