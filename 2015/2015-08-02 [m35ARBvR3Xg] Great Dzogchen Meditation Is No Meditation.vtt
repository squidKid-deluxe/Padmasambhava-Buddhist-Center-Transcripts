00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760
 When you see the nature of the Rupa, Rupa and also same time, the errors and mistakes of the dual

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.000
ities.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.160
 You see, at that moment, if you are relaxing in the natural state without any publication or

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000
 without any constructive things,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 and that is known as meditation. Meditation, when you are not distracted residing in that status,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 that is known as meditation or keeping up the meditation, there is no meditation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 The "Great Meditation" in Dzogchen teaching often uses it. "Great Meditation" is no meditation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.850
 What that means is Dzogchen meditation has no effort. You are not making any effort and making

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000
 around this, about that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Everything is in the natural status. There is nothing in really anything and it is not natural.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 When you have that understanding and relax under this natural status and that present status,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 that present status and that openness and clear status, that is natural.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 What we need now for the particular big in the practice, in the evening and the advanced practice

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 in the teaching

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 is to bring the strength of the mindfulness, awareness, not let it be distracted.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.230
 Not let it be distracted. By what? By the object of six senses. Don't let it be diluted and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.000
 distracted by the object of six senses.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 All the six senses and just let it go. In order to do this, again not let it be distracted by the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.000
 six senses,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 what in the teaching said? As I said the other day, now go young.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.760
 That means relax in the natural status without any publications and let it come, let it go and no

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.000
 judgmentals.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.310
 And for that what in the teaching said? I use the example, I mean not just me. This is a very known

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.000
 teaching.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.750
 And as baby watch, baby see the neuropandons, neuropandons of the world, what that baby makes

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 judgmental.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.140
 All many times also said grown up purpose, grown up purpose watch the sand castles of the children

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.000
's play.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 When the children's play in the sand castles in the beach, grandparents when they watch that, watch

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.000
 all parents watch that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.140
 What they are going to do that with? They see these sand castles, they are doing these things but

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.000
 they are not going to make big judgment or judgment that.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Even maybe children's make a big judgment in big things but they just say it's sand castles.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.950
 And the children say that's the training department. The other father says yes, yes, that is the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.000
 training department.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And they say this is my garage. Yes, this is your garage.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 You are the children's. All grandparents say that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Or this is my bedroom. They say yes, your bedroom. How beautiful this is.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.530
 Even though that baby, even though grandparents say this, what they have, they don't have big

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.000
 cleaning yard.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 That's the how. It's called see where things are. See as it is.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And without judgmentalness. We were able to do that.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.450
 That is known as then not described by external object or the six senses of the object and the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.000
 subject.
