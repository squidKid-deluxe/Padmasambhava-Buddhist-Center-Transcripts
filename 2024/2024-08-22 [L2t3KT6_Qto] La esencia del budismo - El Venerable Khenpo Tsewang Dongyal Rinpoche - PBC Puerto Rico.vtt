00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 And now I talk a little bit about the Dharma, and of course you all know.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:14.600
 You all know because you already get, you already presume.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:27.600
 So it's not something new, I have to say, I just will say what I used to say and again.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:38.400
 And now, again, I will say Dharma practice is really a belief in atrocity, and that's my belief.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 It's one of the best things we can do while we are in life in the Rinpoque world.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 I'm not just talking, kind of saying that, but really I believe that in my heart,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 in the samsara, in all, there are 300 major things in the samsara.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 One thing is more outwardly activity that we do, and one thing is more connect with the heart.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:34.660
 Most of the time we in the samsara or in this world are carried by the force of what things need to

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.000
 do externally.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And that all activity has also involved the same thing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 It involves the mental activity, physical activity, verbal activities.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 So most of the time people, or even the animals, are spending time to do in the world externally,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 to try to do, and spending all the efforts of the mental, physical, verbal, to complete something

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 for this life.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It's important for all the people who are in the world, to have the same activity,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 and to have the same experience as the rest of the world.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It's important for all the mental, physical, verbal activities to complete something.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 It really is very important.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 It's a very important, surviving purpose.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 But that is on the kind of wider way of thinking, looking from the wider point of view.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 It's a very short time.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 What means short time?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Short time of our life spans.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 What if life spans we have 80 years, 70 years, 60 years, 40 years, 30, or 20 years?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.090
 And even then, during that purpose we're trying to follow something is a component to our

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000
 physically, mentally,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 and globally for that purpose, we're spending almost our 80% all effort for that purpose.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And many times we achieve the purpose of what we really would like to do in that life sometimes.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.050
 But always, strongly, there's never always completely satisfaction, or is that happened in our

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:07.000
 country?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 You really know it, even in football, still it has need more to do it, it is continually stronger.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 You will see those all activities more related with external.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And then more inwardly related is how they connect with our own heart and mind.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.470
 And then there's a difference, but I think you often mentioned that we're more connected to our

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.000
 heart and natural quality with our mind.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 We're trying to do something with that, that is more rewarding and is more satisfaction, passion,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.200
 and that trend, you know, what we will be able to develop, we will have more joy, more richness in

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.000
 this life,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.630
 but not just only that, also that will really become a big comfort for where we live, define this

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.000
 world.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.280
 And then in Buddhism, we believe next life, so there it will be very beautiful comfort for the next

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.000
 life.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.520
 So this, that what we do love really inwardly, that is really so rewarding, so stable, is

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.000
 continually giving the peace, the happy and the satisfactions.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 So, this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to do it.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to do it.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.330
 And this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.000
 do it.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.310
 And this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.000
 do it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 And this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to do it, and this is the best way to

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 do it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.880
 And that is simple and general, clearly to say, it is really the practicing the Dharma, that

00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:10.000
 because this Dharma practices our heart, and the quality of the name, our own nature of the mind.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.440
 And that is, then, in our own practicing lineage, generally, every practice lineage is open and

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:30.000
 says, you should have always three frames.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.400
 And that is, then, and I also had an opportunity to mention that three times, and now I'm going to

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.000
 say again that one more time.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And those are simple, just beginning novel, middle novel, and ending novel.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And what is that novel is? Novel is not any saying outside, one's own nature of the mind.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 What is that big novel is? Novel is joy, love, kindness, and compassion, and appreciation.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:53.410
 And those all are beginning novel. And now I'm making many names, and one of those, you're trying

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.000
 to summarize that, what is that?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Can you summarize that whole one I said is bodhicitta. What is bodhicitta?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:27.730
 Bodhicitta is love and kindness and compassion. And then, in the bodhicitta image, what is love and

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.000
 kindness and compassion, and we can summarize that, what is that?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:41.230
 That's we can conclude it to the compassion. And what is that compassion is? In the normal samsara

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.000
 in the world called good heart.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 So good heart isn't the novel. And what that is, what that is, is compassion.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Compassion to who? To one's own self, as well as all the living beings.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And we expanded that compassion, one in the bodhicitta, whole in regular level.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:34.080
 Whole in regular level, we summarized that with good heart, but we extended that whole in regular

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.000
 level.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:48.470
 And that whole in regular level, as many of you already know, love, compassion, joy, or reduce, and

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.000
 then equanimity.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Why become in regular? Because this is bodhicitta. Bodhicitta means thinking of all living beings.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.820
 Not just the human being, that's also animal. Not just only the human being, the animal, but there

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.000
 is also many individual beings.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Every living being that moves and that has feeling.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And that whole, our love, compassion, is prevailing to all those living beings.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.050
 So we can really sense it from the deepest of our heart, really we, and that is what in our

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.000
 practice, the Buddha started this morning, we did practice.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 That may all living beings have happiness.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 We can sense it from our heart, all living beings we said.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Not just said only the human beings, or only our neighbors, or only our family, or only me.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 We said all living beings, so have happiness, and the cause of happiness.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 What is the cause of happiness? Cause of happiness is love. Cause of happiness is compassion.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 The true compassion and true love are the cause of happiness, and peace, and harmonious.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Then we did pray, may all living beings have the premium sufferings.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:17.550
 And cause of sufferings. And what is the cause of suffering? Anger, attachment, agressive, and

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.000
 ignorance.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:29.150
 Those are the cause of suffering. And so we mentioned that they all suffer, whatever they

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.000
 experience currently, but also cause of that to every living being.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:43.770
 So that means with that anger and ignorance and agressive bond, what will come? Joy, peace,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:49.000
 happiness, apprehension, respect, and politeness, kindness.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.530
 All those we call so good. Why? Because it's so pure, so special, reflecting from heart, not just

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.000
 from the emotional levels.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 This is something we have been talking about for a long time.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 It's something we have been talking about for a long time.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And those are the cause of suffering.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And this is something we have been talking about for a long time.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And this is something we have been talking about for a long time.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And this is something we have been talking about for a long time.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 So those are like big innovators.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:40.570
 And so that means when we start to practice, when we are not practicing, when we are old, even when

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.000
 we think about it, even for five seconds,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.980
 or maybe one minute, we really think sincerely, we are all living with happiness, the cause of

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.000
 happiness.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 May every living be the principle of suffering, the cause of suffering.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.780
 Genuinely thinking for one second or one minute in the busy mode of the speech, or in the helping

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.000
 mode, or in some busy topic place.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And we think that that is terrific, is super practical. It is really so powerful.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And I think that all of us need to understand the cause of suffering, the cause of suffering, and

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 the cause of suffering.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.440
 It is something we have been talking about for a long time, and it is something we have been

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.000
 talking about for a long time.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.990
 And we have been talking about it for a long time, and it is something we have been talking about

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.000
 for a long time.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.940
 And it is something we have been talking about for a long time, and it is something we have been

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.000
 talking about for a long time.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.130
 And generally, of course, also in the Buddha teaching, you have already mentioned how important

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.000
 conduct is.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.940
 Conduct means activities of how we activate our mentally, physically, verbally. That is the three

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.000
 things we have.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.110
 So if we can always observe our own self, our way of our attitude, way of the pronunciation of

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.000
 saying, communicating with others,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.880
 way of physical activity, kind of guided with mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness, really it

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.000
 will become so gentle and peaceful and meaningful, our actions.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.350
 So therefore, it is also, along with the body and the throat, there are all the activities trying

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.000
 to give more kind of politeness, kindness, compassion, respectful,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.400
 more kind of low-ended looking, low-ended speaking, low-ended respectfully communicating with other

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.000
 Sangha members or with other families.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.110
 But that bodhicata is not just only certain groups. Bodhicata is to our self. Bodhicata is to

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:11.000
 everyone, to the family, to the friends, to the Sangha members, to all.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.550
 And we keep that. That means we are keeping the practice perfectly and beautifully. We are really

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.000
 advancing to the path and boomis in the taking of prevention.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 So therefore, this polite and the kind and the compassion, kind of more humble and more simple,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.180
 beyond the art, being more practical, our own self, being to ourselves as teachers and instructors,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.000
 to ourselves is really excellent.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.720
 And that is all our reach. You should try to do that, and I should try to do that. It's not just

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.000
 that somebody said that and then somebody had to act.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.190
 This is all our, how to break the teacher Buddha Chhachaman himself when you read the life story of

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.000
 all that.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 How kind, how impatient, how thoughtful, how humble, how simple, how down to the earth Buddha.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Buddha is the highest teacher in the Buddhist. There's nothing higher and better than that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.700
 You cannot see the teaching of suttas and how really Buddha is always communicated. Even Buddha

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.000
 knows everything.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.290
 Buddha asks to the student, "What do you think?" and then says, "Yes, teacher, that's true or not

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.000
 true?"

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Always dialogue and that is not that the Buddha don't know. Buddha knows.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.420
 But even that, because of the politeness, the kindness, how that is really is so, I mean those are

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.000
 the example points.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.130
 So trying to polite is so important, and the great master Shanti Deva said too, when you look to

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.000
 the people, look to the kind in comparison.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.650
 And when you ask them something, answer very politely with gesture of respect. And those are body

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.000
 activities, those are our practices.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 So those are all normal activities. We never maintain that we feel happy and joy in the life.
