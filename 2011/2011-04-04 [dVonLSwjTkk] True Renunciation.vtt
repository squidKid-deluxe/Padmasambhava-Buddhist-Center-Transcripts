 "No second what that means. It will begin renouncing our attachment, clinging. We feel more rich of

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:19.750
 life. When we take this purpose, it brings karma to ourselves, to the center, not only hovering in

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.000
 the sky, or not only looking out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 We are looking inwardly, and we feel richness. We settle ourselves. Our minds become more soft,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.010
 hearts become more soft, gentle, nice. And when that happens, what is it? It's very natural joy,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 peace, happiness, and thoughtful.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 And also, it will bring more friendship. It's not just "I am, I am." It really brings karma. You

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 begin to see every environment, in their own sorrow, what we are, and what we are, ourselves.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 And therefore, in the teaching, always you must think of this. And therefore, for example, this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:08.000
 Buddha praise that we've joined by the great Master, post-Chenze.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 This is his words of also the "Chenze" of Mother. How beautiful! When you start thinking of this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 portrait, seven trainings of the Buddha are beautiful.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 This is our prayer. Prayer is not just designed to say something, but it's practice. That's what we

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.000
 reflect.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.190
 All component things are important, like what about how we put examples. And all this, it's not

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.000
 just kind of saying something, "Mr. Stroll is here."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 It's not really Mr. Stroll's. It's true account, true, negative account.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.690
 To any standard point, if they speak this language, or they speak the same language, same kind of

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.000
 thought in this.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 This is, it's just so, it is beautiful. We need to reflect this thought.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 It brings our scatter of attachment, grasp and scatter of hundreds more, hundreds more. It makes

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 our mind more gentle, more peaceful, more rich, more settled.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.910
 This, therefore, always in the teaching says, reflect this thought before every session of the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.000
 practices.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.510
 And many great masters, such as like those masters, if you don't reflect these thoughts, even the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.000
 person, big enough of yours, even they use the sessions, period, period, the second.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And if you didn't reflect those enough, maybe at the beginning session you are a good practitioner,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 end of the session your mind become more kind of like, more tight.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So, the turn to mind to the download, this is very important. Think of this.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And also to keep continuing download on the smooth ride and progress to reflect, this is very

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 important.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.510
 This is, those are the foundation, not just important, but those are the foundation in a way,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.000
 foundation that we have established.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.600
 And then we don't start, and then, I mean, you know, already now.
