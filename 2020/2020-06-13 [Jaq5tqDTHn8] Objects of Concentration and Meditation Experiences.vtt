00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating and coming again. Thank you very much. Thank you,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 time, and effort, of your effort for the Dharma. Dharma is very happy and grateful. Thank you for

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 these opportunities.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.160
 Again, we're going to touch the best of the basically teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shak

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.580
yamuni. So therefore, again, we should always remember and not forget that our best, important,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.880
 embarrassing and very fundamental, the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.360
 motivations or the fundamental foundation of the Dharma, which is motivations. And again, that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 motivation, this time, your and appreciation, and then body to that for all living beings. And that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.960
 also means that I'm going to really do reflect the teaching and the practices and do the practice

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the six paramata, according my capabilities and the really determination and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.710
 for every reason to benefit for all living beings. Really kind of sincerely having that attitude

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.410
 and thought in mind, which is the body to that, of course, you all know that. With that thought and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:44.900
 then beauty, again, realization of according to the Vedayana teaching that was always said in the

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910
 teaching, thought asking. So therefore, again, having those visual motivations and then we reflect

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.520
 the teaching. And the teaching we follow again is, of course,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.920
 the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni that particularly is pointed out that our greatest, finest

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 teacher, Jyugra Ishidodya or Jyabjaya Dhryunamaji, many of you met of this great master, great

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 teacher and maybe few of you didn't really met that physically. But we all connected to this great

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.340
 master because his great master was really the most powerful or

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 one of the most famous and kind of teachers, so many practitioners, so many great teachers and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 everyone. So therefore, that everyone almost almost become like his students. And therefore, and we

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.000
 all really connected that we are like, maybe second generation from these great masters, or maybe

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720
 the first one, we are really connected at the regulatory physicals.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.990
 But never mind of the physical connection, but we are connected to the spiritual, his voice. The

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.600
 most important is the teaching. And together with the teaching, together with his mind, mind and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.720
 his realization mind and the teaching, that truly we are connected.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.010
 So that we are following this teaching. And this teaching, again, we went quite a while ago and we

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:23.770
 went through one after another and now we are still on the section of the bodhicata in a way, how

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.800
 we really entered with Dharma.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.130
 And the great teacher, Prasad Cakkimani pointed out that suffering truth, the cause of suffering

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.250
 truths, those are the samsaras. But we like to change the samsara, how we do that. And that is non-

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.040
eighth thing, following the path of truth, path of truth will bring the realization.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.650
 To follow the path of truth, that is then, all the Buddhism, first you take rafuddhas. So we went

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.040
 through those old, about rafuddhi-taking rafuddhas.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.220
 Once you talk rafuddhi, they are also called Mahayana teaching, that taking rafuddhi is also not

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.040
 just only for ourselves, because our compassion.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.690
 Our kindness and configuratory for all living beings, we take rafuddhi in the Buddha Dharma Sanghas

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.550
. Once we talk rafuddhi, then we are expanded and more strongly motivated, then we develop the bodh

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.040
icata, mind of the enlightenment.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.040
 Once we develop the bodhicata mind, then the bodhicata can be divided into truths.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.040
 And the activities, the intention of bodhicata, or wishing bodhicata, and actualizing bodhicata.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.040
 Intention of the wishing bodhicata is the first.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 That intention of bodhicata, also we progress, is developed by poor, boundless thought.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040
 Poor, boundless thought.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.600
 When poor, boundless thoughts are become stronger and deeper, and sitting in our heart, we apply

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.040
 that with the tungmi practices.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:13.810
 The tungmi, or the dagi nyamba, the tungmi practices, and then others are more important than

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.040
 ourselves.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 Again, I will say in a debate, dagi nyamba, dagi nyima, and dagi yinchi.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 That means, dagi nyamba means that we all are equal.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:38.040
 That means myself and all the sentient beings, every living body, equal every aspect, every way.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.330
 So therefore, then we really develop the bodhicata. Because I want to be happy, and the same way

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.040
 they want to be happy,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.040
 I don't want suffering, and similarly, so we all equal. That's what is called dagi nyamba, really.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.040
 And of course, you all know that.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:08.040
 And the second is that dagi yinchi means then exchanging, and exchanging our happiness and peaceful

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040
 giving to the others,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.040
 and others, those difficult troubles are taken inwardly, mentally, like that.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 And that is dagi yinchi.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 And then dagi yinchi means then others are even more important than ourselves.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 That means, this time, the third time, we completely reverse our attitude normal in samsara times.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.040
 In the world, when samsara normal, regular our thought, I'm more important than others.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.040
 Because I'm the first, and then the others are second.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.040
 But this time, we completely reverse that.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
 Others are more important than myself.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.040
 So reverse, because of your compassion and bodhicata.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 So those are all known as wishing bodhicatas, exercise the wishing bodhicata.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.040
 Once we have that, then we are applying that to actualize the bodhicata.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.040
 Again, it's not something that you have to do first, this, and second, and follow that.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.040
 But I'm just very loving. I'm talking very hard, very loving.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.040
 But otherwise, as soon as we have wishing bodhicata in our heart and mind,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.040
 you can also, or we can also practice the actualizing bodhicata according our capabilities.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.040
 But how is developing that?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.040
 That's kind of strongly, very beautifully, that's what in the teachings say.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 First is wishing bodhicata, and second is actualizing bodhicata.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.040
 Or at least, when we have the wishing bodhicata, when we have that wishing bodhicata,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.040
 sincerely, compassion toward in our heart, mind, like to help each other,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040
 that is then active in the second motivation,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.040
 the determination you open your heart, or our heart, to the others.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 That is actualizing bodhicata.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.040
 Actualizing bodhicata has numerous practices in bodhisattva head,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.040
 but this summarizes all the beneficial activities of the great bodhisattvas.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.040
 Courageous bodhisattvas are in the six parameters.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.040
 So then, we went six parameters, one after another,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.040
 let it become thoroughly, slowly by slowly, we went one after another.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.040
 And first is generosity.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.040
 Second is ease, then morality.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.040
 Third is then patience.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.040
 Fourth is joyful effort for the virtues.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.040
 And fifth is concentration.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.040
 Sixth is then wisdom.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 Among those six parameters, we went post-pose.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.040
 Still, we are going on the fifth parameter, which is concentration parameter.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.040
 We are going still on that.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 And concentration parameter is particularly connected to the mental states.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:09.040
 Fourth three parameters, I mentioned, is more how to take care of our activities of the body,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.040
 of speech, when we are helping to the other beings.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.040
 That is more, like, the fourth is more kind of outreaching violence.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.040
 And that is, third one is the mental mind, the most powerful.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.040
 Behind the scenes, who is really activating generosity?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.040
 Who is activating the morality?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040
 Who is activating patience?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040
 This activated also joyful effort is no other than the mind.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 So now take care of the mind.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 Mind is the most powerful among all the time.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 And that is, we went through, of course, you all know.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.040
 You all, we all received the teaching, you all know that.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.040
 According to Buddhism, mind controls everything.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 Not just control, mind produced both samsara and nirvana.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 Both are moved from this one's own mind, not talking mind to someone else.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:17.040
 Our own mind, my own mind, produced my destinations,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 my environments of samsara.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.040
 And also it will produce, it will expand my nirvana too.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.040
 Same way to you and others as according to Buddhism.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 Buddhism.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:41.040
 And also it is really true, in a way, when we look at our own thoughts

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.040
 and our own constructions and activities, everything is really motivated by mind.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:53.040
 Everything, what we do, everything, all the activities, everything.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 So, therefore, all the feelings, our perceptions, our concerns, our ideas,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:09.040
 our beliefs, our deeds, and that, whatever is there, that all is really produced,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.040
 created, maintained, up-kept by the mind.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.040
 So therefore, now, look into the mind.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.040
 And the present of our mind is so busy, so active.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.040
 It's not rest at all.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 Even maybe we don't feel that.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.040
 But now we need rest.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 We need to relax.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040
 And we rest and relax.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 In the teaching, imagine it.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.040
 Then you really will discover so many beauties, so many wonders.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.040
 Within this, from our own mind, one after another,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040
 those unfolding wonders will show up.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.040
 It will be one after another.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.040
 Those are known as the development of the samadhis,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 all different stages according to the teachings.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.040
 So that all starts from mind.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:12.040
 For that reason, then this beyond paramata is so important.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.040
 Then paramata is divided into these three sections. Again, I'm repeating that.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.040
 As I said already, and you already know those.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.040
 I'm told, and then you know those.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.040
 And those three samadhis or dhyans are the first is, in it very, as I said,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.040
 ji pa, nya tuk, or something.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.040
 Dong ram, ji pa, second is dong ram, ji pa, something.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.040
 Third is the ji shi pa, ji pa, something.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.040
 Those are very important.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.040
 If I translate it roughly into English, of course you can look better translations.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.040
 You can find out. Maybe you already know.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:01.040
 But first is, I'm translating this ji pa, nya tuk, ji pa, nya tuk, something.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:09.040
 I'm translating the beginner, general meditation states. That's what I'm translating.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.040
 Ji pa, nya tuk, every beginner meditation states.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.040
 Second is, dong ram, ji pa, something.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 I'm translating, exploring the deep meaning,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.040
 samadhi of the deep, exploring the deep meaning of the nature.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.040
 That is the second.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.040
 Third one, devi ji pa, ji pa, something, I'm translating.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.040
 As the samadhi that will even please the Buddhas or the Atharadas,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.040
 those are, I'm translating them.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.040
 And the fourth is, daur, so that are the three divisions.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:02.040
 And as I already said, you all know what is nature for the identity of the samadhis or liyans.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:09.040
 Not destructed. Not destructed. That's it. Not destructed.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 By what? By our mind.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.040
 Whatever the cause can be, may be, but not destructed.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.040
 What is the cause? Highlight of what again a great teacher, Bodhachaka Muni's teaching,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:31.040
 that which he highlighted by many older, there goes great masters, true destructions,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.040
 physical destructions, and mental destructions.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:46.040
 Both are obstacles of the dhyana paravatas, dhyans, or the meditation,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.040
 or the concentrates, dhyana paravatas.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:56.040
 And our fourth one is Bodhi, destructions of the Bodhi.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:04.040
 And all the activations of the Bodhi and speeches, mundane activities,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:10.040
 or even the spiritual activities, physical activities.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:19.040
 Anywhere, keeping busy, busy, not letting the time to rest of the mind.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.040
 A busy is just a complete kind of busy, that business of the Bodhi,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:35.040
 physical business of the verbal, that is the first destructions of the physical destructions.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.040
 Second is mental destructions, or mental businesses.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.040
 So order to avoid those two businesses, first you go to the hermitage.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.040
 I say those, and you all know hermitage, or go to retreat.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.040
 Those are standard terminologies that we all know.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:07.040
 Once you go in a reachy land, now the most important is the business of the mental activities,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.040
 particularly during the sitting sessions, meditation time,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.040
 not keeping the business and mental destructions.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:30.040
 That is, again we are distracted that our calling of the meditation is devilated or deluded.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.040
 Even we have the posture in sitting in a retreat, quiet in peaceful places,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.040
 where our mind is a complete business, everywhere around it.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:46.040
 That is not calling, calling, calling, very good calling in meditation.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.040
 And these are the stories.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.040
 Quite a few times, and I remember that.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.040
 And many of you have heard that.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:01.040
 These are the stories of the various films, meditation masters,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:08.040
 great teachers in a debate of Buddhism and particularly Rupakaji lineages.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:16.040
 And which is known as, then, Rupakalay. Many of you have heard that.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.040
 These great, crazy wisdom yogis, very highly visualized beings, Rupakandas.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.040
 And according to this story, Rupakalay has another brother,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.040
 who was a very big lama, big teacher, too.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:37.040
 But he is the head of the monasteries, big monasteries, monasteries.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.040
 And I heard his name, Awen Chudyar.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:48.040
 One day, they both decided to do retreat, the hermetic retreat.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:54.040
 Rupakalay said to his brother, Awen Chudyar, when they proposed each other like that,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.040
 he said, "Are you sure you can do the re-retreat?"

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.040
 "To it?"

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.040
 "Yes, I'm deciding, and I can do that. I would like to do that. I will do that."

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.040
 So then, if you really can do the retreat, then we will do it together.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.040
 But every one of us leave the retreat.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.040
 He said, "Om, you leave the retreat. I'm not going to stay. My selfish retreat.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:24.820
 I'm going to go right back, moment. Right that time, as soon as you leave the retreat, I will leave

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.040
.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 I'm not going to do retreat with you."

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:36.040
 I think that's it. And his brother, Vic Lamo, quickly said, "What are you saying?"

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:42.040
 "If I make a decision to go retreat, whatever the time, the moment they decided,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.040
 one week, or two months, or one month, or whatever that is, I'm going to stay that long retreat.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.040
 What are you saying?"

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.040
 "I'm sure," his brother, the Rupakalay, said, "I'm sure you can do that."

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.040
 "Yes, I'm willing to do that. I do that."

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.040
 Again he said, "Every year, the retreat grows. I'm not going to stay.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.040
 My selfish retreat has stayed in a cage. I'm not going to stay in a cage.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.040
 I'm going to leave right that moment. Moment."

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:21.040
 So, then they decided to go retreat. They went to retreat, both in influence.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.040
 According to the teaching, Rupakalay can read the mind of others.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.040
 Such is great in life being yogis.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.040
 So, now they are doing retreat, both are enjoying, very beautifully, perfectly.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:41.040
 But this other brother, Nami Chijap, he sends his head to the monasteries,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.040
 and then occasionally he is thinking of the welfare of the monasteries,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.040
 the administer aspect of the monasteries, and the monks and all that.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 So, one day he started really thinking only about the administers

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.040
 of the aspect of the monasteries.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.040
 Right that moment, Rupakalay came out of the retreat cabin.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.040
 He made a big noise.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.040
 "Since you are not staying in the rule of the retreat,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.040
 I'm not going to stay in my retreat.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.040
 I'm not going to keep my body in a cage.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.040
 And I'm going to leave right now as we decide."

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.040
 So, he left the retreat.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.040
 So, that is really his story.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 For example, if you keep the retreat when you are in a retreat cabin,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:42.040
 our mind is busyness and keeping one day all over the world,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.040
 all over the vast memories and future plans,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.040
 present activities of the world, the pleasure sensual objects of this and that,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.040
 back and forth, all that.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:00.040
 Then all of the retreat is really losing and deluded.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.040
 Therefore, this is of course Nupakalay.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.040
 He is a very famous enlightened being.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.040
 He can do those.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 Of course, many of us, our mind can wander a different place

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.040
 during the retreat or even during the meditate.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.040
 But the moment we realize, really we don't let that go.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.040
 That's why I said the other day, and you all know,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.040
 one of the teachings said, "Keep the focus."

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:37.040
 Well, pillar of the focus by the love of the mindfulness,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.040
 tied up the mind by the love of the mindfulness

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:50.040
 and tied up to the pillar of the focus,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.040
 and a right by consciousness.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.040
 Our training is provided by consciousness.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:06.040
 That tells us how mind has to be maintained,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.040
 really, joyfully, with the relaxation,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.040
 but yet with the determination and with mindfulness

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 and consciousness, consciousness.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040
 Those are really the important.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040
 So that is what I really mentioned.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:30.040
 So now, with that understanding, again, we go back to that.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.040
 Now I say three samadhis, three dhyana paramatas.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.040
 Now we go, how we do that meditation.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.040
 The first thing, of course, you all know again,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.040
 that is, now we are going to focus.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.040
 Focus, that means focus as a pillar.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.040
 Now we are going to focus to that, our mind,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:02.040
 with the rob, or with the assessment of the rob of the mindfulness.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:09.040
 Rob, R-O-P-E, I believe, rob of the mindfulness.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.040
 Well, hold to that pillar of the focus, or object of focus.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.040
 An object of focus is now about this stage.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:27.040
 Meditation is known as shamatha meditation, or cheni meditation.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.040
 I said, as I said the other day,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.040
 there is a numerous techniques of the concentration of focus,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.040
 but I am going to summarize, or I am going to not summarize,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040
 I am going to just two ways.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.040
 Two, focus outwardly, focus inwardly.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.040
 And if I focus outwardly, I have also two,

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.040
 with the regular object, with the holding object.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.040
 I start, I lay out that.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.040
 Whether, but whether the numbers, the techniques are there,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.040
 the primary is same, quality is same, have to focus.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.040
 That is the focus, that is what it is.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.040
 Happy focus.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.040
 So now, with the holding object, or with the regular objects,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040
 we lay out.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.040
 And that is again, I already mentioned,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.040
 with the regular objects, such as marble, small crystal,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.040
 small stone, your distance,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.040
 all three elbows, size, distance, about that, that,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.040
 put right in front of you.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.040
 And with the seven posts of the Gudavara Chyana,

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.040
 or whatever posture you got,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.040
 but trying to stay straight up your back spines,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.040
 and health, health, kind of more,

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.040
 also a corner line of the spines.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.040
 Focus to that object.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.040
 Object.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.040
 That object, where you focus as in the teaching,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040
 use the metaphor, example, metaphor, as rhythm.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.040
 Now you are, that is your rhythm, or our rhythm.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.040
 Now keep up that continually, without distracted.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.040
 That is mindfulness's role.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 Drop.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.040
 Who is watching that?

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.040
 It's the mind.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.040
 Monkey mind's neck is,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.040
 or a drunk elephant's neck is tied up,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.040
 or a drunk horse's neck is tied up,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.040
 a rope of mindfulness tied up with it.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.040
 With the object, the focus of the rhythm.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 Now you are going to keep that.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.040
 Keep that.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.040
 How long, how long are you going to keep that?

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.040
 As long as you can stay.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.040
 Or you have time.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.040
 Ten minutes, fifteen minutes,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.040
 all five minutes, whatever you have time.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.040
 Well, you are watching that.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.040
 What is it, or where you are ready to, how that?

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.040
 And the teaching said,

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.040
 I said already last time, and you all know,

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.040
 comfortable, spaciousness,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.040
 relaxedness, not creating tensions,

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.040
 tightness, uncomfortable, kind of pause for that.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.040
 Relax.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.040
 Now you are really trying to touch your inner nature,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.040
 our inner nature.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.040
 Don't have to create the tension.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.040
 Tension is unnatural.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.040
 We are trying to go back to the natural states.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.040
 Relax, calm, peaceful.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.040
 That way, see?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.040
 And of course, before this, to start meditation,

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 I also mentioned, mentioned with,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.040
 with pause, pause, pouring on like a toss,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.040
 and the body, jettas, and devotions.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.040
 And with those thoughts, calling down my thoughts,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.040
 or the linear breath, according to what, you know,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.040
 those kind of sizzling energy,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.040
 warming up those breath.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.040
 Really giant, great, full stone prison of the lineage masters,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.040
 the Buddha, Mārāpa and Māsambhāma,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.040
 and their blessings coming, showering down to us,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.040
 to all the beings, finally dissolved,

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.040
 merged into your own nature of the mind.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.040
 Now you meditate.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.040
 You meditate with that.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040
 Continue.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.040
 Continue with that.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.040
 At that time, also, if your eyes are open,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040
 or the focus, whatever,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.040
 but in the most of the time, in the teaching mentioned,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.040
 semi-openness, so it's not something that close eyes.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.040
 But many times, people prefer to close eyes,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.040
 and I think that's also okay.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.040
 But if you open the eyes, semi-open,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.040
 semi-eye open, not completely open.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.040
 Why do you open, not close, semi-open?

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.040
 Also in the teaching, say, not blanking the eye,

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.040
 not moving the eye.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.040
 Reason, I said all other days, too, in the teaching said,

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.040
 because mind is very much connected to the wind.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.040
 Wind is very much connected to the channels, or nervous systems.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.040
 Nervous systems is also very much connected,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.040
 during that time, to our eyeballs, eyes.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.040
 So therefore, stable, stable eye,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.040
 resting eye will help to channel rest.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 Channel rest will help.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.040
 It will help to the wind.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.040
 And when the wind is a little more rested,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.040
 it will naturally help calm down our mind.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.040
 When our calm down mind is more calm down rested,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.040
 then the beauty of nature of the mind will begin to shine.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.040
 So therefore, rest there, relax.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.040
 That's the really teaching said.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.040
 So that is focus within regular objects.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040
 Regular objects.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.040
 Focus within all your objects.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.040
 That is then, same thing.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.040
 But instead, those marbles and crystals,

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.040
 any kind of other object,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.040
 in the many times the teaching said,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.040
 focus to the Buddha status.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.040
 Buddha status, small Buddha status every year,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.040
 small Pukkyo, kind of nice and bright,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 that kind of quite clear one,

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.040
 and put right in front of the spot,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:52.040
 same distance where you put in the marble or crystals.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.040
 And focus to the Buddha.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.040
 Buddha, any, no, Buddha, of course, is known as Buddha,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.040
 is the golden god.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:09.040
 Pukkyo, calm, peaceful, relaxed, open, very grounded.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.040
 That is what Buddha is.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.040
 He is calming.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.040
 Even merely thinking of Buddha,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.040
 it will bring the peace, calmness in our heart and mind.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.040
 And Buddha is also simple.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.040
 There is not many things.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.040
 And focus to the pad, eyes, or the face.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.040
 Buddha, focus to that.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.040
 So, same thing, focus.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.040
 Even your focus to the Buddha,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.040
 with mindfulness, raw,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 as a standard of the consciousness,

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 our mind will go away.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.040
 That, go away.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.040
 That is just a recollect in this.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.040
 Go away.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.040
 But without making any kind of a question or worries,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.040
 and thought that as soon as we realize it,

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 bring back to the focus, to the Buddha's stitches,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.040
 and concentrate on the Buddha's image.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.040
 Image.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.040
 At the beginning of time, again, what you said,

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.040
 you will feel some degree of the calmness.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.040
 That is naturally the quality of the meditation,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.040
 when we touch to our nature of the mind.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.040
 That is, that every individualist,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.040
 when they start meditating,

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:39.040
 according to teaching, everyone will feel that calm, peaceful,

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.040
 kind of quietness.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040
 It feels something.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.040
 We can take deep breaths.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.040
 The calmness is relaxing. Touching to the nature, you can feel that.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.040
 That all, everyone.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.040
 Even if we feel that, then, next to that moment,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.040
 the mind is so busy.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.040
 It is carried by the old, old habit of happiness.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.040
 Our wandering towards the five pleasure objects,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.040
 aliens, of your five pleasures,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.040
 good or bad, or whatever those,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.040
 medium, mixture, old, that really carry.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:20.040
 Those are known as the goba in it a bit,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.040
 wildness of mind.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.040
 Wildness of mind.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.040
 And then, maybe sometimes, because during that time,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.040
 maybe we meet mind, it becomes more kind of chattering,

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.040
 it becomes very calm,

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.040
 it becomes more calm and peaceful.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.040
 Not just that, but more than that, it becomes more kind of foggy,

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.040
 dullness, sleepiness, then fall asleep.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.040
 That is known as sinking the mind.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.040
 That both are obstacles of the meditation.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.040
 What we need, that's not mindfulness, but consciousness.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.040
 Consciousness will bring adjustment.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.040
 Bring both.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.040
 There is too much busyness.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.040
 And bring calm, bring down calmness.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.040
 There is too much, like, kind of dullness.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.040
 Again, consciousness will have to wake up,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.040
 bring more clarity in the mind.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.040
 And particularly in the teachings,

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.040
 those who see, whether it is wildness

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.040
 or whether it is sinkingness,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.040
 in that time, you can also do really some prayers,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.040
 such as thinking of the four, you know, second thoughts.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 In part of this, spiritual lives,

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.040
 reflecting those just even for one minute,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.040
 will help to wake up our mind, adjust the mental status.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.040
 Or sometimes, create both each other, compassion,

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.040
 reaching good thoughts, such as full boneless.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:58.040
 May all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness,

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.040
 such as loving-kindness prayers.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 May all living beings suffering and cause of suffering,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.040
 sincerely reflecting my two thousand meanings,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.040
 and joining them.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 That also really will adjust the mind.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040
 It will calm down.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.040
 After that, again, relax.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.040
 Relax.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.040
 Again, it is continually happening in the teachings.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.040
 Sometimes, you can focus.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.040
 Focus then, such as, like, that is more kind of inwardly there.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:39.040
 And focus some syllable arts right on our current jakras,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 white syllable art in our current jakras,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.040
 or white syllable art on the naval jakras.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.040
 Ground jakras, naval jakras,

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.040
 those, whatever your focus today, that will help.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:59.040
 Again, help to adjust, calm down the mind.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.040
 And so, this is the meditation, focus, or outward, to outwardly.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.040
 Then, inwardly focus of the meditation, or concentrations.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.040
 Again, I'm going to talk two.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.040
 The regular one and the holy one, or the noble one.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.040
 The other one is very popular in the Buddhist teachings,

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.040
 that we all know, the breathing.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.040
 Focusing our mind on the breathing.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.040
 Breathing.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 And that breathing came from the nostrils.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.040
 That means we are seven postures of the Buddha-vera-jhana,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040
 or whatever the postures.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040
 Five postures of the Buddha-vera-jhana,

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.040
 six postures of the Buddha-vera-jhana,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 according to whatever you can do.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.040
 But let breathing came from the nostrils.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.040
 And that breathing came as gently as it should be.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.040
 Or that means normal, there's nothing changed yet.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.040
 And watching the breathing going in and out.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:13.040
 That means your awareness, your concentration is with breathing now.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 Your mind is with breathing.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.040
 And when breathing is going out, we see.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.040
 Our breathing is going out.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.040
 When it is calm, we see.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.040
 Inwardly, you see, breathing is coming inwardly.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:36.040
 On the other hand, you see, exhale, you see, inhale.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.040
 Exhale, inhale, gently, as it should be.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.040
 Calm and peaceful, nothing changed.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.040
 Quietly focusing on the breathing.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040
 In and out.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.040
 If you do that, or sometimes you can calm.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.040
 For example, nine times.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040
 Calm.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.040
 Calm the breathing.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.040
 For example, inhale and exhale as one.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040
 One.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:11.040
 And that is, then, that means you're focusing to your mind with breathing

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.040
 at the same time with that number.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 So that is, again, breathing becomes the pillar, object of focus.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.040
 And your mindfulness is watching, keeping up.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.040
 Up, our mind really breathing.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:40.040
 So that time, our breathing and mind become as one.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 And in the teaching, say, also, breathing is very much connected with the mind,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.040
 or the air, or the wind is very much connected to the mind.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:57.040
 And therefore, also really, conveying breathing is very powerful, natural.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.040
 Naturally, it will serve down the mind, it will calm, it will bring calmness.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.040
 So that is, like as many of you all know already,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:14.040
 but that is like focus with inwardly, with our physical kind of what call it this,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.040
 of the breathing of focus.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:24.040
 Then, the holy focus of inwardly, with the holy object,

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:33.040
 again we then, same thing, visualize or meditate the Buddha

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.040
 right in our heart centers and beautiful lotus petals,

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 beautiful lotus petals or earth petals, lotus petals.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.040
 And many of the earth lotus petals, there is golden Buddha,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.040
 the rainbow Buddha is residing in our heart centers.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:57.040
 And in the same way, focus to the Buddha, Buddha.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.040
 And that is then, keep the same way, as long as you can.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.040
 Same techniques, but only slightly different than the object of the focus.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.040
 In the teaching mentioned many times,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.040
 whether it is out of focus or outwardly immediate of the Buddha,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.040
 or inwardly Buddha it really will help our visualizations,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.040
 such as the visualizations that Vaidyana teaches.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:29.040
 Because it is similar to the blessings of the Vaidyas and therefore it will bless,

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:36.040
 it will help to kind of brighten, strengthening and clarity of the visualizations too.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.040
 So that is what the object of the, there are two things.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:47.040
 Then I taught one more concentrate, and that is non-purpose concentrate.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.040
 That means no focus.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.040
 This is again same posture, same thing, but no focus.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 The moment look to our thought, with the thought arising,

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.040
 that moment look to one's own mind.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:13.040
 And when you look to your own mind, there is nothing you find, or will find.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.040
 Relax in that state.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 That's it, hold that.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.040
 No thought, no focus.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.040
 Relax in that state, as long as you stay.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:36.040
 That is known as, no focus of the Yamada meditations.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.040
 Now, when we do this Yamada meditations, continually,

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:45.040
 according to the teaching, that at the beginning of time, what our feelings,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:52.040
 anybody can feel is calmness, peacefulness.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:57.040
 But if we continue to meditate, keep that concentrate.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.040
 Then three visible experiences will come up.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.040
 And that we all heard so many times, you all know.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.040
 Those are the experiences of the blissfulness,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.040
 clarity, and no force.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.040
 Those three experiences will come.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.040
 And the fourth is, blissfulness experiences.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.040
 Not just the kind of feel of the calmness and the peaceful,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.040
 but that time, if you really continue meditating,

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.040
 according to the teaching, that you will feel more happiness.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:41.040
 Without any reason, particularly, you feel more happy, more relaxed,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.040
 particularly more happiness, more peaceful.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:52.040
 That is known as calmness or the blissfulness experiences.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.040
 And the opposite also in some teachings says,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.040
 can feel more kind of emotion too, sometimes.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.040
 Become more kind of emotion like that, suddenly.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:10.040
 But then, whatever it is, it is not something that is a high result of the meditation.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.040
 We are achieving that, but it really means, in the teaching said,

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.040
 it means we progress, we develop.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:24.040
 So now, either way, don't want to hold onto those experiences.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:31.040
 Continue the meditation, same way as we started.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:37.040
 Started with beautiful motivation, thought, intention, and meditation.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.040
 Course in it.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.040
 Sometimes those experiences, instead of very happiness, peaceful,

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.040
 and all the changes you see, are not just completely kind of those disabled,

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:56.040
 but at the same time, you can start feeling sometimes more kind of clarity,

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.040
 more kind of smartness, more kind of ideas,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:07.040
 more kind of intelligence, more brilliant attitude,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.040
 more kind of intelligence that feels more kind of clarity,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.040
 more smart and more kind of knowledgeable,

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.040
 and kind of we can become more noticeable than before.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.040
 And again, this is the sign of the development.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:33.040
 Sign of progress is not something big progress, big high result according to the teachings.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.040
 So that, and even teaching says that, those good practitioners,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.040
 even can see through the walls, or behind the walls,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.040
 those kind of brightness, clarity can show up.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.040
 And then this is, sometimes the experience is more thoughts.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.040
 At that time, you can feel all my meditation has become so calm and peaceful.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.040
 Now even I don't have any consultations or thoughts.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:08.040
 I completely can't relate to the lost thoughts, feeling of kind of where all the thoughts have gone

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.040
,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.040
 and those are called not thought experiences.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.040
 These thoughts, these three experiences, according to the teaching,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:24.040
 according to the great masters, is normal, procedural experiences, experiences.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:32.040
 A sign of the we are moving forward, of our meditation, and suddenly progresses.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:42.040
 But those who all are known as experience or flavor, taste of the meditation, flavor or taste.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:51.040
 Taste, we should not attach it, grasping and think this is a sign of high result.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.040
 It's just beginner status. Beginner status, as I said earlier,

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:01.040
 the three samadhis when we divided, or not we divided as a divided in the teaching,

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:13.890
 this is the process, process status, that you are experiencing the flavor or the taste of the

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.040
 meditation.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:25.040
 And there is also kind of feel that many times we meditators are looking for those flavors,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:33.040
 such as peaceful, blessfulness, clarity, not thought, kind of those we are looking for.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:45.040
 Therefore, it is also in the category of the regular general meditators, meditation states.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:51.040
 So that is the process of samadhis.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:58.040
 And that is my talk for today, and thank you very much again everyone for participating,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:04.040
 and thank you so much. Thank you everyone again, thank you.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:10.040
 Now we start to do our practices again, the healing practices.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:19.040
 Thank you. And we have that government, please open the movement.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.040
 Start with the seven line prayer again, as we did.
