00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.240
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, welcome. Thank you very much for coming and again,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 participating.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 And again, we are continually doing the retreat together with the Zoom retreat and the situation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The circumstances alone are something that we never really thought before.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 It's happening in a way. That way is wonderful. We can all get connected over there.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And discussing the teachings of the great teacher of the Buddha Chaturmani, a lineage of masters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.540
 Some do also support and help each other, support each other in a way that we are inspired to each

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.000
 other.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.360
 And practicing, deepening practices of our love and kindness and comparing thought for all living

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 beings.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 That's what we are talking. That was where we are really trying to learn that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And so that's what we are really doing today, which is really wonderful.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 According to Buddhism, there is nothing better and best and beautiful than this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And nothing more meaningful than this. That's what, believe it or not,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 all of this, our great teachers, Buddhas, bodhisattva, enlightenment things,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 these, they are doing now. And we are following their footsteps in a way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 So it's wonderful. Again, thank you for this, again, opportunity and situation.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Thank you again. And therefore, again, we are going to extend our view,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 the motivation of the joy and appreciation and bodhicata and vastness,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 purely the motivation of the Vedayana teaching. And then again, we reflect the teachings.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And again, teaching, we are going, continually following the teachings by Japneer.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And that which is, again, the title is, what is this?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Okay. I've been doing this while, so I'm going to do this title.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Heart advice for the 14 new ones.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 By, he is known as Abhijal Mooji. And that's the meaning of the oscillation in the Tibet.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 It is the Godly Namna, Nitya Theva Lava. And what that actually really means.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Heart, because of loving-kindness, love to all the beings

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and those who are any dedicated practitioners, this is the heart advice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Heart advice from his son is the Guruji to all of us, to all of us.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So this is, in a way, his legacy and his representatives.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Even though his physical is not existing now,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 he entered Mahaparinarana over maybe 30 years ago.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 But this is his legacy teaching, the representative of that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So even though we didn't maybe have the opportunity to see his physical,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 but this is what we really see. This is really his teaching.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 This is him. He is talking.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 In a way, that's what we are really following, his footsteps.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 So therefore, again, this is the beautiful, those beautiful intentions.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And now we go to what we've been discussing this.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 To summarize it, you can entirely practice over the God of the Nama

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 and put that into three frames.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And those are the three nobles, Ambasson, Yorasimpi Thamba, Muyi Thamba and Yohoa Thambas.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Those are the individual, they said.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 But roughly translation is beginning noble is.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 The first noble is the Bodhicata and the beautiful intentions.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And the middle noble is without grasping, clinging practices

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 or without any grasping, clinging.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And the conclusion noble is then dedication and aspirations.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Those are the three.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And now we are going on the beginning of that noble.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 But this beginning noble is not just a beginning in time,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 then you kind of leave there and move to the next stage.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 But this is all the way to the practices.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 To all the way to the final stage of our practices,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 but all the way to get enlightenment.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Purify our obscurations, discover our enlightenment.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 That is really beginning with the Bodhicata and the beautiful intentions.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 And Bodhicata, again we are talking about those are again two subdivisions.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 I already said, so I'm not going to repeat it again and again then.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 But today we are going to again Bodhicata.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Bodhicata is the principle practice of the entire Yandere Buddhism,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 particularly Supta Ramahayana and Vaidhyanas.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 This Bodhicata practice, mind of enlightenment.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Bodhicata also begins with a few subdivisions in life.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 But to summarize the Bodhicata into two principles.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Wishing Bodhicata and actualizing Bodhicata.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Bodhic is wishing Bodhicata and that is how we develop in our heart, the impure heart.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Again Bodhicata is our nature of the mind.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Nature of the mind has what?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Always in the teachings, the natural mind is emptiness.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 The natural mind is cloudiness.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 This low incline in the competition is the clarity aspect of the nature of the mind.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 It is, it is the natural mind.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.550
 When we are activating Bodhicata, we are activating the clarity aspect of the mind or the nature of

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.000
 the mind.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Clarity is lowing kindness, clarity is compassion, clarity is wisdom.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 We are activating, when we are activating the clarity of the nature of the mind,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 what it does, it will defeat it, all the negativities, ignorance, ego clingings,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 those obstacles of the mental emotions.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 All the FISGS views another simple word.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 The cause of the suffering truth will be dispelled by rising up the awakened mind of the Bodhicata.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.620
 So therefore, when we practice Bodhicata, we are touching our heart, the core of the heart and our

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.000
 own true nature.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And therefore that is how we develop that, how we arise that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 That is what the greatest teacher of the Bodhicata community uses.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 This is not just that Bodhicata said that and that is what we can follow.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 That is how we can do it.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Because we have been so long time in the samsara, from the biggest time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Our potential, our nature is doomed, is blurbed, is shadowed.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 To wake up that immediately, we cannot do it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Therefore, we use by gradual skillful means and raise up our vitality, our energy, our potential,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 our hidden nature,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 our hidden breathing or worry we have to wake up.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And to do that is called Wishing Bodhicata.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.810
 This intention, the seedling, beautiful intention, arises from the depths of our pure heart with

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.000
 love,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 with kindness, with compassion for all living beings without any borders, without any restrictions,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 without any convolution, partialities is arising, so beautiful, so genuine, it's naturally arising.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And that is known as Wishing Bodhicata.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 That is Wishing Bodhicata is now how we act with that Wishing Bodhicata.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 For this way I said, not I said, in the teaching said, those are called Boneless.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless rejoice and joy, and boneless equanimities.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 This boneless is, we love to all the sentient beings.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 We love to our relatives, we love all the close, our close ones, we love all the beings.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 That's really known as boneless love.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Love is also not partialities.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Same term compassion is not partialities.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Same term rejoice is not partialities.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Same term is equanimity is not partialities.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Equanimity is for all.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And in many different ways we echo.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So therefore, what is also equanimity?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 I got all of some questions about the equanimity, and which is really true, right?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Sense, sense, and which is that question they ask.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 You see, individuals ask that if we don't...

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 How this is prepared.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Pre-prong, attachment to the close ones, rejection to the others, close ones.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 If we don't have the attachment to close ones, how we can help and support the close ones.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 I think that's the question.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 It's a very good answer.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 One question is true.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 But this time, our attachment to the close ones is so emotional, both times.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Best of the emotionless.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 It didn't mean that we should not love to our close ones.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 We love to every living beings.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Love to our close ones.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Love to every one.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 But not emotionally to the division.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Respect the divided zones.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 This is love on us.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 This is not love on us.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 The moment we see the world, our loved ones.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Which is wonderful, beautiful, really good in samsara.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 But in the dharma level, we were talking bodhicata level.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 We met these boundaries, I believe, that world.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Boundaries with loved ones.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 That means there is someone that we don't care.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 That kind of impression right there.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 It's bodhicata.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 The eye of the bodhicata.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 The heart of the bodhicata is equal to everyone.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Love everyone.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 It didn't mean we don't love anyone.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 We love.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 But we love with the gentle, peaceful.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And we got to emotions.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 That is what we talk.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Love emotion.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Let's use the examples.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Sun is shining in the skies.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Shining everyone.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Pretty everyone.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 We don't restrict them.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 We don't emotion.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Similarly, that love kindness to all the beings.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 As sunshine to everyone.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 We don't emotions.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 This is what the blood would call.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Call without attachment.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Attachment.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Generally, of course, the beginning of the practice of the bodhisattvas.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It is, again, in a practical way, we have to go with good attachment and bad attachment.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Bad attachment is bad attachment attracted to our old habit patterns,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 which is not healthy, which is not a good or benefit.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Again, we still struggle with that many times.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Those are known as unhealthy attachments.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 But good attachments, good principles, good customs, good things,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 great peace, and happy, and joy, to all sentiments,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and trying to continue to carry on that.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Those are good attachments.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 That is not something that we have to give up.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Because we have to actualize the bodhisattvas.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Actualize the bodhisattvas.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 We're going to talk that later.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 I mean, now talk that.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 That means we're going to carry on those.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Distinctively, we're going to carry on that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Those all actualize the bodhisattvas.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 So it's not something that we give up every day.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 We do the good things, right things.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Something starts with our good heart.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Something starts with our loving kindness and compassion,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 and poor, boneless.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 So that is really how it is.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 That's, I mean, boneless, or that is our wishing bodhisattva.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Now once we have a good, wishing bodhisattva

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 of those poor, boneless, and hard,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 then we continue to exercise or practice

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 of this wishing bodhisattva, those three different ways.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 And that is, I listed the other day,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 which is, in the debate, da-ji-nyamba, da-ji-jiva, and da-wi-ji-jiva.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Those are the three words.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 The first is da-ji-nyamba means myself and others are equal.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 That is the same as the econimities.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Econimities, we're all equal.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Econ, once we have that kind of understanding,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 good thought in the mentality really,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 not just sing the word by, or pray, just pray,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 but kind of really feel from the heart.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Heart, when you have that,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 then we can again do mentally da-ji-jiva, which is,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 and also western, it's become very popular word, tung-ni,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 the very word tung-ni.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Tung-ni is da-ji-jiva, da-ji-jiva,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 and the other word da-ji-jiva means we're exchanging.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Tung-ni means exchanging.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 That means when you're, the port boneless

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 has become quite strong and beautiful, beautiful,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 then you now lift up that port boneless next level, all equal.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Everyone is equal.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 This equal, again, is not just sing the praise

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 from the heart as you feel.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And our eye of love, everyone is equal.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 And our eye of compassion, everyone is equal.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Our heart, everyone, heart of our love, everyone is equal.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Heart of our compassion, everyone is equal.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Really feel that.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Equal means like me.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But how I?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 I like to be happy, peaceful,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 joy, relaxed, comfortable, same thing.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 The others, same thing, they want to be happy,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 they want to be peace, they want to be joyful,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 they want to be successful, they want same thing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Really, truly.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 That is what they call equal.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Equal.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 That is equal.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 We all equal.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And I said the other day, I mean, you know this,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 I'm not just I'm saying and then you only know that one.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 I shouldn't say we come there that way.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 But we receive those teachings, we know this.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 The emotional level we equal,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 physical level equal or biological level we equal,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 psychological level equal,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 need level equal,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 vision level equal,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 and where we live in this art we live similar things.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So is equal.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Not just only in this world,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 according to Buddha's teaching,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 the beings of six realms have same desire.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 All the beings of six realms have same desire,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 they like to be happy, they like to be peaceful,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 they like to be peaceful, successful,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 they like to be comfortable.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 And everyone is equal.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 But the same thing again, same as like us.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Us, even we want, we're not always achieving that,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 fulfilling that, achieving that.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And we're thinking, we're presuming,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 we're doing something good for us,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 we're doing something for reality, knocking our head.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Because ego clinging,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 negative emotions are completely manipulated,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 deluded and completely diluted.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Diluted so we can't completely join them.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Opposite action is opposite action than our heart really wants,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 what we want.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 That happens.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 That we all join.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Due to the unknown situation,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 ploughing and then even thinking is good for us,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 but doing something bad.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And that's why, that's the reason,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 great-master Shanti Deva said,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 even they wanted happiness, peace,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 they're thinking that I'm really going to get into happiness,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 but reality, they're running for the suffering,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 because of ignorance.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 That's what great-master Shanti Deva said.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 That's true.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 That's what we're really doing.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Therefore, feel compassion.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 How this particular, all these things,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 I mean the desire and the actions are not really matching up there.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 And even they want,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 they're doing something completely different.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And for those reasons,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 I'm going to really develop my enlightenment

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 and make something that I can benefit,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 happy, the goal of your heart,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 all our heart, we have that attitude, thought.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 That is genuine, beautiful,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 wishing both each other.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And then equanimity realizations.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 When equanimity comes on action,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 exactly in action,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I mean this is now of course mental state,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 where there is wishing both each other is mental state.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 But when it comes on action,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 as I said yesterday, I believe yesterday,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 he said what the great-master Papaji said.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And for example, we all ended up in a snowy,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 in a cold weather,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 cold weather in a rainy and blazed places.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 There is only one good blanket,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 one person on that one blanket.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 That person is,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 because everyone is suffering with the same situation,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 therefore that person is not just keeping that blanket

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 by that individual himself or herself,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 but share it to everyone.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 Oh, we all same, we all suffering with this cold,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 so I'm going to help to these two, to all.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 To everyone going to share that,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 sharing that blanket to everyone.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 That's an example of the action.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 I'm not talking, but it's not the time now to do the action,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 because the righteous teacher,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Buddha Kriyayakamuni said,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 even your heart is so strong of your bodhicata,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 but when it comes to the action,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 follow that according to your capabilities and situation.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 We have to practical.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Our journey of the bodhicata activity

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 is not just a few weeks,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 two months,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 two years,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 two lifetime,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 until every living being is rich,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Buddha or enlightenment.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Therefore, we have to this,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 gold is a long last.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Therefore, we have to build up.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 We have to build up.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Slowly, our capabilities,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 our wisdom,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 our knowledge,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 our experience,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 our realizations,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 and we require our obscuraion,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 negative videos,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 and that means also it will build up our capabilities.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Getting stronger and stronger,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 then we expand our capabilities,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 helping support, expanding, expanding,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 and then all the certain things.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 But mental level,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 we must think all the living beings

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 as wishing bodhicata,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 as boundless.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Mind don't have to be limited,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 except the ego clings sometimes,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 in fact, limitation.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 We make boundless.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 But when it comes to the action,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 we have to follow our capabilities,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 our situation,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 our circumstances,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 or even you have the capabilities,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 but others are not ready to receive

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 all your assistance and support.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 That won't help.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 That's good.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 If you push it,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 then we're imposing that.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 That is known as unskillful activity

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 of the bodhicatas.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Therefore, this bodhicata activity,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 benefited activity,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 gentle, peaceful,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 very affectful,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 and very steady,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 and never tired,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 and never woke.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 What the great Master Moon Kim

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 said, "As we pray always,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 may I not be tied to bold

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 to benefit all sentient beings."

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 From your heart,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 our heart,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 be strong,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 firm,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 open,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 relaxed,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 continue,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 but when it comes to the art,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 or reaching to the others,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 do accordinglyness.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 That is what it is.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 So therefore, again, this wishing,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 the equalizing,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 the dahi yamma.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 In other words, again,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 the great Master,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 in the lineage master,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 he said,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 example of when it comes,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 action, for example,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 what he said,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 how he said,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 it's very beautiful.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Examples,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 and I will say again that.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 For example,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 a true man is a traveling target.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Number one,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 one man has really thought of this

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 economic or eco, we are all eco.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 And one man don't have shoes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Walk in bare feet.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 One man has shoes.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 So now, they are again,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 again in a tsunami.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Tsunom.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 So one man has shoes,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 but one man don't have shoes.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And this,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 the person who has bodhicata,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 that equalizing,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 dahi yamma attitude,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 or that realization,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 he take out one of his shoes

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 due to that other ones.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 So now,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 that body individually

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 has one shoe,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 one shoe.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Shoe,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 and one shoe,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 they both don't have one shoe.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 One feet,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 they don't have shoe.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 One feet,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 they have shoe.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 And the shade is shoe.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 That shoe,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 too pretty shoe.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 She has two,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 two feet,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 or feet,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 a pretty shoe.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 They shade to that other version.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 That is known as equalizing.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 When it comes to action,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 for us, of course,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 at this beginning time,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 we cannot do that.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 We have to do slowly

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 our capabilities.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Our capabilities.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 And readiness.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Gradually,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 with joy,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 with appreciation,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 with happy,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 with peace.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Once you do that,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 you feel happy.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Oh, I did something good.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 May I ever do more than that?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Ever to do more,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 even for more future.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Future.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 They're kind of weak in that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 So that is an example of equal.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Equal.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Equal.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 The second is

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 tungmi practices.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Tungmi.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Extending.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Dagi jiwa intrepid.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 That is actually really,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 in the teaching said,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 that is the active body,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 each other's status.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Now, of course,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 in the beginning time,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 we do tungmi practice mentally.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 What do we tungmi mean?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 You're giving happiness to the others.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Happy.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Happiness.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And taking their suffering in the difficulties.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 What great Master Shakti Deva said,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 you give three things.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Your body.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Your wealth.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 Your many choice.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Your merits.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Those I in the teaching said,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 said the object of the clinging.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Where we cling?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Clinging.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 We cling to our body,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 our wealth,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 our merits,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 all our reputations,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 our something tighter, all that.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Now you're giving that way.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Giving that mentally.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 This is a mentally practice.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Again, it is wishing body to the practices.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 That's three things you give.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 How are you going to give?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 How are we going to give?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Without any expectations.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Without any grasping.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 Clinging.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Without any return.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Return in this life.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Return in the next lifetime.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Time.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Without any acknowledgement from others.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 That means what?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 It's open gift, open heart gift.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Gifts.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And that is known as what to this time.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 For example, many times in the teaching say,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 give, give the happiness, peace.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Those ancient great Master of the Kadamsukkul schools

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 use the breathing.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Exhale.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Give all joy and peace, happiness, your merit,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 our meritorious to all the beings.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 Exhale.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Inhale, take all their suffering,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 the difficult troubles,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 courageously taking inwardly.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 During those exercises,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 that is what's called wishing body exercise.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 This is, again, in the teaching says, so powerful.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 So powerful.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 For example, in the teaching say,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 the greatest teacher, Buddha Chaturmani,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 according in his teaching,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 once upon a time,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Buddha was just a regular individual,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 the individual, as many of us.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Regular, that means so many emotions,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 so many negative, so many karma,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 so many emotions.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 That time.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 And that time, Buddha was, that time,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 the privileged reincarnation of the Buddha Chaturmani

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 was inhalerands.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 You heard those stories from many great Masters.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Says, and he was inhalerands.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 One, the other friend, the same person,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 both are inhalerands, they're pulling the iron carriage.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Iron carriage.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 The other individual was very,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 what's called, weak.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 He can't pull the iron.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 The Buddha, the reincarnate, homo reincarnation,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Buddha was strong, so he can't pull,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 and pull, but others, weak can't pull.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Even he cannot pull.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 The other one, this agent of the Hillary,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 beating him with iron fists,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 iron humors, iron humors.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Buddha, the privileged reincarnation of Buddha

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 who was inhalerands pulling the iron carriage,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 feels so compassion to him.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Why he's beating him?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 He cannot pull.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 It's not something that he don't want to do,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 but he cannot.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 I'm going to take that.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 I'm going to take his share.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Today, I'm going to pull out that iron carriage.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 In the teaching, in the Buddha's teaching,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 the moment he had that attitude and thought in his heart,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 the Buddha, the karma of that Hillary,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 being in Hillary, his Buddha spray with the economy,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 completely purified.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 The moment that intention,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 that pure heart, good intention,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 rose in his heart, purified.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 That is karma.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And that is the beginning of the bodhicitta,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 which in bodhicitta, in the teaching,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 said the Buddha, that is the beginning of

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 how he began to check out, redirect his passages.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Then, from that moment,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 he gradually went to the bodhicitta,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 top bodhicitta, and went step by step,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 and became an enlightenment,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 become known as bodhicitta money.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 That's what the really great teacher,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 bodhicitta money, said.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And again, other stories.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 In other stories, our time.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Again, the same thing.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 This is, again, in that mind,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 bodhicitta was already kind of quite good,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 high status of the bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 But he was born as a son of a merchant,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 son of a merchant.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 That merchant family, quite a wealthy merchant family.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 And every time, all the children are dying.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 The babies are dying in the early days,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 one after another.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So, now that another child was born,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 child was born, it was son.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And so, the parent, the warrior,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 so much, again, is going to die, die.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And many times, the customs,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 that customary, maybe they change in the names, names.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 So, even though this son is boy,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 boy, but they named him, like name, as girl.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So, what are his name names?

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Father's name is Zahu,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 and his name is Omu, daughter of Zahu.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Zahu, Zahu.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 But he was not daughter.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 He was, I mean, son, boy.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 So, now, the daughter of Zahu is growing, growing.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Well, he is intense.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 His father died.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And each time, those martians in the teaching said

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 that they go in the ocean to get large jewels

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 from the other shore of the ocean.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 And they go to the ocean by the boat,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 and then iPhone came,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 and everyone died on the sea.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 So, father never returned.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 And mother was so worried.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Now, this son, because in ancient Indian customs

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 of a modern country,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 they go to exactly what the son died,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 exactly the same as what father used to do.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 They followed that kind of family lines.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 So, mother was so much worried.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Worried, he will go, as my son will go in there.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 When he is grown up, he will go in the ocean and all that,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 and he will die there.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 So, now, traditionally, when the son grows up,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and what they do?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 They could do the family activity, father's activity.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 So, father, now the young boy is really growing,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 and he asks mother,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 "What is my father's professional job?"

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And he said, "Oh, your father's professional job

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 is to collect the firewood from the forest

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 and sell that in the city."

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 City, so that is what your father used to do.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 So, then, he thought, "Okay, I'm going to go to my father's job.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 I'm going to collect the dry wood from the forest

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 and sell, bring that back and sell that in the city."

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 City, so he'd been doing that.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 And the manipulper said, "Why are you doing that?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Because this is not your father's job."

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 And then, one after another, he'd lead him.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Then, finally, he understood his father's job is a merchant

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 and go to the ocean.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So, everybody, the young boy, his grown-up boy,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 is a teenager, useful.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 I mean, now, the more than teenagers,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 size his to his friends.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 He said, "Why we don't go to the ocean?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 You tell us, traditionally, your father is like,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 who live yourself.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 You have to do this and that thing."

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 So, mother, he came back to the mother.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 He was so obedient to the mother.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 He said, "Madé, everyone is saying that my father's job is to go to the ocean.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Now, you've kind of tricked me all the time.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 And now, I'm going to the ocean."

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And mother says, "Don't go.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Please don't go.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Don't make that attempt like that.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Don't go."

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 And so, do what I said.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And he said, "No, I'm going."

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 So, that must be made many days.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 I don't know what.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 But, however, finally, mother never changed that statement.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 And he don't want to take that statement.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And finally, he prepared with his friend

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 all those elements of going to the ocean.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 He walked in everything.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 He's going to live.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And mother, when he said, "I'm leaving."

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 I'm leaving.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And mother held his legs.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 And his mother said, "I'm not letting you go.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 We are good."

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 So, he said, "But, of course, he's stronger than mother."

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 So, he kicked the mother and kicked her head and he left.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And mother was so sad.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 She was so bad, bad.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 And now, my son is going to die.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Or something is going to happen if God died this time.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 But it was going to happen.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 This is just terrible.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 She's really upset.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 But, anyway, when he went, on the ocean,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 they got, performed the success.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 They know that every day they got,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 whatever they're looking on the ice, strong,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 or whatever they're looking from the ocean,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 they got and unloaded that on the boat.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And now, returning back, on the way back to the earth,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 again, big typhoon came.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Came.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 And he completely knocked it down.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 And luckily, he hold that one piece of the wool

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 and that kind of swing away, he reached out some islands.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Islands.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Now, I make short, long story short.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And he got some islands.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 And island looks like peaceful, nice.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 But there is some beautiful places.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 He saw many different things.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 One up to another, many beautiful things, good things.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 One up to another.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And there is also so many kind of, like, good things.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 He really experienced a lot of good things.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Almost a kind of dreamland, he reached to the monopolist.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 He enjoyed all the pleasure, sensory objects,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 one up to another.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And then, kind of, in the pilot,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 he said, "You don't go further than this.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Just stay here."

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 But he is in his heart.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 I think he is really, kind of, very, very closely individual.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 He likes to explore.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 He likes to go further and further, wherever he can go.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And he explored.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And then he went to the very big, kind of, looks like,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 very formidable, formidable castle, castle.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 He told him, "Like to go."

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And then, kind of, feel that children go there.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 But again, his heart pulled there.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 And he went.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 And his doors opened.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Immediately, the doors opened.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And movement doors opened inside what he saw.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 There is one man sitting under the wheel,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 the iron wheel, or iron saw.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Saw, S-A-W, I believe.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Saw.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 That is turning saw.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Saw sitting.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 And he spread his head, head completely.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And it's so painful.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 I thought, this dull woman thought, oh, it's terrible.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 So much suffering is happening, suffering happening.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And in the sky, suddenly, the voice came.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 One who is experiencing, or one is going,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 that experience, that suffering must be released.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 One is not experiencing, must be bounded,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 or must come under this.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 The moment that voice came in the sky,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 that moment, that will of the other man is completely released,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 it moved to the right, above the head of Zalipumu.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 And now, his head is spanning.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Head.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 In his head, the skull cups are cutting and spanning, spanning.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 The moment that happened, this Zalipumu had thought,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 oh, so terrible, how this can come, this.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 But whoever went through this, may I,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 what I'm experiencing, may this become substitute

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 to every people who are going that similar situation.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 His really gentleman bodhicitta attitude in his heart

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 rose right that moment.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 That moment, the will, spanning will, is the lift of the sky,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 he was released, released.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 That is a story of the power of the tonic practices.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 There's many beautiful tonic practices.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 By this, the same in the Buddha teaching.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Teaching, so this is what really the power of these practices is,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 so powerful and similarly tonic practice.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Then, then kungli practice.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And now, of course, this time, he's wishing bodhicitta,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 we're doing that as, mentally doing that.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 As he said, said, said, in the ancient time,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 those God of Masters, many a time, said, use the breathing.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Just send all your happiness, peace, joy,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 marriage, joy, good thing, healing, energy,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 turn the nostrils or exhale into all the beings who receive that.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 And they're suffering, difficult troubles are coming in

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 that through your ability, arise coming inward

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 and that is tonic practices.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 Tonic practices.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 So this is dagi, dagi, dagi, jivo, jivo practices.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 And then, dagi, dave, jiki and others are more important than one's own self.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Again, mentally, with these, again, with the mentally practices,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 it's wishing bodhicitta, others are more important than our self.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 With your compassion, with your loving kindness,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 sincerely think that they're all more important.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Why? Because these, all these others, because of the others,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 I'm going to reach enlightenment.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 I'm going to benefit all the sentient beings.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 With all the others, how I can reach enlightenment?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 As I myself alone, that if I don't have the support from others,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I'm not going to reach enlightenment.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 I'm not going to benefit to anyone.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 I'm just not going to open my heart or anything.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 So therefore, they're all so important,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 more precious than me, and more precious.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 They're equally precious than the Buddha, same as Buddha.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Buddha taught us teaching how to practice,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 but actually who is giving us a lesson in training is sentient beings.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 With all the beings, with all the mother sentient beings,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 I will not get enlightenment.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So therefore, others are more dear, more precious,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 more special.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Therefore, that attitude, really wishing, therefore,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 whatever they're going through, it is suffering and difficult.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 I mean, they really have the modes of tonic practices

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 and the davai jinni practices.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 All the others are more important than our son,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 and that is then known as practicing of the wishing bodhicata.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 So that is my brief talk for the wishing bodhicata

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 and now, today, I'm going to be in a way

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 and concluding the wishing bodhicata kind of like that with my talk

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 and then tomorrow, we begin actualizing bodhicata

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 to go through actualizing bodhicata, okay?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, again, for your patience

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 and listening and participation.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Thank you, okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 And then, of course, a lot of videos,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 a story of these others are more important.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 In the previous bodhicata, many life stories

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 or these stories, you know, there are so many beautiful stories.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 There's this, so it's just, and then, again,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 the great master was a singer through his compassion,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 that he gave his own body to protect the other beings.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 I mean, you know that stories, those stories.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 This is according to Buddhism, it's all true stories.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 It's really true stories, because there are others

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 more important than one's own self, anyway.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 And that purified obscurations, obstacles.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And I think I was waiting to get behold,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 and see the future with the material,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 but he practiced so long, so many years, yet he couldn't,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 even in the teaching, he said, even if he didn't have

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 not good single dreams, good dreams,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 he didn't really achieve.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 But because of this great compassion,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 the others are more important than attitude of compassion,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 genuine compassion, then immediately he bit them.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 That purified whole, gone about, that wail between him

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 and the material.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 The future with the material is completely turned on,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 and he able to see that exile, like material,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 right in front of him.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And then, because of that, he went to see the heaven.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 For a short time, which is like a coded human year,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 about 50 years, he stayed there

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 and received more tired teaching of the Buddha,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 his particular teachings, the meanings,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 the hidden meaning of the Pandavarana teachings,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 and he brought such great teachings back to women's art,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 and he was one of the great masters of Buddhism.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 I mean, those old stories that you can read,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 and you can look those things.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 I mean, this is, again, because of that,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 that open draw of his beholding the future with the material,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 was the power of compassion.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 (speaking foreign language)

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 Even other small important,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 he had thought to protect by his own body,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 and that's his stories.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 (birds chirping)
