00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 We stand on our people's intentions and motivations, motivations of them, joy and appreciation as

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000
 we discuss it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 We all know, we are one of the important beings on this planet, on this earth, and have all this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 external, worldly level, out of luxuries, luxuries, that is again so beautiful.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 And not just only that, we are all these good portrayals of the Dharma people's practices that you

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.000
've received.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 I reject, you reject from so many great masters and observe that all in our heart and mind.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.750
 Some believe that our great joy and effort and the courage and commitment we are doing is really

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.000
 wonderful.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Again, we have the courage and commitment, determination and promise that our world makes this more

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 stronger and better to benefit for all the living beings.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And really thinking, sincerely, from the heart and mind, we did joy and appreciation.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 That is the foundation of the Dharma practices as well as also central column of all the practices.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 In the GK world, we said we should practice with joy and appreciation.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Not kind of what I said, and worry, this and that thing. Really just come.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Even there is some difficulty, troubles involved, and we can perhaps something like that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 But this is not trying to reactivate that, those, all those things going on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Just bring more joy, just a short time, for one hour, two hour, twenty-four minutes, and how our

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 brain is more joy and appreciation.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 And put all those inside. That is also a retreat.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 What a retreat means, putting all the mundane consumption, mundane activities on the side and back

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.000
 to the center of where the league belongs.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Retreat and put all the worries and support, the glorious, keep that for one hour or half an hour

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 when we practice trying to do that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Very more joy, more appreciation. And then fill with our heart with that and then both each other.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.090
 See the link, call it from the body, just thinking of all means, vastness, motivation of the body,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000
 just really thinking that sincerely.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And we may all live with the printer of the sufferings.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.540
 And may all living beings have a great joy and peace, happiness, that never connected with

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 suffering in his head.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And they have great economic realization.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 All those beautiful thoughts, intentions in the heart and mind.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And we spread out those good energy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.300
 Then our practice for one hour, three hour, whatever, really, really, something more soothing, more

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.000
 calming, more healing, more rewarding.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And yes, it will kind of shed all of that courage.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 That's how we can put it, by our creation.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 So they are reactivating those. Those are called foundation, basic things.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 But the basic is so important. It is center, it is heart, it is foundation, it is cornerstone.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 We shouldn't think all those are coming, basic and this and that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 That is, if we kind of, we kind of messed up the foundation of the practice, then we really missing

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.000
 the point.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.890
 We miss become old, all the development, all everything what we do, then become a commerce that are

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.000
 unstable with that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 So therefore, like this show, really joy, appreciation, bodhi japa, signaling bodhi japa.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.120
 With all the bodhi japa in the teaching, you openly say that no matter how much highest teaching

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 you receive,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 you start making practice, it won't go to exactly target practice.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Therefore, practice, bodhi japa is so important.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.550
 It really will make everything perfect, everything beautiful, everything exactly as life relate to

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.000
 me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 So therefore, this bodhi japa, and for that reason, Renma's department will say in his teaching,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 you have one thing that is enough, it's bodhi japa, bodhi japa.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.530
 If you don't have one thing, no matter how much practice you have, we are missing the point, point

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.000
 and we lost.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And that is what, bodhi japa.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:31.260
 So therefore, the true unmistakable, the cause and the condition of together enlightenment is bodhi

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.000
 japa.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Therefore, may I have the true bodhi japa in my heart.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 That's what great master, Catherine, will say.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.380
 This is the, as he said, all the Buddhas, all those bodhisattvas, all the energy masters, how much

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.000
 appreciated the bodhi japa, really.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 It's simple, it's love, kindness, completion.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Wisdom thought, that is what the bodhi japa is.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 That will defeat the ego-clinging, that will defeat the obscurations,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 that will purify the self-important attitude.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 It will open the vast, vast, paranormal view of the true nature, exactly what we have.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Because why we're not getting a realization, enlightenment? Because it's blown by the ego-clinging,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 we go by the self-important.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Regimen, the conception, we have to depend on all that.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.840
 When we break that, loosen that up, then, really, the Buddha-nature, the enlightenment, the youth-

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.000
coversed body,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 will shine beautifully and go so perfectly in the teaching.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Mentioned in all the great practitioners, really mentioning those teachings, so we should always

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 remember that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 When we have those bodhi japa, enduring appreciation, beautiful colors in the heart and mind,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.290
 then, the realization of the three Gaias, or the three, you know, whole world, three, three

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.000
 registered,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 those come so easily in the teaching.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.540
 Really, those relaxations will shine because part of the bodhi japa will purify the tenderness, the

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.000
 negativity, the obscurations.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Then, realization of three registered, of three Gaias is naturally inherent, inherent.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Naturally inherent in our nature of the mind.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It's really, in the teaching, all the masters, then it will shine so beautifully, so beautifully.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 All the practicing and the fulfillment, the realization comes so, so nice and so beautiful.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So those are really, in the teaching sense, we should always remember.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Along with that, then it is always in the teaching making.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 But he's told the literal body is highly likely that.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 This is the poor, poor wealth of the practitioners, poor wealth, poor treasures, poor treasures.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.590
 Both these devotions, devotion to the lineage, that is one of the first wealth of the practitioners

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.000
.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Second wealth is the pure perception to each other.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 When your brothers and sisters have the pure perceptions, respect and appreciation,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 pure perception, that is second wealth and second treasures of the practitioners.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Third is, is, then have the great compassion talk.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Complete about all living beings as much as you can.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Start with your friends and family members and all the beings.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Compassion talk.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Have for all the beings of six realms, beings of the hell realms,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 beings of the hungry gods and realms, beings of the animal realms,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 beings of the human realms, beings of the usher realms,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 beings of the gods realms.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Even the gods is, of course, gods realms, the whole place and all that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 But in the teaching making, they have so much trouble.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Particularly toward the end of their lives.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 When the Karmic conditions are exorbitant of Phoenician,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 they don't know, now they're going to change their life status.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Then really in the teaching making, they have so much suffering and trouble.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Because they see what's going to happen.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 What they're hoping.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Before, completely, they were in the lala lands, so happy and joy and all that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 But now, suddenly, kind of lightly coming and see the situation changing.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And all the friends and all everyone before, so associated, so involved,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 so targeted, one united.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 But now they are kind of like almost just standing, just standing.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And their glory and beauties are demolition, getting done in a Dallas.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Dallas.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And they see, now they're going to live.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 In the teaching making, that period of that stage is so much pain and suffering.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 They really have so much trouble.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 So they have trouble.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 So there, all six rams have such a grip.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 You can look, those are, I mean, the teaching making, clearly.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And the great master, the master of Nagarjuna making the letter to his friends.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And that, those are all the different signs that they're going to live these dark rams.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And they get it before they don't have any orders to their bodies.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 But now they have orders, orders.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And before they have ornaments, we do flowers all day.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 They also, those flowers are getting old.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Even you put the new one, it's just getting old.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Kind of, it's just, it makes it, completely, kind of really noticeable to among the groups.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And then all the friends, everyone is also very, somewhat technical.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Oh, now you're going to change.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 You're going to leave this place.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 But make sure you go there and make good things.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Come back here.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Again, we can enjoy all this.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 There's some other thing.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 But no matter whatever is really in the teaching, it's a lot of trouble.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So therefore, in the six rams, there's so much trouble called compassion.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Compassion is the root of the body.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Root of enlightenment.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 As I said the other day, I mean, it's not just I'm saying.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 The great master Kamala Chala.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 See, enlightenment, compassion is root of enlightenment.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Root and both together is cause of enlightenment.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 When you have the compassion, both together comes.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 When you have the both together, then accumulate the variety.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 All the six params come easily.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 And then, enlightenment is just there.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Result is there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 If we have perfect cause and condition, then there is no doubt.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Not achieving the result.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 So this third treasure of the practitioner is compassion.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 All things as much as we can.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Kind of double up.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 It's called very compassion in the heart and mind.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And that is the treasures of the practitioners.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 The fourth treasure is seeing the situation as impermanent.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Always recognizing that impermanent is just here.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 We are all in a roller coaster of impermanent.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Even though we're not detecting that immediately.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 It's impermanent.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So therefore, that reality, all of it,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 just have thought, that thought.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Thought, all of it.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 When you have the understanding, the high light of the empowerment and understanding,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 and that is known as one of the treasures of the practitioners.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 So four treasures.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Four treasures, both with devotion to the lineage.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Second is pure perception.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 All purity, pure perception is genuine of art.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 But pure perception is also real. We purify our observations.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 When we have the cataracts, when we have the jaundice problems,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 we don't see things beautiful, exactly as it is.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 But that is, when we don't see, it's not a problem of the others.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 They're objects.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 It's a problem of our jaundices, our cataracts.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 When we remove the cataracts, we will see the beautiful image, exactly as it is.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 So first of all, we are in the cataracts of the dualities,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 cataracts of the self-importance.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And some kind of "I am I" from things,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 "I am the good ones" and others are all that.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 That notion is so strong.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 This is not just only this time we created, but could pass them.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Within less times, we have that attitude.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Therefore, then even they have, "Oh, everyone is quite good."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 We don't see the good side, good part of that,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 and always highlight the weakness of that.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Weakness. If they have 70% percent, it's okay.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And 20% or 30%, we highlight 30% or higher.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 We ignore the 70% or even 80%.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Or even maybe 95%.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 We think it's not just the Buddha's teaching said or the great religious said.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 We always highlight that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 And if somebody kindly, kindly pointed out,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 "I am making some mistake," then immediately we burst out.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Burst out comes out on a defensive position.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 We don't like to accept that.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Even the really we see in the Ann Arbor 6.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Why? Because the ego.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Ego is so perfect.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Ego is so right.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Everything what I do is quite okay.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Everything others don't do is not okay.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 That perception, we have that.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 That is the cataracts, the dualities.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 So therefore, this really the pure perception, the way to open it, too.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And then particularly in the Vedic Annar teaching,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 when we are practicing together as the one-man dalas

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 and practicing and receiving the teachings

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 and receiving the empowerment,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 those are all in the teaching made that the Vajraya Gauras,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 the Vajraya connected, the Vajraya Bharat and the Sastras,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 that we will accomplish from now on until you need enlightenment.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Always accompany.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Even in the teaching mentioned,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 they will accompany us, like in the bottle lamp.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 In the bottle lamp, there is a lamp

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 and a wick, wick, wick, I think, W-I-C-K.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Wick, wick, and the bottle, the bottle liquid,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 the bottle goes together to illuminate.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And the teaching mentioned that Vajraya Bharat and the Sastras

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 will accompany them all the way to the enlightenment

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 as wick and as liquid bottles.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 That's how the bond is done.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 In the Buddha teaching,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 I've already mentioned, when you read the life story of the Buddha,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 or in the Buddha's teaching,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 all 10 said, "And you have the story of this, the past, this and that,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 and then at the end, you should not take those individuals,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 or else, this is that one, this and this one,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 those all during the life of the Buddhas,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 or this is the Chariputta, this is the Mungaputta,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 or the Kachapa, or the Upali, or the...

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 I mean, all those really make a difference kind of...

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 They make different things happen,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 and the Buddha gives the story,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 and the prayer was a lifetime,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 "This and that, this and that, and now they're this and that."

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 So it's mentioned.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So this is, I think, a long way to go.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 So therefore, as much as we can kind and eyes to each other,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 it's just a wonderful...

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So those are the four triageals,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 that he told the Dhanirum to highlight,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 and it's not just again only his or his Dhanirum,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 but in the teaching mentioned,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 one, we have these four triageals,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 and combined with them, all together,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and then, I think, really, it's just that we're well off,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 and then, when we practice the dholki,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 it will come so perfectly in a beautiful way.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And so that's what gets the kind of food.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Thanks, and now...
