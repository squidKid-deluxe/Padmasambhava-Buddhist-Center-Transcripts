00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Practitioners, if we have the capabilities, courage, commitment, joy of effort, and devotions,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 we can get enlightenment, a core teaching within these lifetimes, which is not eons or eons.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Anyhow, it gets within these lifetimes, highly capabilities, practitioners.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And there are many, many individuals who become enlightened within that lifetime, such as,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 very renowned, such as, J.T. Segevamsa.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 He reached enlightenment in 12 years.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The long chamber also reached enlightenment within his lifetimes, long chambers.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And then all the 25 disciples, such as, Yixin Surya, reached enlightenment within his lifetimes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Those are the examatory that you can reach enlightenment.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 If you have the high cover, you have the courage, commitment, joy of effort, follow the teaching,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 instruction, and apply the teaching, you can get enlightenment within this lifetime.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 Then also, when you apply the teaching, very un-teaching, immediately we visualize ourselves as

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 Buddha,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 not just reading Buddha for a long time.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Instantly we visualize ourselves as Buddhas, such as, Buddha Shatyamuni, Gurbama Sambhava,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 or Veda Kalya, or Veda Varahe, or Veda Yokini.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And we instantly visualize ourselves, and activate that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Reason why, because, again, same thing, same reason, Buddha and we all have the same nature.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 In the natural level, the nature of the mind, or our basic, grown nature level, we are equal.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 There is no difference between Buddha and ourself, according to the teaching.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 We are all the same.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Therefore, we activate our basic qualities, basic nature, instantly.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Instantly, read again how we need, with courage, confidence, and then with meditation.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 We activate that, such as visualization meditation.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 We activate that, and be in that state.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 So, you can get enlightenment within this lifetime.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 Or if you didn't get enlightenment within this lifetime, and the teaching says, you can get

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.000
 enlightenment

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 at the moment of death, or when we leave this bowl.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Or if you saw that didn't happen, and you can get enlightenment in the part of those states.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 Or in the teaching says, those highly culpability practices, I mean those who really need

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.000
 enlightenment,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 they are highly culpability person, but yet they didn't get enlightenment within this lifetime.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 At the moment of death, they can get enlightenment in the Dharmakaya states, Dharmakaya states.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Somehow, we miss that opportunity, we miss that opportunity.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 We can get those individually, minimum culpability, they can get enlightenment in the part of those

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.000
 states,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 in the Sambukaya states, Sambukaya states.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And somehow, in the part of the state, also you really get immediately enlightenment

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 at the end of the, before you rebirth, the next rebirth, those kind of lower culpability practices,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 they can reach enlightenment to the Dharmakaya states.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 So therefore, again, within this lifetime, or the next, soon next lifetime,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 you have high opportunity to get enlightenment.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 For those reasons, it's known as the resolve beyond us.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Immediately activating, capturing, discovering the resolve.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 That is what is called the resolve beyond us.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So, among that, among the resolve beyond us, Jyotin is the highest teaching.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Until Jyotin, according to the teaching, or until the Jyotin teaching,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 all the teachings are basically helping to the, by helping the, by conception to the conceptions.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 By conception to the conceptions, all that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 But Jyotin is beyond the conceptions.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Again, what that means, helping by, of taking care of the, by the conception to the conceptions.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 For such as, the notion of the permanent is taking care of the total, total of the in permanent.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Thought, permanent thought is thought.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 In permanent thought is also thought.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So thought is taking care of thoughts.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And those people who had also long understanding of the cause and effectors,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 and check that is also conservative.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 But then, to check care of that, taking care of teachings on the garments. Cause and effectors.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And the notion of, for example, ego clinging.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 That is taken care of by the thought of the non-ego clinging, or no ego clinging.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Clinging, ego clinging is thought. No ego clinging is thought.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But what is more close to the truth?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 All that in permanent is close to the truth as it is.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.360
 The understanding of the karma is close to the, but not, not believing on the karma, cause and

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.000
 conditions.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And also understanding of the no ego clinging is very true than the clinging on the ego clinging.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It often goes on and on, everything, until the doctor teaching, in the teaching method,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 or the great masters always method, is helping by the conceptual concept.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 But which is also good, according, again, in the school of middle teaching, what is it called?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 The iron is cut by irons.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Orson is cured by the Orson's. It's called, but normally in the Western, homopedics.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Homopedic techniques, which is important, which is very wonderful, good.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.760
 But however, when you're looking from the looking point, its conception is taking care of the

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.000
 conceptions.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 But zokin is beyond the conceptions.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Immediately we are connected to the origin and nature as it is, beyond the conceptions.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 So therefore, what always in the doctor teaching or the great doctor master said,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.760
 zokin is the practice or teaching of the beyond the conception of, zokin is the teaching of the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.000
 primordial states,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 clear like the minister states. Therefore, zokin is very fast.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Zokin is about, there is nothing higher, no higher than zokin teaching at all in Buddhism.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 There is no higher zokin, more profound, more direct to discover our enlightenment.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.990
 All Buddha teaching is design and teaching on how to discover our inner nature or become Buddha

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.000
 Buddha.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Buddha, that's the goal.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And zokin is the most powerful, direct teaching to discover this teaching.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 So that's why a little bit is called, simlinde bhiji.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Zokin is a wisdom which is beyond conception or beyond thought.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 That is immediately engaged there.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 So that way, therefore, zokin is highest in tantras.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 In a tantra level, when a tantra is divided, six different tantras or four different tantras.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Four tantras, three outer tantra, kriya tantra, popa tantra, yoga tantras.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Those are the four tantras.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Fourth one is known as supreme yoga tantra.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Supreme yoga tantra, that's the four divisions.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And this fourth supreme yoga tantra, then there is many terminologies or two leading terminologies,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 which is known as sometimes named as supreme yoga tantra, divided into three.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And those are known as two terminologies, pada tantra, mada tantra, and neutral tantras.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.360
 In the Dokji teaching, there are numerous schools which are based in Buddhism, always named Mahay

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.000
oga Tantra, Anuyoga Tantra, and Adiyoga Tantras.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.070
 Adiyoga Tantra is the similar equal willingness of the neutral tantras, in other words, neutral

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.000
 tantras.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Neutral tantra is the most powerful direct teaching as I mentioned, according to the teaching,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 according to the greatest masters.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Therefore, Dokji is the highest teaching.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And as we are dividing in Dokji teaching, or not as we divide, and that is what Dokji teaching.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 When you practice it, there is a tochoo and a toga practice, within two practices, tochoo practice,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 toga practice.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Tochoo practice is the equal willingness of a visitor of Mahamudrati, very similar.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Mahamudrati, even though, again, there are slightly some distinctions in a great master's measure.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Because, again, Dokjin is directly going to the wisdom, promote your wisdom.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 But Dokka teaching is the extraordinary teachings of the Dokjins.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.310
 There is nothing any other teaching mentioned clearly, so profoundly, so detailed, and so direct of

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.000
 the toga teachings.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 One is that, again, one is just those teachings.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 I have a simple way to put tochoo practices of the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And Dokka teaching is a clarity aspect of the enlightened quality of the nature of the mind.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 That explains.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.500
 And the Unite both together, then makes it so powerful to discover the ultimate quality of the

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.000
 nature of the mind, as it has, as this mind has.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So that is generally kind of understanding of the Tao, the way they are teaching, or the Dokkati.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Now, today, we go on, again, this S Dokkins has already made Dokki.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Dokki, and now, once we have this,
