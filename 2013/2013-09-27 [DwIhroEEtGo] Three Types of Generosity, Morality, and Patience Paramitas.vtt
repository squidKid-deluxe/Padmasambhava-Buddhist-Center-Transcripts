00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 The great master mentioned one after another, but then now he highlighted again six paramitas and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:20.410
 that is generosity as well as morality, patience practices, and concentrations, joyful efforts,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.580
 concentrations, and as well as the worship paramitas.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 So yesterday we went briefly of all the generously that he highlighted and as well as the moral

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.920
ities that we went through.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 Moralities such as taking as what called that at vows, or the Bhaskar vows or the uni vows as like

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.680
 in a vows, the one 24-hour day vows you take. Those are related with the moralities.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.000
 Again, as I said, when we keep the morality as morality paramata, concept and morality practices

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.680
 beautifully, and then again standing firmly above heart in both each other.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.940
 And that is what again morality can be divided. The other six paramita can be divided into, each of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.680
 them divided into three, three, three, three, and all messy 18 divisions.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.370
 And furthermore can be divided, then paramitas, each paramita can be divided into six, six

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.680
 divisions.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:43.750
 So that means, each paramita actually can contain the all six paramitas as like what in Russia they

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.680
 have, special those. What's called?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 Those that looks like outside one, but inside it has all different things, layer of layer that.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 That is how beautiful it is. Each of these really rich, rich.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.430
 And I think, I always talk again once to remind it to you. To remind you that this 18 paramita can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.680
 be divided into three.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 I already said you three of the generalists. Again, maybe I will talk that one more time.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.920
 Material generalists and as well as your production generalists, and then the expert or the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.580
 knowledge generalist, and also this is known as the generalist of the teachings or the Danas or the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 world of Muslims.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:52.680
 Those are the generalists. Morality can be divided into again a three. Those three are false ways.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 The morality that while preventing all the negative actions, that is the post.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.910
 Morality that will stop all the negative actions, all the happy dependence, the bad happy

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.680
 dependence that is disturbing ourself and others, or annoying to others.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 That's stopping. That is known as the need of morality that's stopping all the negative activities.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 Second morality is known as gathering all the virtues, all the good things that you gathered.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.870
 You are developing. That means you're developing, you're strengthening, you're understanding. Keep

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.680
 up that goodness. That's the second morality.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 Third morality is known as performing the activity that benefiting to the others, to the other

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.680
 beings that you do the activity.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.220
 Anything that you can do happens to others. In the context of our game, both each other, that means

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.680
 when we do these practices, it's totally love, it's compassion, it's wisdom, it's intelligence.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.740
 It's not just a dummy, stupid, or any of what they call, any of activities, but something so

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.680
 enlightened activities and beautiful.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.680
 That is known as the moralities. Those are the divisions of the moralities.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 And the third is the patience.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.280
 Patient practices, again, there can be, again, patient standing firmly on the ground of the body jh

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.680
ata, and then we perform the activities of the patient.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:56.720
 The patient can be divided again into three pieces. Those are known as the first pieces, and the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.680
 first is the patient or the patient that I never mind distributing to the others.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.150
 So the patient that I don't care, for example, I don't care if it is bothering me, or they annoy me

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.680
, I don't care.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.520
 Kind of that attitude. So in a way, if I roughly translate it, the patient of the never mind. Never

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.680
 mind.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 Never mind, patients. Never mind. I don't care. I'm going to stay.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.680
 Strong, I'm not going to chase up there. So that is the never mind, the patient, those two.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 And the second thing is accepting the heart share and the difficulties.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 Heart share and the difficulties. Joyfully courageous.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 In life, as we have difficulty in troubles and challenges, that is true.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 No one is out of that. No one is exceptionally in some sense.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 The moment we are born in this universe, in the earth, we always have difficulty in challenges.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 It's part of the game, part of the show of our lives.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:19.680
 But, however, with that happened, that again, the great courage and confidence and passion,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 so this accepting whatever the situation comes, strongly and very courageously.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 Courageous. That is known as second passion. Patient accepting the heart share. Joyfulness.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:46.680
 And third passion, third passion is patience of not scared with anything,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:55.680
 is not scared with mysteries, or not scared with the profound meaning of the views.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 For our understanding, this personal moment, our understanding is limited.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.680
 But we should not stay with that limitation.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 We have to open the door of our knowledge intelligently, widely, to see every panoramic.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.680
 For example, this time, in the modern science, how much they discover, one after another.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 How many they discover, voyages are moving forward and adventures, through that exploration.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680
 One after another happens.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 So our knowledge in the wisdom is not like knowledge was known about 200 years ago.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.680
 The public has knowledge in the wisdom. It's experience.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 There are so many mysteries, so many things to discover, we shouldn't block our knowledge.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.680
 And when we have to know something, when we heard that, we should not be scared with that.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.680
 We should not be scared with that.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.680
 At the same time, to keep up our goodness, such as practice,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.880
 and we should not be terminated by the difficult heart shapes of the practices, and doing good

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.680
 things.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.680
 So those are the third division of the patients.
