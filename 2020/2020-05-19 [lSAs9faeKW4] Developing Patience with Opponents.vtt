00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Thank you, everyone, again. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. And again, thank you for participating

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 and coming, making time. Thank you very much, everyone. Now again, we continue to follow

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 what we're talking, or what I'm talking. We continue to follow it. There's the teachings

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 on the particular course. It's about the video of this teaching, as gracious teachers,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni talk. So, they're all going. And so, again, in order to follow the teaching,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 always in the teaching set, so reactivate our motivation. And that means, among all the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 motivations, we're going to activate our beautiful motivation of the joy and the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 appreciations. And we're going to be such a graceful, gratitude, thankful. All those

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 really beautiful motivation are so important. Those are the heart and essence of the Dharma

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 that we'll be practicing. That was the teaching of the gracious teachers, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Along with that was the motivation of the body temple. And it really understands

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 the realization of the very other teachings. Every time, according to the lineage teaching,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 reminding that every time you remind this, it's not just once in a while we reflect

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 those motivations. We do motivations. When we wake up in the morning, we feel thankful,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 grateful. Exactly what I'm talking about, that's what a gracious teacher, Buddha

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Shakyamuni talk. Thankful, grateful, gratitude, joy and appreciation. Beautiful life is here,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 right with us. I'm going to make something beautiful, to benefit myself and to benefit

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 for all living beings. Actually, we embody self-practice and thinking more other than

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 ourselves. So, why? Because how many of these are such a precious, beautiful opportunity,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 beautiful life, that I'm going to really make something good, beautiful contributions

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 for all living beings. Really, and I'm going to do that, please, blessed by all the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 body, the bodhisattva. May I affirm that goal. We think that sincerely from the heart

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 and joy. And with that, in life today, bodhisattva, vastness, motivation of the bodhisattva

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 and beauty realization, the way he has teachings, this is so important. In the teachings,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 if you can mind, kind of bring up those beautiful attitude and beautiful thought as many as

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 you can do in the evening today, it's great. Of course, particularly when you practice

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 the meditating and you're reflecting on the teachings, definitely, you're reflecting.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 The sole purpose of our practices is really we decide it, and that's what we said in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 front of all bodhisattva to benefit for all living beings by our competence. So therefore,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 kind of activating that as much as that is known as practicing, that is known as exercise

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 of the body to others. So therefore, again, we reflect those beautiful motivations toward

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 each other. And then we go on the teachings now, what we discussed. And yesterday, I went

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 a little bit of overview of what we've been discussing since we started our healing retreats

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 a little bit, and then I said about the bodhisattvas. And so, in the bodhisattva is exactly that,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 in the bodhisattva has two bodhisattvas, and we think bodhisattva and actualizing bodhisattva.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So we went through those all quite detailed, and of course, there's more to be said.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 This is the profound teachings. Entirely generated bodhisattva is the best on the bodhisattva,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 particularly Mahayana and Vayayana teaching is totally best on the bodhisattva. That is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 so profound. That means included zobki teachings, that is all. So we went through that.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And then bodhisattva, we have the wishing bodhisattva, and we have the rebel of the very beautiful

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 motivation of wishing bodhisattva, sincerely in our heart and mind, then we begin to actualize

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 in the bodhisattva. And therefore, the frame of the wind comes to actualize the bodhisattva.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Yesterday, I think we are for good. For good that actualizing bodhisattva, we put in these

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 three frames, follow the instructions of the great mask unkimvas, those three nobles, three

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 nobles, beginning noble, middle noble, and concluding nobles, those. And the beginning

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 noble is again motivation, is nothing any different than beautiful motivation, joy, and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 appreciation, bodhisattva. And then you really understand or realize any devotions. Devotion

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 is so important in the beginning, beginning time, and that is foundation. So that means

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 what? According to the teaching, the Buddha, the beginning noble, the first noble, is the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 poor, renormalization of thought, then refuge, bodhisattva, and purity realization, and devotions.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 That is the foundation. That is foundation of the practice, which is known as the beginning

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 nobles. With that beautiful foundation, then we begin noble, middle noble, sorry, middle

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 noble. Middle noble, beginning noble, middle noble, as principle. Middle noble as frame,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 actualizing the bodhisattva, actualizing the bodhisattva. And those are what is actualizing

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 the body. That is summarized by the direction of the teacher Buddha Chaitanya Muni in the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 six Aramatha practices. That can be summarized into three practices, principle practices.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Those are the three extra ordinary practices, extra ordinary practices. Those are three

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 trainings sometimes. And morality, concentration, and the wisdom. And we expand it a little

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 bit then, that is the six Aramathas. Six Aramatha is actually encompassed the entire practice

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 of the Buddha Dhamma when it comes to practices. Particularly it is highlighted and very kind

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 of intensified in the Mahayana teachings to activate both each other, both each other.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Bodhisattva is, of course, Sanskrit Bodhi. We all know that. We all know and we all know

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 that. Bodhi means what? Enlightenment. Enlightenment. Enlightenment is our goal. Our foundation

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 too. Enlightenment is our Buddha nature. Your nature, my nature. That we have to revere.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 We have to revere. In that way, it is our goal to revere. How to revere? With the mind,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 the determined mind, enlightened mind. That is what we are going to do. In order to do

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 that, we take up Bodhisattva vows. We take the Bodhisattva vows, what we call, of course

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 we all know, we all know that. When we talk about Bodhisattva vows, it is called Bodhisattva.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Bodhisattva, right? What means Bodhisattva? Again, Bodhi is enlightenment. Sattva means

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 courageous. That means mind, courageous mind. We are going to revere, achieve our basic goodness,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 our goal, ultimate goal, with courage, with commitment, with confidence. That we become

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 the courageous ones. Once we become the Bodhisattva, generally we are all known as Bodhisattvas.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 And sometimes it is named in the Buddha teaching, noble son, noble daughters. What means noble

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 son and noble daughter? We are noble. We are activating our enlightenment nature. Our own

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 basic goodness, that nature. Therefore, we are novels. What means son and daughters?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 That means we become the children of the Buddha, children of the warriors, children of the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 bravery clients, the courageous clients, not the timid, not the wicked ones, courageous

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 clients. What kind of courage? Courage for enlightenment. For enlightenment, our enlightenment,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 for also enlightenment, for all the beings. We are going to be courageous ones. Therefore,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 it is called Bodhisattvas. So if we translate it into English, maybe the warriors of the

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 enlightenment. So in the moment we talk about Bodhisattva, we become, we are belongs to

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 the club, if I say, club of the enlightened warrior clubs. We are truly born. We are going

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 to revere. To revere our nature, to help to revere the nature of others' enlightenment,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 that needs courage, that needs commitment. What is the most dangerous obstacle to prevent

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 our enlightenment? It is the negatives, the emotions, the obscurations. That is the most

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 dangerous obstacle, hindrance, and enemies of the enlightenment. We are going to defeat

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 them. Therefore, it is called warriors. Every defeated warriors of this, every defeated

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 negative emotion, or the emotion enemies, or these negative enemies, that is known as

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 in the Buddha teaching, the great warriors. That is really, really dangerous. In the samsara

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 what they say, the warrior killed, he or she killed something, this and that things, or

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 defeated, that is what great master, Shanti Devas, he is just almost like killing, killing

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 the, the already killed. You name it, already something is killed, and the going to kill,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 are killed. Anyways, anything will be all going to die, never going to stay forever.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 So what the reason? That is to claim you end with the environment. But the defeat of these,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 the worst enemy of all the time is the negative emotions. That one who are going to defeat

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 them, they are the warriors, the bodhisattvas. So this is when we take the bodhisattva, the

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 other vowels, you become the bodhisattva, you will become really the warriors of this.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And what kind of tools we are going to use to defeat this negative, what kind of weapons

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 we are going to use to defeat the negative emotions. These negative enemies, these powerful

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 enemies, that is six warrior mothers. The six warrior mothers is our weapons, weapons.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Six warrior mothers is our means to defeat the most powerful obstacles, the most powerful

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 enemies, the most luminously enemies in our lifetimes. That is really going to defeat

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 these six warrior mothers. So therefore, it's called courageous ones. And that is, again,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 then with actualizing bodhisattva. And that is the actualizing bodhisattva is, as I said,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 start with the three novels, beginner novel, middle novel, and when it comes to the middle

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 novel, and then that's what practice, really how we are going to practice, that's what

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 in the teaching says, middle novel, middle novel is without an attachment in the graspments.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Practice, without an attachment, that means so much grasping and clinging. We are going

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 to practice more calm, more peaceful, more relaxed, more openness heart. That is what

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 we are going to defeat, this powerful, luminously, our obstacles of these negative emotions. And

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 for that is then to do this continually, those six warrior mothers. And now we went really

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 above all these six warrior mothers, sorry, six warrior mothers, you all know six warrior

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 mothers, and this is, again, what's called this name, six warrior mothers in the generous

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 warrior mother. And now each of those warrior mothers, what is really the generous warrior

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 mother? I said already before, and if you remember, and many of course you all know

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 these things, the essence, nature of the generous warrior mother is sharing, giving thought,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 going to keep to the others, I'm going to keep, going to keep, how I'm going to keep,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 going to keep without any expectations, going to keep that. The giving attitude, that is

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 then, that nature of the generous, what we are going to keep, we are going to give a

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 great mass, Shati Deva said, giving them our material, our wealth, our material wealth,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 our body, our marriage worries, that I'm going to share. So that means whatever you hold,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I'm going to share, I'm going to keep, not just share more than sharing, going to keep,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 that is going to keep. Whatever tools, skills, methods, materials, marriage worries,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 whatever, reputations, glories, whatever, I'm going to give them to the others. That

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 is, and the essence of this generosity is, as I said, is then the giving, and that means

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 no clinging, antidote of the miserous, or clinging on the miserous, or attachment,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 that is. Then, the nature of the morality, that will be discussed, nature of morality

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 is the mental attitude to stay clean, and I'm going to stay clean. That determination,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 why are you going to stay clean? Because of compassion, loving kindness, that I'm going

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 to help for all the centipedes, therefore I like to stay clean, clean, clean in beauties,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 stainless, stainless I like to stay. And then that morality, that is nature, and morality

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 is divided into three, right? And the morality, that will be avoiding all the negativities,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 indirectly, small, medium, or the big. That means all the negativities, stains, going

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 to clean well. I'm never allowed to let it come close to me. I'm going to go with my

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 mind on the list, and never going to let me let down, fall down, again on the ditch.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 I'm going to stay clean. That attitude, that thought, is the nature of the morality.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 With that, I'm going to glorify, not just survive in situations, but I'm going to

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 glorify that. How to do? Gathering all the virtues, good things, to glorify that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Every tools to glorify my clean, to remain in purity, I'm going to gather. All the

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 virtues, directly, indirectly, whether it's big, whether it's small, whether it's

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 medium, I'm going to gather. All that. That is known as the morality of the gathering,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 all the virtues. Third one we discussed, and benefited, morality that benefited for

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 all the sentient beings. That also means what? Actually, expanding your goodness,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 goodness, expanding our beautiful purity status, purity status, to all the beings

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 that benefited that. Therefore, this morality, as I said many times, it encompasses

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 the entire teaching of the Buddha. All the teachings, really practice all that

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 gathering. Again, to become the Buddha, or to reach the realization, to become the

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Buddha Buddha, or enlightenment mind, or enlightenment, is called the perfect status.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Buddha are the perfect status. Perfect purification, perfect achievement,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 perfect benefiting, happen. So this morality is a foundation of that. Morality

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 that will purify all the negative reading is the way to bring our self perfect

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 purifications, total cleanness, clean, pure, completely gone, the stain of that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 There is no stain, no shadow. It's gone, and that is the Buddha's book.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 What did the teaching say? It's individable, bomb, and so on. Perfect clean, perfect

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 clean. That is this morality. That's how it started this. And then, with that,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 and perfect gathering, perfect all the witches are gathering, every good things

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 are all gathering, and that brings perfect realization, understanding, perfect

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 realization, and understanding. So the Buddha hold is the perfect realization status.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Buddha is perfect. Buddhas are perfect. Whether male Buddha or female Buddhas are

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 perfect, because there, the courageous work put enlightenment for a long time.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Therefore, they have even no stains of the naked witches, or the stains.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 And I gather all the witches, everything perfect. Therefore, it's not perfect.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Realization is complete. These first three are generally in the Buddha teaching

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 as well. This perfect purification, perfect achievement is known as one's

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 own achievement. One's own achievement. What that means in the Buddha teaching,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 often we heard, when you're making enlightenment, you've fulfilled two purposes.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 One's own purpose and purpose for others. Purification and achievement is one's

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 own purpose. Now, your goal is complete, or our goal is completed. There's nothing

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 we have to gather more. It's everything completed. That is perfect achievement

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 of one's own purposes. When we started benefiting to the other beings,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 it's called the benefit or purpose of the benefit or purpose of all other things.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 It's the purpose of others. That benefit and purpose is started from the way

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 we are practicing Dharma. Practicing both in soccer, we practice, but then

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 personally, we achieve that when we become the Buddha Buddha accordingly.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 So, once when all the purpose is achieved, what is called known as, we achieve

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Dharmakaya status. Dharmakaya status.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 When we start to benefit for all sentient beings through your completion,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 continually, that is known as Rupakaya. As we discussed the other day, or yesterday,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and of course, you all know Rupakaya. This is the one benefiting for the sentient

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 beings. When you perfect that, that is then Rupakaya status.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Rupakaya status, then benefit of all sentient beings by two Gaias, Sambokaya

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 and then Mount Gaias. All the sentient beings until that enlightenment.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Everyone is reaching enlightenment. Also, we discussed earlier, when we discussed

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 about the Buddha, Gaias, and all those of that. So, that is what is really

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 about the generally this morality. So, now, once the morality is, next one

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 is what? Have you talked that? According to the order, first the generosity

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 and the second is the morality and the third is then patience parameters.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Now, the patience parameter is. The patience parameter is, again, I talked

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 really about this, the world meaning, nature of the patient parameter

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 and as well as division of the parameters. And the world meaning of the parameter

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 and then benefit of the parameter, sorry, the patient parameter, so world meaning

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 of the patient parameter and benefit of the patient parameters and division

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 of the patient parameters. Those are our thoughts. And the fourth one is

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 the world meaning. Patient, in Sanskrit word, is known as chanting parameter.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Chanting parameter, as we discussed earlier in your whole talk, means one lead

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 to the other shows. That means the other show is what the other show is.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Show of the beyond samsara and the nirvana in the teaching set.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Not show of the samsara, when you practice the really parameter,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 it will lead you to the beyond the show. Show, beyond the show of samsara,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 beyond the show of nirvanas. That's what they lead in the teaching set.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 What that actually means, the show of samsara, that maybe we understand

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 what that means, beyond the show of samsara. That we understand.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 But what means beyond the show of nirvanas? Then this parameter is normally

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 in the show of the nirvana, such as arahadahud. That's what they indicated

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 in the Mahayana teachings or great, weak teachings. Mahayana, sorry,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 the island of hope is great achievement, great realization.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 But according to the teaching, it is, in a way, safe, hearing for one's own self.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Safe, hearing for one's own self.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 For what? From safe, for what? From the miserable, difficulty, troubles of samsara.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 So you now don't have any troubles of samsara. You are safe, hearing.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Safe, hearing. And that is just a very general, roughly, ideas of these nirvanas.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 And that generally is what? Beyond of any nirvana, which is arahadahud,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 again, the nirvana of arahadahud is beyond any consumption and any feelings.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And all the naked videos of the emotion obscuration are gone.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 So therefore, you don't have to be come back or pulsed back by the dharma in the samsara

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 because there is no cause. What that cause? Cause of suffering truth is eliminated.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Cause of suffering truth is gone. Therefore, we are not going back to the samsara.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 So it's a safe, hearing. In a safe, safe, hearing for one's own, in a way, individual.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 It didn't mean that arahadahs don't have compassion.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Entire teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni is best upon the compassion and non-violence

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 and poor-bornness in the way.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 But there is like ex-conductor of this, according to the teaching.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 The Bodhisattvaayana is not on that. Stay in the safe, hearing of one's own achievements

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 but benefit for all the living beings.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Even if we are talking about when we reach the Buddha world, you have got two purposes.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 You prefer the two purposes. The purpose of one's own self, the purpose of others,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 or the goal of one's own self and the goal of others that you are going to have to prefer.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 The goal, you prefer the goal of your own self by becoming or achieving the Buddha world.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 But that didn't really prefer the complete goal to benefit for all the sentient beings.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 To benefit the two sentient beings is then you are going to emanate into guys.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Samokaya, Nirmakaya are going to benefit.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Then you are continually fulfilling the purpose, goal of others.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 So that is the goal of the Mahayana or the Buddha world.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 That is the one we are talking about here, the Paramata.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 These Paramata practices will tell us beyond show, beyond the show of samsara and nirvana.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 For those reasons, what did the teaching say?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Beyond subject and object and activities.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Beyond any grassroots, not looking for the same heavens.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Not looking for the same one's own something like this.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 But beyond, that is really the meaning of the Paramatas.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 So if that is the meaning of all the Paramatas, then of course you can look more in the teaching.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.800
 There are so many details of this all. You can look on the teachings and even the most simple way

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.000
 to find out is that you can look in the Googles too.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 This is all is in the internet now, I think, really.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 So extensively you can look and find out exactly precisely that.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 But what I am talking is just highlight of the glimpse of this meaning so that we can understand

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 something that we can move forward.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.040
 And of course you already know I am not talking something that you don't know and I am just talking

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.000
 these times.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Sorry, making those kind of statements.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 But that is what I may call it the teaching said, so I am just really saying that.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 So that is chandhi now. Chandhi means what?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 It means patient. That is really patient.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 So patient Paramatas. Patient.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:27.330
 And that, what is now, patient, meanwhile, patient of all the troubles, difficulties, challenges of

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.000
 the samsara.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And as well, difficulty, challenges of all the enlightened or caring on the Paramatas.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.480
 Not just only chant Paramatas, but caring on the generous Paramatas, caring on the patient Paramat

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.000
as,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 caring on your effort Paramatas, concentrated Paramatas and western Paramatas, caring on that.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 This Paramatas is not just simple things.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 It is long last go, deep and vast and profound and more powerful.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 To handle that, that is really tough.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 This is, therefore, patient Paramatas is a tough focus. It is tough.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 It is really, to you, it is tough.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Therefore, it is called patient.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Be patient. That also indicates not timid.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Not timid, not weak, not feeble, not so sensitive, prejudiced.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.430
 Project, not much, much malice, much, it is tough, strong, disturbance, courage, confidence,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.000
 commitment.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Really, that is what Paramatas, this chant Paramatas.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.310
 And the most challenging of the, immediately facing challenges of the chant Paramata, or the

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.000
 patient Paramata,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 is that among the all negative, is anger.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 That is the most powerful anger.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 So, we are standing tall and faint with anger, emotions.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 For that reason, the nature of this Paramata, patient Paramata, is never mind, or not disturbed.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Not disturbed is the nature of the chant Paramata, or the patient Paramatas.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 How? Not disturbed. Your courage, your commitment, your confidence, your attitude, your openness,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 and attitude of never mind.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 As standing firm and strong.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 So, then never letting go.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Anger, not erupted, and become the entities of our generation, our Paramatas practices.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So that is really what the patient generates.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Now, this patient is, this, again, it has patient, each, each poor, sick Paramata has poor benefits

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000
.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 As I mentioned earlier, you may remember, and of course, many of you already know that,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 but those Paramatas, generous Paramatas have poor benefits.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And morality Paramata has poor benefits, and chant Paramata has poor benefits.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:45.430
 And the first one, benefit of each of those, is immediately stopping the opposite of those sick

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.000
 Paramatas.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Immediately, it will play a way, the opposite of those sick Paramatas.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.580
 And the opposite of those sick Paramatas, again, it's like just to break free of you, if you don't

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.000
 remember,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 and to tell that again. What is opposite of generosity?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Misery, strangeness. So when we do the generosity, it immediately clear with, clear with that

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 obstacle of the Misery,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 and all strangeness. That is, whether it's big, whether it's small, it holds our capabilities.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:39.030
 When we have the morality Paramata, it immediately stops the demorality, I think, or immorality,

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.000
 that will stop.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.710
 So it's opposite, it's immediately, it is stopping. So that is big, one of the big benefits

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.000
 immediately.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 And patient Paramata is, immediately it will stop.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 What? Timidity. It will claim it, oh, maybe anger, woke up, that anger, that will stop.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And then, joyful effort Paramatas. When we have joyful effort Paramata, immediately it will stop.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 That lady in this, lady in this, that will be stopped.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And then, when we have the concentrate Paramata, what will it stop?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 It will stop the destructions of the mind. It will stop that.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 When we have the version of Paramata, it will stop the ignorance, or dullness.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Or it will bring more mindfulness. Mind, it will stop the mindlessness, or whatever.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 That is, really it will stop. So those are immediately the benefit of this.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Immediately of those, each Paramata. And then, additionally each of those has three.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Three, three, three. So therefore, each of those four, four, four.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 So suppose, now the patient Paramata, we now need the patient Paramata.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 So patient Paramata, having my patient Paramata, it will circumvent the timidity,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 or it will stop the anger, erupting the anger, it will stop.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And that immediately, what will do?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And the second is, it will fulfill our wishes.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 It will fulfill our wishes. And the second, it will...

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Second, third, and all are very similar to everyone, every one of us, similar.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 The fourth one is that, I already said, it will stop the anger, or the timidity.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 And the second benefit of the child's patient Paramata is fully our wishes.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 And then third Paramata, the third benefit of this patient Paramata,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 it will bring realization of the emptiness. Emptiness, realization of the emptiness,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 or it will bring the nature of the emptiness realization.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 And the fourth benefit of this patient Paramata, it will benefit to the others,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 according to their designated wishes, such as according to Buddhism,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 the wishes of the traditional realization of the another hood,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 particular Buddha hood, or bodhisattva hood, or the Buddha hood.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 So it will connect to them. Since we are Buddhist practitioners,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 since we are bodhicitta practitioners and practicing sixth Paramata,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 so also when you do the patient practices,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 you are engaging within the frame of the Buddha teaching,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 so then it will inspire others according to their designated wishes,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 or their connected wishes or yanas,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 such as particular yana, and ahapayana, and bodhisattva yanas.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 So those are four benefits of the patient practices.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Now the division of these Paramatas is then known as, it has three.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Again, each of those Paramatas are divided into three.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 A chant Paramata is, now patient Paramata, is divided into three.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 And which is, both is, is the patient Paramata of standing firmly with the opponents,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 all obstacles, standing firmly with the obstacles.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 And the second patient practices is accepting all the difficulty tunnels, challenges.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 That is the second.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And the third patient practices is, and having, again, patient to achievement of the realizations,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 achievement of realizations, so patient for the realizations, realizations.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 So among that is post.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Post is, patient is, patient for the chat, the opponents, or the obstacles, or the challenges.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 So that is really the, is the post.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 And this again, in samsara, there is so many difficulties and troubles.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 And this is like, again, the most enemy is our negatives.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Negatives are such as five poses.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 All those are known as ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, and arrogance.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 Then there is additional, again, a bit doubt, hesitations, those, all the obstacles.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 This is the really big obstacles.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Among that, what is the pronoun of the obstacles?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 The ignorance is behind everything.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 But pronoun of the obstacles, what comes from on the surface is attachment, the anger, jealousness,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 and arrogance, then doubts.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 And all that is best on the ego clings.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 So ego clinging, ignorance are the fundamental foundations of all that, and those other emotional

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 tools

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 that is making all that count as obstacles.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Among that, which will erupt or become the big disturbance of the patient is anger.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Anger is the most powerful disturbance in the samsara.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 It's really the world, it's very accurate.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 In the teaching, what they say today, there is no, the obscurations are bigger than the anger.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 There is no obscuration bigger than anger.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Or there is no, no bigger karma, bad karma than the anger.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And therefore, there is no bigger practice than the patient.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Patient is the most powerful practices to defeat anger.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Why is anger so bad? Because it disturbs.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Anger, where is it coming from? It's from ignorance, from ego clinging.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Where is those ego clinging, ignorance? It's emptiness.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 It's arising from the emptiness as it already comes, or tornadoes.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 When it hits, it's devastating. It's devastating the countries, it's devastating cities,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 it's devastating on the towns, villages, and family lives than individuals.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 That is, this is really, anger is so big disturbance.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.710
 This is not just a Buddha saying, a teaching said, or a great mother saying, it's been seen in the

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.000
 world.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 So many of these troubles that happen in the world.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 But most of the time, they're called mainland troubles.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 But it's many times the best upon the anger.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.980
 Now, whatever it is, whether it's best, whatever they believe, whatever they thought, it is big

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.000
 disturbance.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 That is what comes from the anger.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 So therefore, anger is really just a destroy of everything.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Even you have beautiful house, beautiful life, beautiful family, beautiful whole lives,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.200
 you reach, and luckily say everything, but then anger completely knocked down all that glorious and

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.000
 beautiful.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 This is what is known as the odd anger.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 But according to the teaching, that is not the end, the suffering.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.110
 It created the heavy calmness, created bad, bad, the negative scars, or stains, and registered in

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.000
 the subconscious, the stolen house,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 or subconsciousness, mental space, storage of the iCloud, of the mental spaces.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 It's stolen, completely dead.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 And then it again, murder flies, that is known as the calmness.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 So therefore, patience is the most, yeah, patience is really the most powerful practice.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 In the teaching, he said, even your practice is generally so well, so beautiful.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Even your practice is so powerful and beautiful, but every anger erupted.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 It traverses.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 That all marriage is gone.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Marriage is destroying. The friendship is destroying. Harmony is destroying.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 The everything is really destroyed.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 That is what the anger is.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 For that reason, thinking so strongly, beautiful openly, widely, and really,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.100
 so strongly thinking now and thinking future to everyone during the practice is one of the so

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.000
 special practices, powerful practices.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 That's what the teaching said, all that.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 I mean, there's beautiful, those stories that you can read in the books, and all that.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 It's so, it's not a good story.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Those are really, they did these great master's practices, they did these practices.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 I mean, they are so special, and so beautiful.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 And so now I'm going to stop here, and we continue to read.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 It's time, and thank you so much everyone who gave you for your patience,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 and for really patience of listening my broken English.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 English, whoever here, and then as well as for participating of your time.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Three years of your participating time, which is gedelustis.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 That is really gedelustis practices.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 And the kind of keeping that in witchy language, these are the moralities.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Keeping up on the time and schedule, those are known as moralities.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 I'm not joking. Those are really, the teaching said, the time.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 And then you create a kind of beautiful atmosphere, calm and relaxing,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 and the following the teaching, or at least repress something of your memory.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Those all is moralities.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 And then also difficulty troubles, this is what's talking, this and that.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Trying to figure out, but not kind of hold and give up immediately.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 And that is patience, patience practice.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 So you have, we all practice patience.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 You really practice patience, of course your body is afterwards,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 and you are doing your duty, and I thank you.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Now with the short meditation, and then...
