00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 And again, of course, it continues many times. It mentioned that, of course, you have the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.880
 opportunity

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.160
 to set up a beautiful shrine, nice in your area, and then go in your home and nice location

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.760
 and do set up a shrine. Because shrine, generally, what represents is our devotion, our joy, our

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.240
 appreciation, our practice. And that is what really this shrine represents. It's beautiful.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.640
 Nice shrine, nice â€” F is common in this video, family members, and as well as your friend,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 and F net is okay. Nice shrine, something nice, appealing, beautiful looking, beautiful display,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.080
 kind of follow with the according instructions or the lineage instruction. But at the same time,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 nice, kind of that, appealing, in the center of that, and then for the Buddha,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.360
 God of Emma, Sambo, Thara, and then book your white umbrella, or other your

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.640
 optical veneration, so you put up that. And then also nice, that cheap, kind of clean and elite,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 as you can every day. Those are important. And then we began to practice, and as you all know,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 do walk through both statues, again, through the shrine, three-four stations, and then sit down

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 uncomfortably on the cushion, passing to the shrine. And then start with the practices.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.160
 Ever so is not common is to set up the shrine by your friend or the family member, then again,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.480
 don't have to concern that. Because, as I said, shrine is a symbol of our joy, appreciation,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.570
 and the devotion, that is. But the really shrine is in our heart, heart. That is the most important

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.720
,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.240
 and that is again, joy, devotion, closeness, feeling to the Buddha down in the Sangha,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 and in Gharapayam, Sambo, strongly kind of unfailing devotion and joy and appreciation.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.720
 That is the absolute shrine, and ignite that collect, and feel joy and appreciation, and so on.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.520
 And then, if again, common is, do three-four stations, not sit comfortably wherever that is,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.520
 is in the corner of the room or the other, so on, and then begin to practice. And begin to practice

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.800
 again with this. Then, first this, start with the, our opening prayers, lineage prayers,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.920
 seven-line prayers, and lineage prayers, those prayers. But when you join this, feel the presence

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.760
 of the Gharapayam, Sambo, right in front of sky, sky, strongly, Gharapayam, Sambo, verbatim, verbat

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.800
im,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.560
 verbatim, as transcendental, Visto-renbo-boarding of loving kindness and compassion, as bladed as

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.800
 the sunlight, like billions of the sunlight come to that as one single state, as that kind of power

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.320
 of love and compassion, Visto. And surrounded by the Gharapayam, Sambo, all the lineage masters,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.800
 and then white umbrellas, and so forth, all that did, just see that everything, and feel great joy

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.440
 and appreciation. As I said, the practice means practicing joy, practicing appreciation,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.760
 practicing devotion, and practicing six paramatyas, and the passion, the tolerance,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.960
 and porgi, and all those beautiful things. That is what really will mean, practices,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.290
 practice. That practice, we're not going to live on the cushion, but with that practice, we're

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.240
 going to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.040
 carry with our world, wherever we go, we're going to keep that practice. That is known as the,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.640
 the really practitioners, practically. So therefore, again, we're all practicing, but sometimes,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.200
 many times, we kind of practice it, live in the room or cushion, and then kind of forget

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.360
 when we deal with the family member, or with the world, that we miss those things. So therefore,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.760
 indeed, those qualities are so important. And now, back with our practices. So,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.120
 set on the cushion with great joy and appreciation, and feel this, one of the beautiful moments,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.480
 and beautiful things, that I'm glorified, my beautiful natures, is so spread. I'm going to

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.760
 benefit to myself, and going to benefit to the others. I'm going to give a beautiful example

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.960
 to my family member, to the others, of the Mahabharata, I'm practicing. Really feel those

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 strongly in the heart and mind, and may what I'm thinking, what may or what I'm doing,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 may it, by the blessings of the old enlightenment, work with myself, fulfill that, that kind of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.120
 wish,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.000
 and making kind of beautiful, to set forward, put stuff, kind of set, set that legacy, statement

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.160
 in our heart and mind. And then, giant prayers. Pray of the seven-mind prayers, and as well as

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.480
 those

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.800
 prayers. Pray, one way of praying is, is call of our devotion, joy and appreciation, and their

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.280
 blessings. We blend it in, completely mangled in. Their optimal veneration of work with

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.400
 myself, we're revitalizing, we're here, but throughout the Benetech and Pop, we all merge

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.800
 it as one single state, in the state of the devotion and joy and appreciation. Kind of feel that,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 that surrenderness of them, that blessings, very strong. And then finally,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.480
 Vadipayama Sambo, all the leading masters, dissolve to you, all your continually now,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.720
 do, do the rafuji prayers. Rafuji prayers is not, not in here, so we have to adopt that. And that

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 is,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.240
 I think, mostly very popular one, is that what we have, the rafuji and bodhi, the prayers of the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.920
 buddhasadanas, sanghi, chudan, sogil, pionana. All I tell, rafuji and the buddha dharmasanga,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.120
 to excellent buddha dharmasanga, until I am enlightened. And that is, and then I'll

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.560
 generate the bodhi together, to benefit for all the beings in the practice of six-fire mothers.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.560
 Mothers, I mean that, this is just what I said, is rafuji tasana. You have good tasana, and we

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.160
 have a book there, so join that prayers. This is a very popular technique, rafuji and bodhi to the

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.360
 practice, all the Tibetan buddhasadanas. Many great masters said, this was composed by the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.440
 kentuzong devotee. Kentuzong devotee prayed that. And some said, in teaching, said it was composed

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.840
 by the great master atishasadana. Either way, this is composed by one of the great masters,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.280
 and is so popular prayers. It is blessed by so many great masters, and practically throughout

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.720
 the century, all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, or eight schools of Tibetan Buddhism. They

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.040
 really

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.760
 practiced this again and again. So in a way, we are following their voice of the devotion, their

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.760
 courage, their commitment, their joy, their appreciation, their love, and their kindness,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.240
 and compassion. It's so special world. And kind of each world, when you join that, and of course,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.200
 you can join that also in English, put that into heart. Not just the same, of course the same is

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:21.040
 very special, but connect the meaning to the heart, but really kind of like activate our heart with

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.360
 joy and devotion, and both each other. And that is very, very special. Then we're making something

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.480
 changing our systems. With this Buddha's paragraph in Bodhicitta, and then this poor

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.440
 boneless prayers. Again, in the Buddha's heart, that do those prayers three times. And each

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.280
 rafuddhi and bodhicitta do it three times, three times as your... And this poor boneless, again,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.640
 is so special. I mean, you... I'm not just saying that. And can you read what you said that too?

00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.000
 When you read that, and how powerful it is, how beautiful it is, how genuine

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.640
 statement is, there's no slightly stance of the ego, selfish, greedy things. It's a total opening,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.040
 total crystallized statement. From the deep of the pure love and kindness and compassion and

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.280
 wisdom, thinking of all sentient beings, it's really so powerful prayers, so special for our

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.080
 prayers. As we pray, and we touch that to the heart, the meaning, it is something we're doing

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.760
 so beautifully, spiritually. Buddha mentioned it so many times in the teaching, even we have

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.240
 one instant thought of true love, love and kindness thought. Isn't it so much powerful,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.670
 benefit, so much power? It removes all obstacles, disease, sicknesses, bring joy and peace,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.200
 happiness

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.520
 to ourselves and joy and peace to the others, also non-visible beings. It always, they will

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.960
 become our protectors, help and supporters. Buddha said, repeated again and again, and therefore

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.680
 said, this loving kindness practice is one of the most powerful practices among all the practices.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.280
 It will also even in the teaching, not just even in the teaching said, that just by only practice

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.520
 that we will take immediately rebirth in higher realm when we leave this world, in the God's realm.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.720
 And therefore, even in the teaching said, this is called cause to take the bird in the higher than

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:39.600
 the shit I have, Brahma rams, ram of the Brahma's. And as you know, there's three rams, poor brain,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:48.320
 homeless, sorry, desire, poem brain and formless right. And this, in the poem brain is called,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:55.040
 there is Brahma rams, where the Brahma leaves. And this loving kindness practice is that

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.400
 immediately

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:03.680
 directly cause to take rebirth in that right. And they will name that. So then, and then

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.920
 comparison and then yoga and then economy. I mean, it's just so much treasure. It's true because we

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:20.480
 find that often that also the kind of very care, but how many teaching x stays this this kind of

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.520
 statement, this kind of prayers, you really read, you know more, more those all the different

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.640
 schools, different doctrines and all that. This is so special. It's so powerful practices.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.720
 And when you feel accepted in the heart, in the mind, in the presence of all the white beings in

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.520
 Gurbel Masambha, and they're white umbrella, then we really we're making touch, we're making true

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.920
 statement and true connection. We're making change. White umbrella, that is white umbrella. White

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:01.600
 umbrella is selfishness. White umbrella is true love, true completion, true joy, and totally great

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.280
 economic and great vastness state of the Pandya Paramata status. So when we touch that, we're

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:14.400
 touching it, true natures. And then our, it's also our true natures, true nature, we blend in

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:22.160
 without any separation and restrictions. This is something so special and beautiful. And we're

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.360
 making really true practice. We are true practice. We're setting up there. And this is, as he said,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.960
 and you know, you know, this brings peace and happiness to us, this brings peace and happiness

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.600
 to others, to whole world. There is no better peace matter, peace producer, than for all these

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.000
 practices. There's nothing, really nothing you can eat. There's something that you can tell us,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.640
 or tell me, we can think, but there's nothing else. This is just so you, most powerful. So do those

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.480
 pray, these prayers again, really, with those beautiful intentions and in presence of the

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.920
 white umbrella and gurupanma sambal, all lineage masters. And that is known as the first novel,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:21.120
 first novel, as he said. This is, is the first novel, novel. And then, finally, with it prompted

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.560
 those old opulent veneration, gurupanma sambal, all excited, all joined, because your intentions,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.880
 our intention, the beautiful intention, beautiful thought, they feel so happy, happy in the joy,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.720
 and our excitedly, and then give all the blessings to us, and that moment, they dissolve into light

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:42.720
,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.920
 and they dissolve back to you, and become, and mandala, the old nature of the mind. Have you

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.880
 have time? Do meditate for a few seconds or a few minutes. With that calm and soothing, and yes,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.880
 that is relative status, for a few minutes or a few seconds.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:15.440
 This is, as I said, said first novel ones. It is known as jurva-sipitama, in the debate it is,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.480
 the first, first beautiful intention, the novel beautiful intention with bodhicata and the devotion

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.160
 and rafuja confidence. And now we set up beautiful foundation, beautiful preparation,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.560
 beautiful ground. In a way, in a building level, if we construct something, we set up the beautiful

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:44.240
 now foundations, perfect foundation, foundation is perfect proportionally, measurement, strength,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:50.480
 alcoholic level is perfect. Have we planted the seed on the garden? We've perfectly beautiful seed,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.360
 preparation of the soil, and all that ground, manual, whatever the soil needed,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.960
 everything really prepared now. And this is the perfectly now set in our practices.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.840
 With this, and then, as in the teaching city, then are we going to visualize.
