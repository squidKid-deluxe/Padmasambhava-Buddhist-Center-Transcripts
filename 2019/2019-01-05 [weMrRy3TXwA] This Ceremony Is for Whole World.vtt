00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 Reactivating our body together with joy and devotion. We practice it tonight. It is not just for

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.000
 only ourselves or for some small purpose or reasons.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.230
 I really think we are doing this ceremony for all world. All the beings of six realms, bring them

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.000
 peace, happiness, joy, remove suffering, difficulty, troubles, conflicts,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.150
 and pacifying all those unbalanced situations. So we really kind of cooperate with each other in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.000
 the devotion.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.500
 There we have the power and the blessings of our greatest mother, H.H. Insoja. She is H.H.Insoja is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 a living Buddha.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 It is not just a cave in the ground. He is living Buddha right now.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.170
 He appeared in the form of many different emanations. Dharmakaya level, Sambokaya level, and namak

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.000
aya level.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 And he is namakaya Buddha, a living Buddha. Great Master, so often said, he is the mostly greatest

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 kindness mother who guides all the practitioners,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.890
 particularly practicing Vadiyana practices. So today we are reconnecting, reactivating to this very

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.000
 kindness, compassion mother.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.790
 So it is a great job in the appreciation and with the devotion. And then the child also is ignorant

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.000
.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 Every child is not just a child that can walk, they are wandering on by their lips. But it is seen

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.000
 from heart.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 And this is also meditation words. Each time we connect the meaning to the heart and be in this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 status.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And that is the very high form of the meditation, according to Vadiyana.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.180
 Immediately you are talking to the core of the true nature of reality, absolute level and relative

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 level.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 We are actuating to the enlightened states. So it is just really wonderful, beautiful, powerful.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And to dispel all the hesitation, doubts and all those jawari fabrications.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And coming to the right where we live, where we all belong. So all those, you all know this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 So I just remind you, I am reminding to myself, reminding to you all.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.130
 And with this now we begin to practice. Again with bodhicitta, sambhavi citta, bodhicitta and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.000
 devotion.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And then we begin.
