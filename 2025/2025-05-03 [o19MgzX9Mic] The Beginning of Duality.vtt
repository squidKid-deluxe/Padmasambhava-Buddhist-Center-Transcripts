Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nMay 1, 2025\n\nIncludes explanation from the Prayer of Kuntuzangpo, as well as an exploration of the \"three habits\" that shape every moment of our experience.\n\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.540
 It is the absolute bodhichatas. Anyway, it is developing, of course, here. So, whores, so that all,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.940
 with their temporary computations,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.180
 may be self-liberated through the Western illnesses, and in the space of the primordial purity,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 I generated a bodhichata in a great, immovable, resting space. So, that is really the absolute bodh

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.700
ichata.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.150
 When you're developing this picture, start with this bodhichata here. They say that they create the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.200
 computations.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:51.420
 Whore is the expression of the emitting or the joy, or, yeah, excitement, joy in every excitement.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.850
 Why you have the joy and excitement in this time? This time, because now you see that, like, the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 beautiful result of our enlightenment is right with us.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.790
 And all the sentences, even though they have so many troubles and difficulties, but that is short

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.140
 time, not just forever.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:20.800
 Because their nature is waiting, wake up to call. Everyone is ready, ready to do that. So, no one

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.580
 is out of that call, and every day, everyone is trying.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.060
 If they walk for their nature, they all have the right to get enlightenment. So, for that reason,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 some experience of the joy and apprehension for all the sentient beings they can get.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.830
 And the experience of the joy to ourself, one's own self. So, how is it wonderful that how I can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.660
 help them, how to do all these things I can help.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:58.310
 Help them and how blessed that I can help and support. At the same time, I'm going to discover my

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.060
 and their nature, nature and help for all beings.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.390
 So, there are many reasons to feel happy and joy and excitement. And then, in all these things,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.820
 they're temporarily compulsions.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.570
 So, that means, also, everyone is the same nature. We all have the same nature. But due to our own

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.100
 mistakes, then we are composed.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.300
 Those are the teachings said. At the beginning of the time, everyone is, before that, as we joined,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.740
 the prayer, the prayer of the Kundal Zampum, and what?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:50.000
 Ho, all the samsara-phenomena existences, all the existing phenomena are same foundation, but true

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:02.380
 thoughts, and all are the same foundation, but true thoughts and true results, achieved.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:11.280
 All is the same. So, all nature is really pure from the beginning. There is no any, even the name

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.580
 of the delusions, no name of the obscurations at all.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.770
 Everything is so perfect and pure. That's the one. But then, the ani, or this dharmakaya, that we

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.620
 know, which also can detect ourselves a little bit,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.580
 even dharmakaya is completely pure and open, vastness status, pure from the beginnings. I mean,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.820
 those all explain the color of this dharmakaya, our own nature of the mind.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:54.480
 It has all that energy we explained, we went through, and the teachings said sampukaya energy is

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.780
 already there, ready to act, act.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:07.680
 So, when it's ready to act at that time, when that's ready to act, and then, such as the Buddha Sam

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.180
hana Bhaddara, a Koda teaching, when that energy arises, that moment,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.630
 Buddha Samhana Bhaddara recognized it is self-display, self-display from the dharmakaya nature, or

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 one's own awareness ever used,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.410
 is a display of the one's own awareness. That moment, we recognize that moment, we relax it, that

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.380
 moment, that display is merged back, and the teaching is liberated back to the dharmakaya status.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:56.270
 Then, Samhana Bhaddara becomes the enlightenment Buddha. We sentient beings, same nature, same

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:04.060
 thing happened, all sentient beings, when that energy arises at the beginning of time,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:13.570
 that energy of the mind, that display, that from the sampukaya energy arises, immediately we,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:23.500
 sentient beings, react it. We react it and react it as subject and object.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:33.940
 That arising energy, we didn't detect that it's a self-display. We see this something different. We

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.340
 react it.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.950
 And that, as the teaching said, is the beginning of the duality. That means, duality means the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.460
 beginning of ignorance, inborn ignorance.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.870
 That panic, or that kind of reaction created all, then duality becomes bigger and wider, wider, and

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.500
 then continue to create it.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:13.340
 Then, then we dilute it. Then we start developing all different habit patterns. Our own dream, we

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.620
 didn't recognize, is our own display of the mind.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:27.240
 I have used that example. And then we hold as subject, object, as real, and then created all habit

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.780
 patterns.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:41.920
 Those are then, in the teaching said, all different three habit patterns we created. Habit pattern

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.940
 of the poems, habit patterns of the usages.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:56.540
 And then habit patterns of the, maybe, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say habit patterns, habit patterns of

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.700
 the areas, or area of, habit patterns of the areas.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:19.880
 Habit patterns of the, habit patterns of the area, or as I used to ask later that way. I'm sure

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.300
 this is the problem I mentioned many times to you all, many of you know that habit patterns.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.720
 And there also is a very, very famous, famous teaching, habit patterns of the, if I use translate

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:41.780
 this way, habit patterns of the, yeah, habit patterns of the place, place,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:52.200
 habit patterns of the object, habit patterns of the poems. So those are three. Now I'll explain so

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.580
 you will understand more in that.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:04.470
 Habit patterns of the place is then the whole, this universe, world very well. All this is, and all

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:14.750
 this universe and the world, such as mountain, water, earth, and you know all that is, is the habit

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.980
 pattern of the places.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:24.110
 And then together with that habit pattern, together with that habit pattern, all the five object

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:31.380
 with senses, senses, poem, sound, smell, taste, touch.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.950
 A touch, those are the five object of the places that what I translated today, and now you can take

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.140
 all the books and how they translated that.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:53.600
 And the second one is, then, second habit pattern is, is the, I think I translated object, I

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.700
 believe, but maybe I translated that way, object, subject, and, and the poem.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:12.720
 Object, poem is all the universes and as well as five object, and object, subject, subject, habit

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:23.430
 pattern is at consciousness and as well as all our good activity and bad activity or negative and

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.500
 positives.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:33.290
 So that is second one. Third object, habit pattern is poems, poems, and that is the poems of our

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:41.540
 individual forms or whatever the beings we are, which ever beings we are in the six realms.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:50.670
 So their forms and then together with that habit pattern, if their own habit patterns of the limbs,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:57.380
 and the limbs, those are all in the limbs and the fingers and so forth.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:03.680
 So those are the three habit patterns in the teaching mechanism. So that is how really we develop

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.180
 that.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.940
 When we develop those habit patterns or start developing from the beginner's times,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.220
 sense is a beginner's time to develop that and therefore then this our way of perceiving these

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.220
 subject and object that become very distant.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:28.900
 Even though this object is our creations, but it becomes distant from us, so very separated to us

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:36.180
 and our subject is kind of our mind and object is external, is separated.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:45.570
 So therefore, this present time, these are all objects. What we see is our mind, according to the

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:53.460
 teaching, is not really your mind, even though it started from the creation of the mind, yet

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.980
 because it's so long, so many countless lives, countless years,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.770
 it just becomes completely separated, separated from each other. So therefore, because that's what

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:14.020
 we hold, that's what we grasping, according to the teaching, then it's not exactly in our mind,

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.540
 even though it is really the comfort of mind.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:28.500
 But what is the mind is our appearance of this. When we see, when we hear, when we smell, when we

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:38.260
 test, when we touch that appearance to each senses, that is mind.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:47.080
 Mind, that is the mind, including our mind. So those are habit patterns and each time those

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:56.340
 emotions become stronger and stronger and more heavy and more heavy and they created all this.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.090
 Everything is created by the mind and the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakti, when he gave these

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:11.020
 examples, examples, again, maybe I say, trying to remember that, that is in the teaching said, for

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.780
 example,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:25.880
 say that this way, this way, our according Buddhism, where our art is residing, that our earth is

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:33.220
 where, where is existing, or where is art is relying now.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:50.140
 Our art is relying on the water, where water is relying on the wind, where wind is relying in the

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.860
 space, where space is relying.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:07.400
 Space is not relying on the wind, space is not relying on the water, space is not relying on the

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.700
 earth, space is not relying on any of those elements.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:30.800
 Pretty. Similarly, our, we present our, our, all these five aggregates eating dhatus, where is it

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:42.660
 relying, all that is, where is it relying, that is relying with all our karmic activities,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.460
 different activity of the karma.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:14:06.020
 And where our karmic activities are relying is in purple, in purple, and the karmic way is relying,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:12.740
 in purple attitude of the mind, or in purple mind.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:25.010
 So is all the karmic emotions are relying on the, in purple mind, in purple mind or unmannered mind

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:33.300
, unmannered mind. Unmannered mind, where is it relying?

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:43.720
 Unmannered mind is relying on the pure nature of the mind. The pure nature of the mind, where is it

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.100
 relying? Is it not relying any places?

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:56.710
 That's the how. Emotions and all that develop, this old habit of happiness is developed, getting

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:07.860
 stronger. So this is what really the nature is. Therefore, it is temporarily arising delusions.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:14.400
 Of course, for the sentient beings, when we never reverse ourselves, sometimes it lasts a long time

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.240
, but reality really is temporary. For those reasons, in the greatest teaching and all those great

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.660
 masters use examples.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:31.680
 This is it all, these emotions, all these obscurations lay as clothing in the sky. Clothing is

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.100
 temporary. It's not forever. Sky, clothes are never glued with the sky.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:48.000
 Clothes are not glued with the sun and the stars and the moons. It's all temporary, that develop.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.660
 That's something that we can clearly, can change. And for that reason, with that understanding,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.100
 then how it is, how it is.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.100
 and then the second one, you see the...
