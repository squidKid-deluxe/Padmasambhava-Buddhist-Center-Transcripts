00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.600
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
 And so, with the upper dissolving, there's all the optograftages.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.720
 And meditating on that stage.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 All that started from our mind, and now emerging back

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.640
 to the mighty state, it all started from the nature

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 of the mind.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 And now, let it back to its own soul.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.480
 Let that relax and liberate within that natural state

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 and meditate as long as you can.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.880
 And then dedicate the day.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.440
 And then again, for example, next stage

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 is in the various half of practice.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 Again, we delight in the various half

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.640
 and the receiving, reciting the mind in the same way

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.440
 with the body, with all those brutal intentions,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080
 and the resumability, resolve and meditate.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.960
 So that means every second of the practice,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 united truly with Dzogchen meditation,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.080
 really is the arising energy of the Dzogchen,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.560
 or the nature of the mind.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.600
 The nature of the mind arising is narmakaya,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.480
 and the sambhokaya, all that said, introduced.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.440
 All those displays, what you visualize in meditate,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.200
 they are the emanation, the display of the sambhokaya.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.920
 Let that back to dissolve to the, again, the dharmakaya state.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.440
 And generally, they all not separate from each other.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.840
 You already mind will kind of see something distinct,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 but actually they all said,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.840
 there's nothing any difference at all.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.200
 And they're relaxing in that natural state.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 So known as then, perfectly balanced, union, all that.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680
 Union and balance and inseparable,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.040
 that all means the balance, perfectly balanced,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.720
 not either side.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.760
 Side, every right side is not balanced.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 Every left side is not balanced.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.960
 And that's what we call maintaining in the balance.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 And I think when we write the hopes,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.320
 also, every leaning to the right side,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 we will hope, unless you have asked for follow-up plays.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.880
 Unless you go, what's called the Prince of Luke.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.200
 Eh? Maybe you can lean in different directions.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.360
 We're going to stay.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 Normal average person, we have to stay in the balance.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.680
 That's what every right side, you will fall.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.560
 Every left side, we will fall.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 We have to stay right in the center.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240
 And we like to write beautiful quotes

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.520
 on the beautiful course of the world.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.240
 Incidentally, we don't end up

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.280
 to going, what's called, falling to the 9-1-1.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.120
 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:14.560
 And that is, again, as I said, many times

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.800
 in the Dzogchen teaching, and we said a few times already,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 and you already know this and nothing.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.960
 And one time, some of us said again,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.760
 that we can always focus on the Dzogchen rule

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.920
 as negation status, no need, no need.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.080
 This is not needed for the Dzogchen vision,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 that every star said, you become extreme.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.280
 That is then almost ending up to the nihilism status.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.440
 We're spoiling our practices.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.280
 That's repeatedly in the teaching series.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.840
 That is extreme.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.160
 And we are leading the right side or left side.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.800
 It's not in the center.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.640
 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:26.640
 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.040
 And therefore, then always this is.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.280
 Always say, united target both the Dzogchen meditation.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.840
 Inseparable.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.280
 We don't make choices, isn't that?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.240
 Separate choices.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.640
 And that is what it is.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.120
 As in the teaching series, and you all know,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.720
 that mind is empty, empty is mind.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.560
 Mind.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240
 Although arising, like such as Sambokaya,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.680
 Nirmakaya is Dharmakaya.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 Dharmakaya is Sambokaya and Nirmakaya.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.000
 They're not separate at all.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.240
 That is the reality level of the true magic.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.200
 Therefore, we should practice the same way.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.480
 And the emptiness is the opinions.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360
 The opinions is the emptiness.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 And the united target, that is our goal.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.640
 But again, in order to kind of like clear

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.120
 away this regiment of duality, then we

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.760
 can maybe put some chance of this,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.280
 like such as meditation on emptiness

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.000
 or meditation on compassion.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.200
 We can do that.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.400
 But eventually, this whole union--

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.000
 I mean, actually it's a union.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.440
 This only way, apply it as we need it,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.680
 need it in order to reduce and clear away

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.000
 the disturbance of duality.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.520
 Techniques are slightly used in different ways.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.320
 But reality level, it is union.
