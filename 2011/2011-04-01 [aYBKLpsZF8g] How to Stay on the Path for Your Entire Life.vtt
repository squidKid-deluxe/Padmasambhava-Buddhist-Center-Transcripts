NOTE     "synopsis": "An important teaching about how to not be swept away by distractions once we enter the path of Dharma, so that we become good practitioners rather than \"Dharma tourists.\" On March 29, 2011 at Padma Samye Ling during the 2011 month-long Dzogchen retreat, Khenpo Rinpoche strongly emphasized how important it is to absorb the Buddha's simple, essential message of love, compassion, and wisdom into our hearts so that our practice continues in the right direction. Having less desire and more contentment is truly noble.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Swept away by the distractions, even they entered in the Dharma at the first place, and that

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 happened many times in the past, many times happening now, and what happened in the future, and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.500
 that also happened to us.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.900
 So therefore, this teaching is actually, of course, is highlighted in the guideline how we become

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:34.210
 really good practitioners, good practitioners, not just we become the Dharma visitors or Dharma

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.500
 tourists.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 Many times, if Dharma didn't go the Dharma asylum in the direction, in fact, as we teach, as we

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 pray, then almost we become Dharma visitors and Dharma tourists.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:19.870
 Many of us, we went to the Disney World, Disney World, we saw wonderful things, magic mountain, it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.970
 caught, it was called the Civil World, Civil World and all of those, and then even the waters are

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.100
 jumping, that was very astonishing, spring is really jumping, from the other side of the path to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.500
 the other side of the path, that was so amazing,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.840
 and my father, we all went together, and he was so surprised, and all of everything is like, the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.280
 school is very beautiful, that was striking for him, I go to him, kind of like, he's really jumping

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.120
, and all these things, he's wonderful, and it's been good memories, we can say, I'm saying, I saw

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.500
 those things, it's good things, but really what happened to us, what happened to us,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.670
 seeing that, similarly, if Dharma don't go in the right direction, we become like a tourist of Vay

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.500
ayana practitioner.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.630
 In Vayayana there's a lot of us there, this teaching, during Vayayana, visualization, dissolving,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.500
 in so-called one another, it's in one way, it's so exciting, in a way.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.700
 He's definitely, in the Buddha teaching said, once you heard Dharma, it will happen, sonar led to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:34.720
 that, but to kind of a practical level, current level, it won't help too much, if Dharma don't go

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.500
 in the right direction, as in bridge, so for that reason here, his home is highly important here.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.880
 To enter the path of Dharma, it's not enough to enter the outer appearance, or the name, outer

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:01.500
 appearance as practitioners, or outer appearance as Buddhist practitioners.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:11.500
 We have to merge the teaching through the heart, through the mind, and that many times that

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:20.700
 happened, so therefore, we must be let don't fill ourselves on that ditch, ditch that we saw, we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 seen, and what is that?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.980
 What that will make? It's not going to be changed, except in a way, that individually, become the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.500
 then, in a way a loser.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.420
 They didn't go on exiling what they thought, and not just only that, many times that happened, then

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.130
 this also, Vindhama don't go on the right direction in mental nerve, and start to kind of almost

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.500
 like targeting the teaching.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.880
 And the practitioners, the sangha members, and so forth, I mean, his home is also talking that

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.520
 laugh at the end of this, this, and almost, almost seeing everything is kind of all not correct,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.500
 not right way.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:19.390
 All that happened, happened. This is why it's happened, because teaching is not absorbed correctly

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:29.650
 into the heart. That means also, there is less joy, less appreciation, less graceful, graceful in

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.500
 devotion.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.240
 All those are lost, and then always highlight also, something fancy things, fancy things, but then

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.500
 there is no ground, no solid.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.710
 And looking up, as in Vindhama, you always, many times, it's like the examples, and we're looking

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:53.500
 so much up, and up, like, we can break out, what's called, necks, or columns, looking too much up.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.180
 And that really happened, happened. So therefore, to award these things, we must be teaching

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:10.500
 absorbed with joy, and appreciation, and devotion, grateful, and look to ourself.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.860
 And then we will stand there. This is what it's called, checks and balance. In a way, with checks

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.500
 and with balance.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.700
 And we match stronger and move forward, with vision, with joy, with appreciation. Then everything

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.500
 is good.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.720
 Good, we start with good. We're doing quite okay, which definitely will be okay. Next. Next. So

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.500
 therefore, here, as is what we said, say, this is what we need to introduce.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:57.340
 And then here. And then there also, we have to, we have to enter, so we have to serve all types of

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.500
 the desirable things, and to activate the limit of this life.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:15.610
 I'll send you the second, don't you? That, again, of course, you notice. This, our, the desire is

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.500
 always strong.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:26.590
 Not just of only us, but all of you. We have desire, desire and that. And we have also so many

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.500
 things, things.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 So now, what we need here? We need, what they call, contentment. Content, content, content.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:47.500
 Content, all we feel, happy, we should feel satisfaction, satisfaction and joy, what we have there.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 This contentment, actually, is so special. In the, that part practitioner, Buddha Shakyamuni told,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 in the teaching, of course this is all teaching, following the teachings of the Buddha.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:19.260
 Buddha, that, but in the teaching says, that means less desire, more content is noble. Less desire

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:28.500
 and more content, less desire, and that is really noble.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:38.260
 Because what it makes? It makes more peaceful. Ourself more peaceful. And also, it makes ourself

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.500
 more joy, more appreciative.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:49.850
 What do you have? Many times, again, as I said yesterday, and as you know, we don't really

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.500
 appreciate things, but we have.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:01.550
 We want. Always, this desire is something wanting more and more and more. Even if God is not enough

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.500
, go on and on and on.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.890
 There is a story in the Buddha Shakyamuni taught. Long time ago, Buddha Shakyamuni, before we

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:18.500
 become the Buddha, he become one of the very famous king of the universe.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:27.980
 The universe of king, known as Nalendub. Nalendub is a very famous king, universally, in the Buddha

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.500
's teaching. It's been long time ago.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:39.800
 Like, countless years before, once upon a time, Buddha Shakyamuni was born as king, known as Nalend

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.500
ub.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:49.110
 He was the ruler of all the continents, four continents, east continent, south continent, west

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.500
 continent, and north continents.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.010
 He wrote. It's called "Kholi Jirwa" in the Tibetan teaching. He said, "Oh, Buddha teaches in Kholi

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.500
 Jirwa."

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:19.500
 He said, "The most powerful one is the golden, then the silver, then the copper, then iron."

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:28.500
 For example, this king of Shambhala in the teaching said that he is the iron will.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:39.500
 So, according to that category, he is the fourth one. The fourth one is the golden will, who turned

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:46.500
 and moved forward his force with that, or his garrison and all the atra with that.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:56.280
 So, and also, when this Kholi Jirwa, this monarch in the teaching said, when they conquered other

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:02.500
 countries, all those continents, they don't harm anything.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:12.500
 That's what the great master Basubendu said in the Abhidhana Koshya.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:23.560
 Koshya, this universal kings are advancing their garrisons. Garrisons, the opponents, the first

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.500
 golden will, they're welcoming.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:37.480
 Just go under them. It's nothing really fighting and violence. Pay. So, and the second and the

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:44.500
 third, third is only third and fourth, only what they have to do.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:53.190
 They put those garrisons on the possessions. Positions, by doing that, then there's no other

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.500
 opponent immediately bow to him.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.500
 So, therefore, no really harm or the violence happens in the teaching said.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.500
 And that's the beauty and the quality of this powerful kings.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:15.940
 So, the ancient time, this Kholi Jirwa, who ruled all of them. So, now, he is the ruler of all four

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.500
 continents.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:28.500
 Now, still, he's not satisfied. He thought what to do. He saw, he couldn't rule, the guards ran.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:37.740
 Then he directed his golden will, the tolerance for golden will, up to the top of the mountain, Sum

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.500
erus, and all his garrisons and antaracts followed with that.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:54.120
 And immediately, king of god, Indra, welcomed him and received him with his receptions. So, he

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.500
 became the, in a way, ruler of God.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:05.730
 But now, Indra, because the Indra is, actually also in the Buddha's teaching, had so much merit, so

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:12.500
 much good karma, so much good karma, that's why he became the king of Indra.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:20.500
 So, the Malenas karma and Indra karma is equal, equal.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 Malenas karma is not higher than Indra.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:30.880
 So, now, in the Buddha's teaching, he said, Malenas and Indra, they bought the city in the same

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.500
 throne and sharing throne, throne.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.500
 And Malena was not happy with that. Happy.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.500
 He thought, I wish Indra go away. Indra go away.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:53.260
 The moment he thought that, in the teaching sense, he fall down to the earth. The moment he thought

00:12:53.260 --> 00:13:00.500
, when he fall down on the earth, everything has changed.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:08.500
 Even nobody recognized him. Nobody recognized him and he felt so sad.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.500
 And we put it away and then he ended his, that one life.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:20.500
 And the Buddha said, who was that? He said, once upon a time, he was born.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.880
 Buddha Shakyamuni was born as king of Malena. And he said, the arrows and the thorns of the

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.500
 discontent and the men, or the decisive factor, they have to share it.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.880
 Even he is not enough, the sharing the throne with the end of the earth, that's not enough, he

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.500
 wished Indra go away.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:49.500
 This is the world. So many things lead. This desire is, of course, always really obstacle.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.880
 It makes. If we don't make the balance, if we don't make the contentment, if we don't put the

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.500
 breath under that, it just carries away.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.500
 And that's to use the examples of all the teachings that you saw. I'm sure you read.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:18.700
 This is six senses. It's so hungry. Six senses, I senses, A senses, now senses, now tongue senses,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.500
 body senses, and then this mind senses.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:30.750
 It's all too hungry. Hungry. If we don't put the awareness in intelligence to this, it never going

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.500
 to say, okay, enough.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.500
 And then it ended up with so many topics, all the time.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 In the teaching using examples, if it's by too much desire and attachment, what happens?

00:14:48.500 --> 00:15:03.500
 In the teaching sense, then the beasts are trapped in the floors, beasts are trapped in the floors.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:14.230
 And too much desires of the running for the crying for the song, the deers are killed by the

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.500
 hunters.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:24.910
 I think that's all the story. In Buddhism, it's very story, so always in the teaching sense, these

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:30.500
 deers, deers always loved the beautiful song.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.500
 I don't know. In West, they said that? No. Not that, right?

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:42.340
 But in Buddhism, they say, so there's a lot of stories, ancient art. When the hunters led to hunt

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.500
 with the deers, they played the beautiful flute, flute.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.500
 Well, deers are listening, that and hunters keep them.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:02.500
 So in teaching using examples, too much desire to the senses of the, or crying of the senses of the

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:10.500
 ear, then look to the deers, lost their lives of the deers.
