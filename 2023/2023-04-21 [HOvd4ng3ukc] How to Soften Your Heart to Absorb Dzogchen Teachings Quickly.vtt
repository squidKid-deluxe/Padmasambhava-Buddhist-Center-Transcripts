00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you for your participation, and again, coming to Gedhe here. It's so thankful.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.270
 And again, with the beginning of the practices, the teachings, or where we're starting, where we're

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.000
 contemplating,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 where we're meditating practices, always in the world, teaching highlights the importance of the,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 to put, what's called, to activate it with motivation, the motivation. And because there are so

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.000
 many motivations,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 some motivations are the samsara motivation. That means cause of samsara and result of samsara

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 is the continuation of the samsara activities. And that we don't need now.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 And so what we need, we need the motivation that will accelerate it and help and support to our

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 discover

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.430
 on this time with the Dzoxchen state, the nature of the mind. Our Dzoxchen mind, or our trichaya

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.000
 status,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 the elected discoverer. And always in the teaching making, the enlightenment is not outside.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 It is like here, with us. But then why we didn't see this? Because with our kind of mistakes,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 or naive, or due to a kind of looking, something different direction with force or power of the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.000
 duality,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.880
 we carried with from the point of the nature. And therefore, then we distanced our own nature by

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.000
 ourself.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.430
 And today we're returning back to discoverer of that innate nature. Therefore, to start with the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.000
 motivation,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.240
 that motivation is lined up with the nature of the trichaya, dharmakaya, sambhokaya, and dharmakaya

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.000
 nature.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.990
 And that is lined up that. And so therefore, then we distended it, suggested it, we need to put joy

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.000
 in appreciation.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Joy in appreciation, we're not joy in appreciation of all the samsara activities that we do.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.580
 We're not that one. This time we're very joy in appreciation. So our goodness qualities, what we

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.000
 have,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 what we are so honored. Things of the goodness qualities, that we really so honored.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Even we are midst of the midst of the samsara, but yet there are so many good qualities

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 that we are really prompted with love, compassion, joy, fortune, and all the abundance of qualities

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.000
 that we have.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 This all is so wonderful. It's beautiful. This is according to the Buddha's teaching. It's not just

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 came by itself.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.430
 It has cause and condition. That cause and condition is not somebody else's did and piled up to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.000
 earth because their kindness is completed.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 No. According to the teaching, we accumulated those cause conditions in vast large times, even

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.000
 though maybe we don't detect them.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 But the result we are experiencing, that definitely we did according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Therefore, we should appreciate and thankful of our past deeds that even we don't see right now.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Thankful and happy and joy, we did good in courage to our self. Appreciate.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And now what we need to do? That's not enough. Now we have to make that more stronger.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 We did good things in past, but it's not enough. Still we are in samsara.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.080
 Still we are in the midst of all these ups and downs of the emotions and difficult challenge and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.000
 excitement, the anxieties and all these things.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 We are really right in the middle of that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But therefore, we have to go through these storms, these thunderstorms. We have to go through.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And nobody else is going to make us go that way. The Buddha's teaching says they give the teaching

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 and stalking us.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 But we have to put jobs. We have to put activities.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And that is motivation. Start the motivation. Power of the mind.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Mind is so important, I mean the teaching says, and we all understand really.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 When we think carefully, mind is so important. So important.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.430
 Mind controls every of our directions, our perceptions, our conceptions, our ideas, our way of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.000
 thinking, the ideas, everything.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.250
 No one else controls it unless we believe. That belief is also mine too. It's not something that,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.000
 something.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So it's not something that really else controls it. It's our self.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.220
 We have every tools and every powers and every engagement, and every end-stockings we receive. And

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.000
 you all know this.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.550
 And for example, we are now engaging with Doki teaching and Doki meditation practice. We all know

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.000
 that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 But this Doki is not just only intellectual. And we receive that and then just let it go.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 That is not going to help us. Completely what we want to. Like to get or what in the teaching said,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 it will help.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.360
 That's not going to help. What we have to do after receiving the teaching, with joy and with

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.000
 appreciation, with devotion, with humble, with humility.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.680
 Do unto the earth, in honor, receive that precious, precious golden necklace and absorb that in the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.000
 heart and mind.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.120
 And how to absorb in the heart and mind? Practice. Practices will be absorbing that in the heart

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.000
 and mind.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 I'm just honoring, I'm respect, I'm appreciate, which is good, but it's not going to absorb that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 To make it change our self.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Truly we have to practice. That is absorbing, that is engaging, that is improving.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Therefore, this motivation starts with good motivation, good heart.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.350
 In samsara, always said, oh, that person has good eyes. He has or she has good heart. That is that

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.000
 good heart.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Now, this is, this time, not that good heart is kind of limited, but both each other.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Joy and appreciation, love and kindness, comparing it to all beings.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.950
 Even the joy, even the docket, even the body, really sincerely feel in the heart. Heart, the

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.000
 greatest benefit of all human beings.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Remove all the suffering, difficulty, challenges. So many things are going on in samsara.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.750
 This is something we can contribute to. Toward the world, please. Toward removing the suffering and

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.000
 trouble in the world.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.230
 With our good heart and good intention and with praise. Those are, those are maybe very kinder and

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.000
 many things, many times we think, oh, those are kinder, there is a basic.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 But this basic is so important. We do the basic, we won't discover the greatness of the basics.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Everything is relying on the basics. So important. Joy and appreciation.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 When you think of the really true joy and appreciation and bodhicata, that state of mind, you look

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 very little.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Little anger. Jealous. Eighty talk. And worries. Israeli strength. Calm and peaceful. Happy.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That is what we call basic, but that is essence. Essence teaching.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 If we touch to that, we are touching to the goal of the essence of our nature.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.800
 Even good, we have been practicing so many years, but we have to touch, we have to really glorify

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.000
 our joy in the appreciation, appreciation and bodhicata.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And then bodhicata is what we call is love and kindness and compassion.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.710
 That's the teaching said. But this love and compassion, bodhicata, compassion and kindness is not

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.000
 limited to love and compassion.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Bodhicata's love and compassion has no boundaries. That is bodhicata love.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Not just love and compassion. It is so good, so important.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.620
 That's the value and the richness of the human beings or the beings, because they start reflecting

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.000
 from primordial stages.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 It's so special, but boneless love or limited love, that is bodhicata love.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.440
 There's no boundaries, no restructures. No khandra like khandra like this, this way our life is

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.000
 love, this way not undone love.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 It's always pervasive. That is love and compassion. And so powerful.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 That is the core of the Heartway Enlightenment. That is bodhicata.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 That is zhoqin, absolute bodhicata, zhoqin teachings. So it's so important.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Again, thinking of all living beings, we all know this, we all know, we all do practice it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 But we have to activate that, really, sincerely from the heart and mind.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 And we do those things. Then this poor renunciation also will settle down so nicely.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 We know poor renunciation, or for this poor point that will change the mind.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 We've heard it so many times. But how much we are engaging and really reflecting on that once.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 And precious lives. And think of that, precious lives.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Why is precious lives, in the Buddha's teaching said, difficult to obtain these precious lives?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Why is it difficult? And think that carefully.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.080
 In Buddhism, what is in the Buddha's teaching said, it didn't endowments, or add freedoms in a ten

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.000
acious.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 How many times we reflect into the add freedoms? What add freedoms?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.950
 Add freedoms, poor freedoms are the non-humans. And poor freedoms are human beings, connected with

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.000
 human beings.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 But how much we reflect? That also indicates, the life is, we take lives, we take the rebirth.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Our rebirth is not just our choice.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Our choice, kind of what we want. Do everything what we like to do, but we like to have our choice.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 No. It's also, according to the teaching, it's all with karmas.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Who does karma? We do now.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Karma is what? Again, no other than the mind. Mind is broken.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.680
 So if we like to have really turned our rebirth from the lower realms, it's always in the teaching

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.000
 said, right now, turn the mind from the negativities.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Cause of the negativity, take the result as rebirth and three lower realms.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:35.840
 So then, these three lower realms, and as well as asuras, or the God realms, those are four non-

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.000
human realms.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 We are out of that. And plus add four freedoms of the human beings. We are also out of that.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So we have the all freedoms. And you, I'm sure you read those things, but you think that, really.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.080
 Today you think that, and tomorrow you can have, we will understand all tonight, we're going to

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.000
 understand what are those add.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Add. Just think that. And then add three, ten luxuries.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Five luxuries related with our self, own self, and five luxuries related with others.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.800
 And that is, we also have ten luxuries. You know that. You heard that. We heard that. Not just you,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.000
 I heard, we heard, all that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.980
 But how many times we reflected. And when we reflected that, what it makes our lives more precious,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.000
 more rich.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.720
 Really, it's so precious, so rich, so important. And then maybe some degree of courage and

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.000
 commitment, I'm going to make this meaningful life.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.080
 Meaningful life is not something that we have to make strange things. It's just a more culturally

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.000
 kindness, compassion, more relaxed.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.500
 Not carry the force of the emotions and negativities, as always it does. And that is really, anyway

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.000
, we cannot carry them.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.720
 We can't self-contain our self. Subscure our self with very gentle, peaceful way. That is not a

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.000
 meaningful life.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Then it makes meaning to these spaces, as schools. So therefore, this motivation is so important.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Of course, we all know that.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.320
 But yes, I highlight that to them as much as I can. And together with this, then the very other

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.000
 teaching.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.040
 And the Dokki teaching is a Three Caiya status. All Three Caiya in the Dokki teaching, Dharma Caiya

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.000
, Sambo Caiya, Narmak Caiya status.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.310
 That is according teaching is realities. It's really true. It's true. But we are not seeing that

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.000
 right now, because of due to our mistakes.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.370
 Mistakes of the long time. And we just completely kind of cover up by our self. Ourself. So now we

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.000
 are exploring that.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 We are also exploring that Three Caiya, Caiya, Trejure by the simple thing of the Dokki techniques.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.220
 Dokki is the most powerful teaching and a technician in the teaching state. It is swiftly

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.000
 discovered in techniques.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.620
 But even though Dokki is so self-powerful and is quickly discovered in nature, but we have to again

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.000
 have the courage, commitment, and bodhijaka, and devotion.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 All that we need. Why we needed that? Because they are the line of the pre-emotional nature.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.430
 And that when we cultivating those attitude and told, what is known as indigeneable teaching,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.000
 accumulation merit. That's called accumulation merit.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:13.240
 In one sitting we are accumulating two merit, accumulation, joy, appreciation, bodhijaka, devotion

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:19.000
als. All those are accumulation merit practices.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.940
 And then this Dokki merit taking itself, most merit. So in one sitting we are accomplishing two

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.000
 merits.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.270
 In other words, joy, we concentrate on that. Joy, appreciation, bodhijaka, those are generously

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:46.000
 practiced paramata and morality paramata, patient paramatas, and concentration paramatas.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.130
 And then your effort is supported to that. And also it is Dokki merit taking itself versus the

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.000
 paramata.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 So therefore, even in one sitting we are accomplishing six paramata practices, completely.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.200
 And therefore, in the Buddha teaching and all the great masters, in order to discover the

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:12.000
 realization of the true nature or the enlightenment, we need two wings of the accumulation.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Accumulation merit versus merit. Both are so important. So joy, appreciation, devotion, prayers.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.410
 The realists were not underestimating prayers. In the body together, the relative true body

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:32.000
 together, all those are accumulation merit practices.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.080
 All are practiced. Then once the year has completed and looking to the nature of the mind,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.000
 wrestling the nature of the mind, a call to Dokki.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 That is the Western merit. So in one sitting we are accomplishing two merits.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.760
 So those are, in the teaching, said that. So we have always activated those thoughts, and as much

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.000
 as we can, it's so important.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.070
 And those reasons, also we're not always in the teaching, said Mundo practice. So important. A

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:09.000
 foundation practice, what we call in the individual Mundo practice.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Mundo is a foundation practice. A foundation practice is so important.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:31.120
 Otherwise Dokki teaching is so pervasive and so kind of like in a way, in a very special space. S-B

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.000
-C-E, I think space.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 It's kind of pervasive space. And therefore, then you kind of carry with that pulse.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.470
 And of course, if not absorbed so nicely, then we use the mistakes. Then we get wrong views of the

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.000
 Dokki.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.780
 Dokki views and wrong, again, meditation of the Dokki meditation and wrong conduct of the Dokki

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.000
 meditation.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.430
 Then we kind of dilute our views, meditation and conduct, all that. And then the result will be

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.000
 diluted.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.240
 Then we won't get there for this foundation. Mundo practices is so important. Mundo practice is

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.000
 mainly focused on the accumulation practice.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Accumulation practice, such as poor renunciation, reflecting poor renunciation.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.170
 Which is the essence of teaching of the Buddha as opposed to the noble truth. To the noble truth.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.000
 Suffering truth, the cause of suffering truth.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 That is called renunciation thought. It is really the essence of that. Of the dispersed truth.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Then the Mundo practice, those of which sometimes they are called the common Mundo practice.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Common Mundo, poor renunciation thought. Common Mundo.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.260
 What means common is actually? Common means the gender. It's not mysterious. It's not just a

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.000
 Buddhist dogma.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 It's not just a believer's thinking. That's the fact, reality.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.910
 Pressure, however, is precious to everyone, whether you believe or not, or whether you are

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.000
 practicing or not, is it?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Life is precious. It's common. Common understanding.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Even those who don't have any belief that you are asking someone, your life is precious.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 It's definitely a diversity. It's precious. It's so special.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 But we think they are more deeper. This precious life is not just kept by accident.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 This has something cause and condition, but how wonderful we are at that.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Now I have to not spoil these spiritual lives. I like to make something beautiful.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 For my future and future of all the living beings.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Really thinking was sincerely hard. That is extra going for our knowledge and wisdom.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Otherwise, everyone knows life is precious. For that reason, it's common.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Reflecting. See the treasure as treasure is known as wise is known.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 A person is an expert. That's a wise person. Wise man, men and women.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 See the precious as precious. And then second is what? In Patmanet.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 In Patmanet, it's also not something only the believers are thinking or the Buddhists are thinking.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 It's the reality, the fact of the phenomenon.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 No one says it's going to exist forever. And how is time changing?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Summer, spring. Or spring, summer, autumn, winter.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 And every minute or day, 24 hours, it's changing. And we change too.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.030
 From the time we are the mother or parents ten whole in our day in the two farms, now we are what

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.000
 we are.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 This is all that. Reflecting on that.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 That means in the Buddhist world, Buddha teaching says, it makes our heart more soft, more tender.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 We become more practical. Not wasting time.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Wasting time uselessly. And using time, then we use time.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 What not just wasting time, but it's kind of bouncing the priest to our own head by ourself.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 We spoil that. So have courage in commitment. Time is our sight.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Time is right now with me. I should use this for better purposes.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Have courage in commitment, combine it with the bodhicam that I really like to have.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And to improve myself, remove my difficulty, suffering troubles.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.620
 Follow with the footsteps of all those ancient great masters, great practitioners who practice and

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.000
 meditate.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And follow this path. Same path.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.400
 It's not that they follow something different path and they become the enlightenment of a greater

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.000
 master.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Exactly what we do. This is the same path.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Then the next one, that's called Koman.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Koman Hindu practices. Koman Hindu practices is so important, so spacious.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And then second one, third story, third one is what?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 That cause and effort are inevitable. That is not mystery again.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 This is not Buddhism, dogma or specials of Buddhism.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Everybody knows. The farmers knows. That's what they plant the seeds.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And the people do everything their money is to go.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Young children go to the college, the schools, and get high degrees, so they have future lives.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Future or better come to life. Everything.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 That means they know the cause. If you have a good cause, they have better results.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Cause and effort are inevitable. It's true.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 If a good cause, it has good results.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 If it's a bad cause, it has bad results.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 If it's a good and bad mixture, cause and then result is also mixture.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 That is, again, Koman knowledge.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Paribuddha said, again, it goes a little deeper, more strong.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So that is all good and bad. It's not just externally happening.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 It's fundamentally, it's the mind. It's karma.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Karma is not coming from outside. It's produce of our own mind.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Good mental state of the mind produces the good karmas.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Bad mental state of the karmas.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Our bad mental state produces the bad karma.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So bad karma and good karma is not coming from outside or nor is overloaded by someone.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 It's one's own creations.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Therefore, we like to have good things. Good things.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 One with our mind. And we like to avoid bad things. One with our mind.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 For that reason, the greatest feature of Buddha Hekta Muni said in the teaching,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 cause of suffering truths.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Cause of suffering truths.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 So let me, cause of samsara is not outside. It's our own mind.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 So we like to reverse the samsara, samsara. Walk with the mind.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 That's the one of the first day Buddha's teaching.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 So the next one is samsara.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Samsara has a lot of difficult challenges.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 That is also not a mystery, not conversation, Buddhist speciality.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Everybody knows, many of us, all that's the goal.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Even those who don't really have any beliefs say in the samsara has a difficulty,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 or the world has a difficulty.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 In this world there is many challenges and difficulties.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 If that is, for a reflecting reason, Buddhism goes a little deeper.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Samsara is not just only what we see.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 But according to Buddhism, there is six realms.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 All the six realms are going different challenges, difficulty, troubles.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Six realms are our destinations that we don't change our mind.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 That is our destination.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 According to our karma, our destination can be in a whole, those different realms.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 So if we like to change the destination of the samsara, change with this mind.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 That's really the teaching field, and it's true.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Our mind is so powerful, it produces.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 For that reason the Rachel's teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Manu said,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 "Say, tame your mind."

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 This is the teaching of the Buddha.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 "Tame our mind."

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Buddha did not say, "Tame your body."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 That is the teaching of the Buddha.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Buddha did not say, "Tame your speech."

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 That's the teaching of the Buddha.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 "Tame your mind."

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 That is Buddha teaching.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 So taming the mind is observing the teaching into the heart.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 What we tamed, tamed mind.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Tamed the wild mind.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 What is the wild mind?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Anger, jealous, and the combination of the anger and jealous ignorance, arrogance.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 And then there is all those six different emotions.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Twenty sub-emotions in the Abhidhana measures.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 All those are negative emotions.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Those are wild.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Those are wild, and those are the disturbances.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Those are the obstacles for those reasons in the teaching said.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 What did the Buddha teach?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 There is no more dangerous than our own mind.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 In the three realms of all, in the desire realm, the home brain, the homeless realm,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 there is not any more dangerous to ourselves than our own mind.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Our own mind is the most dangerous to ourselves, and we do not control.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 And we don't really provide.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 And we control, and we really take care of that.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Then to discover the treasure of our mind is so superior, even in the teaching said,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 there is no more better treasures in the three worlds, or in the samsara, nirvana,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 to discover of one's own innate nature of the mind.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 The reward is so beautiful, extreme, but also parallel, or the wrong side is so powerful.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 If we come to that mind case, or duality mind, really let it go, carry that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 So those are the teachings.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And of course, we all know this. We all heard this.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 But it is again our time to share sangha members, we just remind each other.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 That's what's called sangha, support each other along the path.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 We are all going together as much as we can do,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 with part of the Buddha and the Virabhama sambhava, and support each other.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 So reminding that, in a way, we all know those things.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 But taking care of this mind, so important.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And we all understand it. Now we go to this chakra.
