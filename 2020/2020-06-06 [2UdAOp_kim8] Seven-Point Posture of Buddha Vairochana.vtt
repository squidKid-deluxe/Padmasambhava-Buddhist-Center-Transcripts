00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.840
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, we continue with the teaching of the religious kindness,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 very gentle teacher of his Holiness Jyabhi Dunu, Jyabhi Dunu is teaching, and of course,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 Jyabhi Dunu is teaching, is teaching, essence teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 as well as the Gaurabhima Sambha, and all the linear masters of India, and all that,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.520
 putting into simple instructions so that we can understand by Jyabhi,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:07.600
 the new beings. And that teaching, we went on a very really detailed, and then thoroughly according

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.440
 my cover, to try to bring up your kind of more clarity of your teachings or your study,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.920
 and your knowledge of the Dharma, or sometimes, in some cases, trying to replace your memories of

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.400
 the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.280
 teachings that you received from many great masters and teachers, and also reading the books that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.520
 we

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.480
 went. And that is what really also teaching is, what Jyabhi Dunu is teaching is. So in this way,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.400
 again, we're going through that, and we went through everything, kind of in the frame,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 trying to make more kind of like practical way, more technical way, and portray every our practices

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.240
 into three categories. The first one is beginning noble, and then second is the principle noble,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.960
 and third is concluding nobles. That is generally, every of our practices should follow with that.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.720
 Just not just the practices, but every aspect of the teaching that what we learn in the Buddha's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 teaching, Buddhism. That means, whether you're studying the Buddhism, whether you're contemplating

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.440
 on the teaching of the Buddha, whether you're practicing in meditation on the teaching,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.840
 each of those put in this frame of these three nobles, beginning noble, middle noble, and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.880
 concluding nobles. That is what then really teaching the practice makes perfect. It comes so

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.480
 beautiful. As a great teacher, Buddha Hijatyamuni himself said, that beginning good, middle good,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.120
 ending good. All the excellent voting, excellent when you're contemplating,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 excellent result when you practice meditate. It comes beautiful. Everything will come

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.200
 perfectly. We're not never going to feel disappointed by that. We are perfectly beautiful.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.440
 So therefore, that's what we really follow as highlighted by the great master. In that way,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.360
 we went at the beginning time, we went beginning good. Again, we went all those things. I'm not

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.000
 going to feel now more about that. And the middle one is the practices. Practices, when you come to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 the practices, what are the practices? That means what you learned, now what you learned from the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.120
 teachers or from your books. Now you're putting that into the action, not just leaving that as

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.440
 intellectuals on the brain, observing to the heart. That is really the practices. So practices,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:10.080
 we discussed about four renowned Sahaja Mahatma talks and then taking raffles and developing the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.920
 bodhicata. That's what we discussed. And now, developing the bodhicata, bodhicata, we went again,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 oh, we're going still, going little bit details. Again, each point stops. And reaching bodhicata,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 we went very kind of really, but essential point, trying to catch the meaning, the essence meaning

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:44.880
 that we can catch. And as my capabilities, I kind of reminded to all of us. Then we came to the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 actualizing bodhicata. Actualizing bodhicata, there's a number of ways of performing the activity

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.720
 of the bodhicata in the Buddha's teachings. In the teachings, the bodhicata, bodhicata was

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.840
 activity. It's like all human-like activities, but all can summarize into six paramattas.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.160
 That's two great teachers in the teachings said. So with that, we followed a Kagan, followed the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.280
 six paramattas. Still we are following them, six paramattas. Among the six paramattas, we went

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:31.280
 first four paramattas. And today we are going to still the fifth paramatta, which is dhyun

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:41.760
 paramattas. Now dhyun paramatta is the meditation. That means the first three paramattas, such as

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:52.640
 generosity, morality. Patient is more physical, outreaching the bodhicata activities.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:04.880
 And then your effort is the fuel engine to pulse, or is pulse behind. That is to all the paramattas

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:15.200
 that we discuss too. Now is the fifth. Fifth is more related with mind now. So it's not physical,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:25.120
 but it's more mind. Mind is so powerful. Mind is a ruler of everything. Our body, our speech,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:36.800
 our perception, our conception, all is ruled by our mind. Mind. And mind is instrumental.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:46.160
 We will discuss it. Mind is the source of all samsara and nirvanas. Not just only the ruling,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:54.960
 temporary ruling. It rules everything. Samsara and nirvana. So we take care of our mind.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.480
 Then we are taking care of everything. If we take care of the mind perfectly,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.360
 then our generosity paramatta will come so beautifully. Our morality paramatta will come

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:17.600
 so beautifully. And our patient paramatta will come so beautifully. Now all will fall

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:26.880
 because of the mind. And therefore, mind is so important. For that reason, so many teachings,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:35.520
 what great comparison, the wise or the omniscient teacher, Buddha taught, really so many teachings,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.600
 everywhere, all the time, because it's so important. So, so, and therefore, again,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.720
 for that reason, this dhyana is that strictly directed. And in order to do dhyana, dhyana,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.680
 daily practice of concentration, the first, the most important is we have to be hermitage,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.560
 hermitage, our thought. In a hermitage, what any teaching says, we went through that,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:15.600
 there is true hermitage, the outer hermitage, inner hermitage, or physical hermitage and the

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:23.200
 mental hermitage. That's what we went through. And that order to highlight that, to bring that,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 great master Kamala Khyala highlighted those six points. We went those six points. I also listed

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:45.060
 yesterday to those names that you know. Those are the cause, conditions, supporters of to actual

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.760
izing

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:54.800
 our beautiful concentrations. Yeah, those six are, is a condensate or the elaborated way of the

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:06.400
 both hermitage, physical hermitage, mental hermitages, both. Now, above that, in the Mahayana

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:14.960
 teaching, said above that, hermitage from the self-important attitudes. That is the Mahayana's

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:23.520
 teaching. Both the dhyas is, is the old others are more important than our self. That's really the

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.400
 practice, actually, of them, both each other's, or both the self's. So therefore, in the teaching

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.720
 said,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:39.920
 the hermitage from the self-important minds, or in the Tibetan he said, "Rando Yibzike Tokwale Vem

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.000
ba"

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.920
 is hermitage from that. That, so that is really our will. When we are hermitage, our physical,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:56.480
 mentally those hermitage as women, but also same time, as much as we can do hermitage

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:07.360
 or retreat from self-important attitude, self-important as much as we can. That is both

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.040
 each other's activities. Now, what have to do with this? Now we're going to meditate.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.880
 A little meditate, I've already mentioned as Kamalachala, green mask Kamalachala dimension,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:28.080
 those six points. Then I went five obstacles, or the mistakes of the meditations. Then I went

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:37.360
 yesterday five supporters of the, support of five that will put a five, clear way of the five

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:44.720
 obstacles of meditation that I went yesterday. Listed those of one, up and others. I listed that.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:51.920
 This is not a amtoki, it is teachings. Teachings. That is the Buddha teaching.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.640
 That is the practice for all the great masters. Now, so that means everything is kind of organized,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:08.400
 allocated under our controls of the knowledges, or within our radar of the knowledges. Knowledge,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.640
 our understanding, now we begin to do the practices. Now we begin to do meditating.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:24.320
 Other to do meditation, they are always in the teaching set. Set, first we should deal with our

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:33.040
 bodies. Body is so important. Everything, body is related with the mind, the mind is related

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:46.080
 with body. They are in a way now, present time, interdependent. So, in a way, mind is, in a way,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:54.400
 residing with its body. Body is, in a way, a resident of the mind, or the house of the mind,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:03.920
 or the room of the mind. Body is. So therefore, there are strong such connections.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:12.400
 Connections. For that reason, in the teaching set, taking care of the body is so important,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.440
 or when we do the practices. What that means, taking care of the body, that means we should have

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:26.400
 beautiful, correct postures. Those are in the teaching set. Postures are so important.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:36.720
 One, how they say, they say, if body is balanced or straighted, our channels will be straighted.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:47.040
 When channels are straighted, our wind are straighted. When our windows are straighted,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:55.360
 our mind will be straighted, calmer, or straighted. In other words, if the body is balanced,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.760
 it will balance the channels, or the nervous systems. If the nervous systems are balanced,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:13.760
 it will help. Wind is balanced. The energy, our movement of the wind is balanced.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:21.920
 And when wind is balanced, mind will be balanced. When mind will be balanced,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:31.680
 it will bring clarity. Clarity of the mind. It will shine beautifully. So therefore,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.680
 they are all in a way connected, not in a way they are connected.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:46.800
 It is like interdependent co-ordination. They are all connected. So therefore, physical is very,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:56.480
 very important. In order to do that, in physical postures, very popular, renowned in the Buddha's

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:03.200
 teaching, it is called seven postures of the Buddha Veda Veda Kannas. That's the really teaching

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.680
 seven postures of the Buddha Veda Kannas. So I will list, of course, you all know this.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.280
 Basically, I will list that again. That's seven postures of the Buddha Veda Kannas.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:22.800
 And the postures in the teaching say, we should have nice cushions. Cushion, that is,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.200
 and where we're going to put our bottom, that side is a little higher, and where we're going

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:36.880
 to put the knees, that side is a little lower. So that means exactly the same as very standard,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:46.160
 popular, saffu, futons. Those are, I believe, the Japanese languages, those things. That is

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.200
 standard. So your body, that your, when you sit, our bottom is a little high, our front is lower,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.240
 lower. So that is a question. In the teaching say, it is square of the two elbows,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.200
 square of the two elbows. So that means about two pieces, or maybe two and a half pieces of the

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:14.000
 length that is square, and then put that something kind of small, something that was

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.200
 half, let it higher than futon, so that our body will become, when we sit down, sit down,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.560
 it will be, let it higher. So that is the cushion. Explain. Cushion, where you're going to stay.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:35.920
 And then, of course, this is, always in the teaching mentioned, is where you sit down on the,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.880
 on the floor. But somehow, of course, we have difficulty sitting on the floor,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.720
 due to our physical trouble. Then, of course, we can do, again, sitting on the chair there.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:54.480
 But I'm, I'm going to extend that instructions. So we can put sitting on the floor.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:02.080
 Once that happens, then, close the legs. Close the leg. That is true.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.560
 Vagal posture is completely crossed. You see the Buddha sitting on the lord's and sun and moon as

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.840
 cross, vagal cross. That is, so you, you know, that is vagal cross. But then it's semi-vagal

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:28.960
 cross, as we said, most of the time on the floor. That is semi-cross. Semi-vagal cross, cross legs.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.520
 So that is sitting on the cross leg is one of the seven postures of the Buddha Virajanis.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:50.960
 Once you sit there, in the back spines, straight up, straight up as arrows, or even sometimes heard

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:59.600
 as the conti-shell rings, as the ring of the conti-shell erector straight up. So back spines,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:11.920
 put straight up. That is second postures, postures. And third posture is extending the

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:22.880
 elbows or the shoulders, shoulders and elbows, extend this, extend this. So that is third.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:35.520
 Fourth is in palms held together right below neighbor centers. As you see meditation postures,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:44.160
 Buddhas or the Amitavas, you see that. That is known as economic motherhoods. Putting that.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:56.960
 And that is all, sometimes those great meditators do, both palms put on their knees. Not this way,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:04.880
 but palms don't work. And sitting, or back means both hands are up touching gestures.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:15.120
 As a great teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni, before his reaching enlightenment, he touched his

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:24.640
 right palms or right hand, toward the earth, known as earth-touching gestures. So both palms

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:32.320
 are earth-touching gestures. This is also known as, in the Nyingma teaching, many times mentioned,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:41.760
 relaxing mind, mother of the relaxing of the natural mother states. Many times we see

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:48.720
 the stage of kimba or the tankas are in that hand meditators. Relaxing

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:58.000
 mind, mother of the gesture of the relaxing mind and the natural states. So those are,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:12.480
 that is pith. And sixth is, pith is, and then the next are straight up, just slightly bending.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:23.040
 So that means what? It's not straight, not leaning backward, nor is kneeling like too much forward.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.720
 Just write a chord lined up with the spines. That is the pith.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:43.040
 Pith, sixth is, looking down toward the tip of nose, eyes are semi-closet or semi-open.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:57.120
 Opens. That is sixth posture. And then seventh posture is, moths are just naturally closest,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:04.400
 or just like lips are just touching naturally as it is, and the tip of the

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:15.360
 tongue are touching the upper root of the jaw. And it's really keep normal as it should be,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:25.040
 or as it's yours. Not yet. That is seventh posture of the Buddha Veda Jhana,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.840
 which is very popular in the Buddhism. And that is standing and stops us, too.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.640
 Also, in the teaching method, this is the extraordinary postures of the Buddha teachers,

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:48.480
 Buddhism. It's the basic foundation of all the, basic foundation of the posture of all the,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:56.560
 those tumma and yoga practice of the inner centers. This is what really all started. That's what it

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:56.720
 is.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:05.600
 So now what it does? In the teaching said, it will balance everything. It will balance,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:14.000
 as I already said, channels. Channels keep normal positions as it should be. Should be.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.560
 Just natural positions. And then because of that, it will affect immediately the energy or the wind

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:33.120
 will be very, very balanced. Naturally. And wind is very much control of all our systems.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:42.320
 In the teaching said, it has many aspects of the wind, related with four or five winds,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:52.960
 related with five elements. So it will balance all those element-bound winds, the moving force of

00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:01.840
 the elements, of the physicals. When that happens, mind will be balanced. Mind will become more

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.560
 calm,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.280
 peaceful. That what does in the teaching said, it will immediately help to reduce the strength and

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:18.960
 turbulence of the conceptions or the emotions. Emotions are five negative emotions. The enduring

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:29.520
 emotions, attachment emotions, anger emotions, jealous emotions, arrogance emotions. It really

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:37.680
 will balance the teaching. It will subside them. With that subside, whatever does, the wisdom,

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:45.600
 the hidden quality of the nature of the mind will shine so beautifully, so nicely. Also,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.920
 it will bring more clarity in the mind. Because of that clarity, less kind of turbulence of the

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:59.520
 meditations. So it really will break, so that it will breathe calm and peaceful steps. So that is

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:07.600
 really the postures in the teaching said. That is, whenever you have physical troubles sitting on

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:07.760
 the

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.880
 floor, on the cushions or the cross legs, sitting on the chairs. Sitting on the chair, as many of

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.120
 us

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:25.330
 do, do. But trying to keep the rest of the postures as the seven postures. So that means six post

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:25.680
ures,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:35.200
 or seven, five postures. Trying to keep that. That postures. So that is, in the teaching what

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:45.280
 is said, when you sit down, sit. What is important? What is important? No uncomfortable. In the

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.760
 teaching

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:53.760
 said, when you sit down on the cushion, cushion the three principles. Principles, comfortable,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:04.480
 spaciousness, and relax. That is three principles of the way you sit down, or in the cross legs

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.800
 with

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:17.890
 seven postures. Comfortable, spaciousness, spaciousness, and relax. Relax that med, relax all our

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:18.320
 bodies.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:27.520
 Relax our muscles. Relax our chin, and it's just kind of, just so become as gentle in peace,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:36.000
 as it should be. More just as everything kind of flows. It's only, all everything is kind of

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.560
 felt down in its own sports. There's no tensions. No kind of like postures, all that. So those are

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:56.320
 three principles, principles. We call it where we are, have good sitting on the postures, seven

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:03.040
 postures of the Buddha where we are with others. So that is really the physical way there. Now,

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:11.600
 when we sit down, now what we do? Now that means, that in the teaching said, both we should really

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:20.560
 bring up, what's called, bring up if you know, you know, do those breathing, that breathing

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:28.320
 purificatory exercise. If you know, if you receive instructions, breathing purificatory exercise.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:39.060
 And that is, somehow if those don't know, in the teaching also said, the simplest one is exhale,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:39.200
 exhale.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:52.320
 Do three times. Exhale, that air is coming from the mouth, as well as to nostrils.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:26:01.200
 Just three times. Very gently. Inhale gently, and exhale gently.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.720
 Many times in the teaching also said, when you exhale, don't have to open mouth widely.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:20.880
 Keep normal, simple way, and in exhale very gently. When you do that, what is concentration?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:29.840
 I'm talking simple ones. You need more instructions. Many of you know, you can do those too.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:39.370
 And now, as I'm saying this, it's just the simplest way. Two, just like three, exhale, slowly,

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:40.400
 gentle,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:49.840
 that. So that means, you're not sending, breathing, exhale, immediately, stop. Gently exhale.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:02.640
 So three, in the teaching, what I said, when you do this exhales, what is concentration?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:10.080
 Many take in the teaching said, so that you're releasing all the bad energies,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:21.360
 bad energies, negativities, obscurations, disease, sicknesses, broken samayas, broken commitments.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:30.400
 Any day that we can happen, not just only now or this lifetime, but from the biggest times,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.800
 those all kind of like negativities, obscurations, obstacles,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:44.800
 breaking samayas, breaking commitments, that means breaking vows, any negativities,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:55.280
 that all this is really went out and went out completely, clayed away, completely out.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:08.560
 Do that three times. I say, gently that. Once that you don't, now is time to bring up the great

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:19.520
 devotions. As I said many times, and you all know that, devotion is the sunlight to grow,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:28.960
 the result of the fruit. Also devotion is not just sunlight, but devotion is sunlight

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:37.680
 together with miracle glows. It is, if you add miracle glows with sunlight, just a moment of that,

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:47.200
 really then it will boost. Feel precious, feel happy, what devotees, happy, joy,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.520
 appreciation, precious feelings. As I said the other day, and you all know, I mean it's not

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.880
 something I say that, feel precious, the lineage is precious, teachings are precious, situation

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:08.560
 is precious, circumstances are precious, and life is precious, time is precious.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:15.600
 This is not just talking, it's true, you think, not kind of talking and believing, believing,

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:24.960
 nothing like that, isn't it? All these precious things are together with us, our sight,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:35.840
 our favor, how fortunate, how wonderful, how beautiful, what glorious time we have,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:47.920
 what beautiful time we have, really feel happy, kind of deep of happy and joy, joy. Then feel the

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:55.540
 presence of your teaching, any teaching said that, but if you particularly don't have teaching,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:55.920
 feel

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:05.120
 Buddha Shatyamuni. Buddha Shatyamuni is our teacher. Oh, Guropeyama Sambhava. Guropeyama Sambhava

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.840
 is

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:15.040
 embodiment, it shows all the teachers of the past, present, and futures. Everything comes

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:24.160
 together as one single state, as Guropeyama Sambhava. All the past Buddha, all the present Buddha,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.920
 and all the future Buddha. And the Buddha's notice that lineage master, all that come together in

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:39.360
 one single state as Guropeyama Sambhava, that is right in front of our space, your spaces,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:48.160
 spaces, and the rainbow body, Hong Kong rainbow body, and we act, the all the college of the

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:56.000
 Buddha's complete, what are those qualities, power of the compassion, power of love, power of

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.560
 kindness,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:04.480
 power of the wisdom, that all combined together, in the form of Guropeyama Sambhava.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:15.520
 If it is right in front of us, as rainbow body, and looking to us with eye of love and compassion,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:23.600
 concerning, caring, and welcoming thoughts. In front of that, again, feel precious,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.000
 happy, and joy. How wonderful, how beautiful. Really, if you're sizzling devotion,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:40.880
 the sizzling devotion, illuminating joy and devotions, bring up that. As I said, and you all know,

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:49.520
 with all the devotions, realization, not world bloom, easy. It's really in the teaching set.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:57.680
 And witnessed by all those great masters, read life stories. With all devotion means we don't

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:05.760
 have too much appreciations. We are kind of in skeptical words, dark and hesitation. That is world

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:14.320
 of duality, world of ego cleanliness. Have I used another word, world of darkness? There is hardly

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:25.120
 light or shine, easy. It's dark, cold, ice, and gets twisted. And then it becomes darker and

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:36.320
 darker. But when you have the devotions, eliminating everything, and lighten up our self, then it's

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:43.920
 really beginning to grow. All that. So therefore, with beautiful thought, and then do the calling

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:53.280
 lama pass. And if you don't know the calling lama pass, just feel that. The gracious teacher,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:33:02.880
 or the Guru Pima Sambha, you who embodies all the buddhas and dharmas and sangas and enlightenings.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:11.360
 That you can embody, embody with all the kindness of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, enlightenings,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.800
 leading account, masters, came to get it. I pray to you. May I have the perfect realization

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.000
 of the Viva Shana in the Shama meditation. May I have the perfect realization of the

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.800
 pre-opera, the beginning of the Zogchik 2 realizations. May I have the perfect realization

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.280
 of the subcontinent living of the Thoggar realizations. May I reach enlightenment within

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:45.760
 this lifetime in order to benefit for all living beings. Really sincerely, openly, yearning,

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.160
 looningly. Pray. You are now, we are developing spiritual realizations.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:59.680
 We are different realizations. We are not lingering in stock with the samsara-nautilus.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:09.680
 We are opening ourselves. We are breaking down the barriers of the ego-clinging, self-importance,

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:17.840
 mingling with ourselves with leading masters and bodhisattvas. As we talk about bodhisattvas,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.160
 we say, "I follow you, Buddha and bodhisattvas. Whatever you did, I will do."

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.840
 That was really we said. That was we said yesterday three times. For example,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:41.040
 maybe we talked about renewing our bodhisattvas. Today, we are, or each session when you do the

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:48.800
 meditation, you're renewing that. Reactivating that. Rewatering, you're taking care of your

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:57.520
 blend of bodhisattvas. But what we saw to target us, or you saw. That is what it is.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.880
 Really with praise. And then when we do those of praise, and blessings are coming,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:09.280
 sunlight of the blessings of the Gurbayama from Gurbayama sambhava, in the form of many lights,

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:16.560
 white light, red light, red, blue, green, multiple lights, and beings of light to you and to all

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:16.720
 the

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:26.000
 beings. Completely blessed. And finally, Gurbayama sambhava dissolved that into light

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:35.120
 and moved to your mind. And relaxing in that status for short times, or whatever your times.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:42.400
 Then, if you have the brave book, kind, there is Mundo praise, poor, boneless praise.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:51.360
 So, poor, non-sessions, praise. As his only union with teaching, as like short Mundo, which is so

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:59.280
 condensate, condensate praise. What if I can't directly translate it into English? What is it?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:05.920
 It's translated beautiful in that. Said, impalatable, lama, you who knows.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:14.000
 The favorable conditions in the body is too difficult to obtain, but I got.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.280
 That is really what's said. Even though they did not say, the favorable condition of human

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.640
 birth is too difficult to obtain, but I got, what I got, I'm adding. But it's true, we got.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:37.520
 Even though it's so difficult, we got. Good. But everything is bound to die.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:44.960
 Everything is permanent, impalatable, bound to die. But I am still light. How precious.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:54.720
 How beautiful it is. And all the cause and effect, the cause and effect are inevitable.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:01.280
 Or the resolve is inevitable. I'm going to follow with that, understand.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:10.320
 We did confirmation with that. And the samsara has a lot of difficulties, challenges. But I'm going

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.640
 to

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:22.240
 learn, grow from these challenges. It is my joy to walk in samsara because I taught the body to

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:28.320
 the values, what is to benefit all the sentient beings. And the teaching said, what great master

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:38.320
 Chandideva said, as long as samsara existed, may I remain that long in samsara and benefit for all

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:46.080
 the living beings. May that I remain. And in the teaching said, also said, when you remain in the

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:53.590
 samsara, when you have the great bodhicata in your heart and mind, you're not going to feel any

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.240
 pains

00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:02.080
 or sufferings because your marital activity will keep so strong your vitality of the body.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:10.480
 Your realization of the understanding of the absolute truth will become so vastly big, there is

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:18.800
 no sufferings. Sufferings are transformed into great blessings. So therefore, even you see in the

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:28.480
 samsara, when you have that realization, but that attitude in your mind, it is going from garden to

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:37.920
 garden, up from park to park. It is wonderful. So who will be tired and bold to benefit all the

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:46.000
 sentient beings? Since there is so much benefit and so much resolve, so many good things happening.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.680
 That's really the teaching said that. So that dows are the relief. We don't talk, this whole

00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:03.760
 renunciation of thought is the anchor of the practices, anchor practices. But in the teaching

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:13.200
 said that devotion is the head of the mid practices. Head, head, but four renunciation,

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:20.880
 four is the anchor of the practices, anchor of the meditation. What it does, when you have that

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:28.960
 devotion in the four renunciation report, it will keep our self more gentle, peaceful, more

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.760
 practical.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:36.720
 Don't move to the earth. We're not caring why the ego clings, self-important, those like,

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:44.000
 they are those arrogance. Become humble, simple, more practical, more common sense.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:55.120
 Truly we can mingle with our fellow sentient beings, beings, and also blend in. That is what

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:03.040
 great teacher is, great teacher, Buddha Heptaman taught. With that, then those four, those, and

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:12.000
 then after that, then do the meditation. Then do the meditation of the Chama the meditation,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.560
 and Vibhachana meditation, or meditations. And apply those, what I listed, those,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:29.360
 avoiding those five obstacles, and use the antidote of those five supports. Why I list it,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:37.120
 list it, that we went through those. Then practice, so relax. Bring up the occasionally,

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:45.200
 bring up more joy, more appreciations, more bodhicitta, more devotions. Go on, and on.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:52.480
 Then we are developing, we are advancing, we are really flying on the vastness of the Dharma.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:00.320
 What is the benefit of all the living beings? That is known as really practicing of the Dharma,

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:06.400
 and practice of the bodhicitta activities. And of course, I go let more details, of course,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.720
 you all know that, but I go those, there are more details of the concentrations.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:18.080
 Meditations, again, to continue tomorrow, we go all the way. Thank you very much, again,

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.720
 for your own participation, and thank you very, very much to everyone. Thank you.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:31.040
 And now, we begin our healing practices.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.520
 And we will begin our practice.
