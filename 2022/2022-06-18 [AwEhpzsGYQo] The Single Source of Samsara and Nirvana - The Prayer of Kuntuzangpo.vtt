00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 The prayer is the same, because even though it is the same, due to our mishandling, then it went

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.940
 two directions.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.980
 And then because of the two directions, then we got two different results.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 But the reality is the same, there is no different sources.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:33.240
 And that is now how this is done. Again, this is generally the Dzogchen teaching, or universal

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.980
 teaching, always that we learned, we heard that so many times.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 What is this? This is the ordinary nature. What is that nature?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 The jjic, the one source. What is the one source? This one source is a commonly gendered Dzogchen,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.980
 generally Buddha teaching, or Mahayan teaching, as well as Vedayan teaching.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 This is known as the ordinary nature, or absolute nature, or it is tathangatagarbha, Buddha nature.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:22.560
 And the luminosity status, or absolute alaya, ordinal alaya, this is what is the condition, that is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.980
 one source.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:36.670
 What the great Mahasma Kumbh Kumbha says, and this ordinary nature is the absolute alaya, is a clay

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.980
 luminosity status.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 Status, there is no even names of the samsara, nirvanas.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:53.440
 But however, due to the duality of the Muslim handling, then duality arises from that ordinary

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.980
 nature of our own basic mind.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:08.440
 Duality is like as a clodus in the sky, even though the clodus is not connected to the sky or is

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.980
 not clearly touched, is not glued, but it covered.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 Then similarly, the duality clodus is covered in the ordinary nature of this one soul.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 That one soul is completely covered.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 When it is covered, what is duality? Then duality is the beginning of all these obscurations.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 Or in the Buddha teaching, it generates Buddha teaching, very big in the Buddha teaching.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:55.820
 That is then, from duality, arises all these cause of suffering truths, negative emotions, all that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.980
 arises.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.820
 Negative emotions, I mean it is explained in the letter so many times, all those negative emotions,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.980
 anger and guilt.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.450
 This between clodus of these things, then we create more clodus and more mist in the rain and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.980
 thunderstorms of the karmas.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.150
 And those each karmas again become back and forth, then it can support each other as known as in

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.980
 the general Buddha teaching, interdependent coordination.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.170
 Interconnected, all supporting each other, maintaining each other, produce the kind of support,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.980
 then continue to accelerate and fundamental that all cause,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.980
 each of those causes are connected with dualities, all duality or the ignored minds.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:52.520
 Then this in the teaching said here, so here, "Konasinkunde", all these samsara and nirvana are

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.980
 done then.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.980
 So they are same. Then part is two parts. One is a deluded part, one is an undeluded part.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.190
 Part of the delusion is known as then all these negative emotions, the rasping, clinging, negative

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.980
 emotions, and that change.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:21.130
 And then the part of the non-delusion is then, as we talk, joy, appreciation, love and compassion,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.980
 both each other.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.980
 And realization of emptiness, nature of love, are part of the undelusions, delusions.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.400
 And then we continue to follow with that, that if we follow the delusion, there is no end of sams

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.980
ara.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.980
 In this teaching said here too, on the praise, there is no end of samsara, it's continuing.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.980
 It started the delusion, but the delusion never ends.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.810
 And because we maintain it, even though we have not had intentionally maintained it, but we have

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.980
 unintentionally maintained it

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:05.420
 with the grasping, clinging, and rejection and acceptance, this and that, all that, then we

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.980
 maintain it

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:14.640
 and create all the samsara necessity, samsara code, samsara condition, and it is a result, it is

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.980
 going on and on.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:25.110
 There is no end. And we can go to the fact that nature undilute the way, joy, appreciation, love

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.980
 and kindness, compassion,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:35.580
 and non-detachment, all the emptiness, realization, then it brings all again, then developing all

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.980
 the nirvana parts,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.980
 all the enlightened parts, those five parts, ten bhimmis, one after another, it comes.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.030
 So those are the summary, but of course, it is explaining more detail in the attitude, more detail

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.980
 in this.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.980
 Yes. And the right which you want to go to.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.980
 So therefore, I, Kondharsanku, Buddha Kondharsanku, pray, may everyone reach the enlightenment.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.740
 Everyone got the realization of the true nature, as valid as it is, and it liberated all the dual

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.980
ity of consumption,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.980
 and we get enlightenment within the Dharmakaya status. And which is, I should look here.
