00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 You've been talking throughout the retreat about the four thoughts that turn the mind to the Dharma

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.680
.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 What?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.720
 You've been talking about the four thoughts that turn the mind to the Dharma.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.120
 Oh yeah I am!

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:26.880
 And so, is it when your mind has turned to the Dharma, is that when the change from ordinary being

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.920
 to noble being is taking place?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.800
 Yeah, that will really lead, it will lead to the ordinary being to the noble beings.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 Definitely it will lead this.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.280
 But when our mind has changed to Dharma, Dharma, what that really actually means.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.130
 Because when we are reflecting those four thoughts, the first one, "Priches the Beauty of Thy Life"

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 and in "Vamana",

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.880
 it will, this life will become very precious.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.360
 Precious, and this situation, everything becomes really precious, everything is really careful.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 Life is precious, and it is just also precious, and time is very precious, and gathering and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.960
 apprenticeship is very important.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 So therefore, our mind becomes more mindfulness, and we won't spoil our time and our situation, so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.880
 it becomes more practical.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 Practical, and that is also really noble, when we do that, it is noble.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.040
 Our life will be more happier, more peaceful, more fulfilment, and less disappointments.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 And then samsara, when we reflect of the samsara, in the teaching said, what we see, so that will

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.640
 understand.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.040
 All this samsara is not just, when we have the troubles, when we have the difficulties,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.920
 that we are not completely tormented with that, because this is the energy of samsara.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.840
 Samsara, I mean samsara, this is one of my, part of my, this way, when I'm here.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.510
 And therefore, I'm not going to, too much kind of carry by with that, I'm going to get more courage

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.760
, and become strong,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.430
 and I'm going to, that I'm not going to pick kind of bodies with this, and really be stronger, and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.440
 more courageous,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.960
 and you, in the teaching said, you begin to think of the, of the how come out of this, this.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.630
 So that is also, you become, then begin to do some practices, a meditation, or good things to do

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 yourself.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
 And then, when you think the karma things, when you reflect on the karma, then it will help.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.560
 If we really have that thought, our actions, our intention will become more pure, more mindfulness.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 We don't kind of like, always many times, be some sort of beings, or we think that, oh, I don't

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.800
 care,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 I don't want, I don't care, if it's good for me, I'm going to do this and that thing.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.680
 But even it is good for your time, for those individually, when they do something,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 but the consecration is not going to say that, oh, that's okay for you.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.560
 Consecration will come strongly to that, according to the teaching.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.920
 So therefore, the actions and all the activities will become that more mindfulness, our activities.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.240
 So everyone kind of without any mindfulness, we won't believe any kind of unbeneficial activities

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.040
 too much.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.840
 So therefore, when we start doing those things, then that is called turning your mind to the dharma

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.840
.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 Dharma and dharma, and then you become more kinder, softer, practical.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.960
 And then, when you practice it continually, you do that, and then you become noble too, definitely,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.800
 and that goes into dharma.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 Thank you.
