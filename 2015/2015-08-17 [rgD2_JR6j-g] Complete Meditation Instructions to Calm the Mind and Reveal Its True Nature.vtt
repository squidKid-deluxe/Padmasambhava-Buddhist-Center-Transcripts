00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The visualization practices and the completion stage practices. Both are equally important.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.360
 The visualization practices are the starting practices with the poem and the song and then go to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000
 the nature of the mind, not the mind.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.800
 So it is in a way embracing whole things, bring out everything as an enlightened status. Because

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.000
 there is, in the phenomenon of all, there is three things, poem, song and the space of the mind.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.250
 The visualization practices start with the poem, the poem and the song, then it captures the mind

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.000
 and the whole thing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.610
 So that is known as the visualization practices in the Vedayana teachings. The completion stage

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.400
 practices, of course there are two things, but if you talk about the completion stage, the final

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.770
 completion stage is practicing on the mind, the nature of the mind, completely in a great emptiness

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.000
, all great, natural, absolute state.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.920
 And the practice of that, and then again coming out, understanding the song and the poem, again,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 same thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.010
 One is directed on the front, on the spotlight, other is coming from the emptiness, emptiness to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.000
 the poem.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.640
 And one is going from the poem to the emptiness or the absolute state. It is basically two

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.000
 approaches.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And now we begin to talk about this completion stage, great completion stage.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 So that means to the absolute stage. To do the absolute practices and then the greatest teacher,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.000
 Bodhakshatyamuni, gave two instructions, two hymns and stockings.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.740
 Those are known as the samatha practices and vivashana practices, these two practices, samatha and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.000
 vivashanas.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And that means, actually, who is going to practice? Who is going to discover these natures?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Nature as it is, with all the continually, kind of like, acting disturbed by the dualities.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Who is going to do? It is mind. Mind is going to practice. Our mind.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So therefore, chamatha is completely designed through stabilizing our mind.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.690
 Our mind. That also means, of course, we all know ourselves. It is not something mystery to each of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.000
 us.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Our mind is very active. And if I use the word active, if I use another word, it is restless.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Mind is restless all the time. Time will wake up early in the morning until we fall asleep.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 It is active all the time. Active or restless. All the time.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.700
 And then, when we fall asleep, also unless we fall deep sleep, otherwise our mind is active as a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.000
 dream walk.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 So virtually, if I speak in almost 20 hours, our mind is active or restless.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.560
 This is what the Buddha teaching said. It is like turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence is going on

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 all the time.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 When the turbulence of the mind is going on, what is it doing? It is not just the only mind alone.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.350
 Our channels are active. Our breathings are active. Our physicals are active. Our energies are so

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.000
 restless.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 When it becomes so strong and so tense, then we can begin problems such as psychological problems,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 mental problems, emotional problems. Those are reflective and then physically begin to change too.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Shape and formation, complexion, all that change. Because mind is so restless, all those turbulence

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 are going on like that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And when that happens, what is our mind? We are not in peace. We are not in rest for status.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 We are not in calm and peaceful. Completely on the surface, we are wandering.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.210
 Our mind, our space, our physical universe or the world is in a way completely covered of the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.000
 hurricane or the cyclone

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 or these tropical depressions on the surface. There is nothing really coming up out of the shining

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 sun, sunshine of the nature.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It is completely disturbed. Even things externally look good. Everything looks good.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.810
 Luxury is rich and famous. Wellness, all these things. But mind is not rest. It just doesn't make

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.000
 any big difference.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 It just rest. That is how the mind is. That is opposite of the shamatha.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Shamatha means what? Calmly abiding. Now, when mind is that status, it is not calmly abiding.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 It is turbulence abiding. Total turbulence abiding. That is how mind is.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And then what will I use? Drunk monkey mind. Drunk, not just a monkey mind, drunk mind.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Or drunk elephant mind. That is how it is. And then we really don't have any fears.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 For that reason, shamatha is important. You should do the shamatha.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.130
 Shamatha is also what in the teaching, every great master says, everyone says, in the Buddha says,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.000
 again and again,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.560
 with all the shamatha meditation, we won't get realizations. That means mind is not rested. Not

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.000
 rested.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.290
 So therefore, good shamatha is really foundation of all the realizations. So for that reason, again

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.000
, I'm going to really avoid shamatha.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.560
 Shamatha, many of you know already all these things, but however, again, as I said yesterday, those

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.000
 who know is reminded to each other,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.050
 is reminded from me and reminded to you. And those who don't know, it is important. As is already,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.000
 I succeed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.590
 Now, when you come out of meditation, again, physical posture is the same thing as I said yesterday

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.000
.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.290
 Regular postures or seven postures, or whatever comfortable you are going to sit on the cushion or

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.000
 the floor, be comfortable.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And what is, again, in the teaching, I said yesterday too, when you ask what is important,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.460
 when you meditate in physical level, comfortable, relaxed, spacious, kind of feel comfortable, feel

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.000
 very relaxed, that is what we need.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.010
 And when you do that, it will balance our body, and then balance that energy, balance the mind,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.000
 those all I see.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And then you did, again, we did all this devotion and praise, and all this reflecting mind, all

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And now, when you come to the practice itself, the shamatha itself, there is two shamathas.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.700
 And there is many shamathas. Buddha gives so many instructions about the shamatha, a variety of the

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.000
 techniques of the shamatha.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Cheating Buddha gives, but I am going to talk to you about Jainakar, two systems of shamatha.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.710
 After, shamatha that use the support from outer object, outside, shamatha that use the support from

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.000
 inside.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 That means outside our physical, and then inside our body.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And that also divided into two.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.510
 According to the instructions of the great master woman Madhana, and our kettipadishya also said in

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.000
 a minute time.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 There is that outer can be, so you can be divided into two.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And that is, the first one is the holy object, and only the objects.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And only the object, just whatever you feel you like to use as support of your folks.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It is small marbles, or crystals, or something kind of kitschy, small things.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Small things that you will put right in front of your distance.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Again, in the Buddha teaching, mentioned distance of the one york. Y-O-R-K. Right?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:22.280
 York. Y-O-K-E. Y-O-K-E. Y-O-K-E. One york. Distance of one york, and cut off on your front, and

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.000
 looking towards the tip of the nose, as I said, yes sir.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Looking at it. And that is the only object for the support.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 This is the support for the chamata support.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And the holy object as statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Small Buddha Shakyamuni statue, also the same distance. One york distance.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.990
 And there is on a small table, you put that Buddha, or small cushion, nice cushion. On the top of

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.000
 that, you put the Buddha statue.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.180
 So now, whether it is a holy object, or a regular object, only an object, both are supported for

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.000
 the Chamata meditations.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Chamata meditations.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.780
 This object, what it will do, as I used already, is support. It will support to stabilizing our

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.000
 running, trouble-less mind.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.570
 It will support. It will kind of affect the use of the word. It will anchor down our mind. It will

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.000
 help to anchor down our mind.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.290
 Now, with that meaning, when you put that Buddha statue or just a regular object, now you are going

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.000
 to concentrate that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 And how? You are going to brain in a way your mind, not in a way, brain-mind to the two eyes.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Focus up to the two eyes, and now two eyes, semi-open, looking to that object.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 It is the piece of marble, or the Buddha.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Every Buddha looks to the third eye spot of Buddha.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.840
 Hence, the person with the Buddha, particularly third eye spot of the Buddha, you are going to look

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.000
.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.220
 So that means, you are now really, in a way, created in a triangle, in a way, triangle from where

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.000
 you put the eyes, both eyes, looking.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.920
 The mind is coming, and looking at the triangle, and pointed, and now you are looking to the third

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.000
 eye spot of the Buddha Chakra meditations.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Buddha Chakra meditations.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And do that with a little bit, kind of, strongly. Concentrate it, that means.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Strongly concentrate, you are going to look to that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.430
 And my mind is with the eye, and I is with both eyes, I to the support of the Buddha, the Buddha's

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.000
 third eye.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And it is that. Concentrate on that. Concentrate.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 That means, when you use the word concentration, I think, in the head, that.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 That means, some kind of, some duty of the strength.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Strength that you are going to use. Concentrate.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 In a debate, not as ting yin zi, ting yin zi, means concentrate.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Stay forward, upholding that concentration. Concentrate.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And see how long your mind stays with that third eye spot of the Buddha's Chakra meditations.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 That how long?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 That means, this time, you are not letting go of mind to any of the places.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 As we said yesterday, mind is not going in the past memories.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Mind is not broken in the future plans.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Mind is not wandering now, any places. Just only that.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.570
 Every your concentration of the past, the present, the future, come together, one single state to

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.000
 that sport.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Be kind of vigilantly concentrating to that sport.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 How long are we can keep concentrating without mind went away, or without monkey mind went away?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And we can keep that in the first, maybe, one minute.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Minute. That is good, actually. It's nothing wrong.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It's one minute. We really can keep that.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And we can keep two minutes, or one and a half minutes, two minutes, three minutes.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 That is not stabilizing the concentration. It's called stabilizing.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 It is now stabilizing. Stabilizing.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And while you meditate that, and our monkey mind becomes even at the beginning time.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Those who did long meditation, different.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 But if it's big in meditation, even it won't stay one minute.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 It looks like mind is more active than ever.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Ever. It looks so restless. You will feel that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 This is the teaching said, it's not mind is restless more active now, but now you are seeing that.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Before we don't notice that, we just always think that's it, we don't notice at all.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Now our mind, we are putting in a rare sports. rare sports.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 So you see, you detect more clearly that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Which means good in this case. You recognize how mind is active, that.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 But without a tired, without a bored, or any question, this and why, this and that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And if we do those questions only, then we are making more mind, more restless mind.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 That is not so compact. Without question, anything just comes again.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Again. On that sports. Do that again and again.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And every can stay that mind for five minutes, which is really wonderful and very good.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.560
 Or while you are doing this, while you are concentrating, maybe you can also occur at zoky level,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.000
 you can start joining us.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Concentrating mind to that and sometimes joining us so softly, just so softly.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And see how long you can hold. And I, you start counting, counting.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 We don't again focus on that, counting with the fingers.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Each finger has three lines, lines. And you start counting it up, one feet.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Just very softly. Only you, who will hear it up, you will hear it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 No one else, not anybody must hear it. But count.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And you can do 50, that means five, up to 50. That means 50 times up.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 That means more than 20 seconds, or maybe more than that, in mind state.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.560
 So that means you are using the object, supporting to our causes, object at the same time we are

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.000
 using cigarette syllables.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Blessings. Bless cigarette syllables that we are using.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 That is what we put. That is what we call meditating on the outer support of the object.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 External object. Object. Whether it is holy or whether it is only.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Inwardly support again. Now there is not any external outside, but same thing.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.870
 Again, holy object and a regular again. Regular or both, maybe according to Zouki level, both are

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.000
 now holy objects.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Inwardly, according to the great master Gomar Matar teaching, and Kenki Patishan, many times say,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 and we have legalized, again, inwardly, in our heart center.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Small Buddha. Totally, absolutely, of course, Buddha is totally enlightened.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 It is transcendental vs. run body. Buddha. That's the concentration of the Buddha.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Small Buddha, one type, size of thumbs, like this, just small, the glowing Buddha, this, this size.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 So that means maybe three inches, or two inches. Just this. One of these. One inch.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 One inch. One inch. One inch. One inch is small, even smaller.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 But just part of the proportion, part of the glowing, part of the radiating light,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 just so calm, so peaceful, and full of love, that's what the Buddha is.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And just meditating, meditating inwardly to that, and concentrate on that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That is, then same thing, how long our mind is.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And then another one is, again, it's similar things.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 According to the Zouki level, or not more, in the Zouki teaching,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 and that great master, his whole religion, we measure.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Visualizing right here, Tadaisport, small light, small glowing white light here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Inside white light, small white R, small white R.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 R is A, H, R, I think, maybe, or very R, either one.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 But very small and glowing, glowing, glowing, and concentrating.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Again, you can close eyes, need it, close eyes, and concentrate on that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 And again, how long your mind can stay, stay, and use those supports.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Once your mind is more stabilized that way, and then release all those objects,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 focus outside, inner things, and just relax neutral steps.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 We don't, again, say anything, no past, no future, no present thoughts,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 or wonder anyway, just simply relax.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Relaxing calm and peaceful. Peaceful.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 This is how we begin the meditation.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Meditation, that is how we need the foundation of the meditation.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And this is the meditation, it's then, again, so powerful, so special.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 It will help to increase our understanding of knowledge, wisdom, of wisdom,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 and our love, and our compassion.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Also, it will increase more patience, more kind of skills and methods.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And the benefit of the meditation is so, in there, it will bring more mindfulness,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 more alertness, it will bring all those beautiful things.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 The benefits are by meditation, by Mother Chagimani, all those great masters.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Man can do so many times again, and again, and again.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 This is not just the meditation, but in the modern time,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 now we see, even in the mainstream of the United States,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 meditation of the mind is become so popular here, so popular.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Maybe ten years ago, during meditation, maybe they don't like to hear their names,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 it helps them out, strange things, it makes more sense.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Now it becomes more popular, because of the benefit of the meditation,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 our mindfulness, that's really how it is.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 So this is the foundation of the meditation.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 It is really important.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Even when you do the Dokkin meditation, before the Dokkin meditation,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 or in one second, one second, have this meditation for at least five minutes,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 or two minutes, three minutes, stabilize the mind.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Then Dokkin meditation, then it is good.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 So that is my breathing about the Shammatas.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Now we try to start with our Dokkin meditation,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 because otherwise I won't be in trouble like that.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 What happens with Dokkin teaching or something?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 So now I will do Dokkin teaching.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Now with that foundation, Dokkin teaching, now we begin to practice.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And this is an instruction according to these teachings.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 This is really teaching, this is Dokkin teaching.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 But now we are talking about Dokkin.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Dokkin has two famous practices, many of you know it,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 not just many of you.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Most all of you know this.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 It is known as Tukkyu and Togga practices.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And Tukkyu and Togga both are very important.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Those are so special, because why it is important is the essence of nature where things are.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Exactly.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 And it is not that this Dokkin practice is exactly what the Buddha realized,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 what the Buddha achieved.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 When you become the Buddha, what do you rely on?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 You usually rely on Dokkin, Dokkin realization.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 That is what it is.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So it is the essence of the practice, or essence of realization.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 This is the Dokkin teaching.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Now Dokkin teaching, when you do practices,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 again it needs all that foundation.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Without those foundation, what I said yesterday, what I said today,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 without that, we won't really act well in that.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 This is what I said yesterday, and today this is your mother.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 All those are, in a way, what we call, in a way, lunch bed, lunch bed, lunch bed.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 When you go to the space shuttle challenges, challenges, space shuttle challenges,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 space shuttle, the challenge is so famous, so powerful, so famous,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 but without lunch bed, bed, it won't go.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 It won't make you powerful.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 What I said today and yesterday is like lunch bed, lunch bed.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Without that, it won't achieve.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 The goal, what we want.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 We have this lunch bed.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Then we can get really Dokkin practicing, nicely, perfectly.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Perfect, it is powerful.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Now, when you practice Dokkin, Dokkin, again, Dokkin practices how you are going to practice.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 This is, again, in a Dokkin teaching, every great master says it.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Now, Dokkin practices, Dokkin teaching is the same as I have used terminology,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 what the Buddha, generally the Buddha teaches.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Samad meditation and Vipassana meditation, these two meditations.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Samad meditation, we discussed.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Now, Vipassana meditation.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Vipassana meditation and Dokkin meditation is the same.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 This is Vipassana meditation.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Dokkin is Vipassana meditation.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Vipassana meditation, generally, what do you do?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 What do you do?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 You see everything exactly where things are.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Where things are, according to teaching, according to those great masters,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 where things are is emptiness.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Everything is emptiness.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Everything is emptiness, but it is also poem.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 That's what in the heart of Sotar we write.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Poem is emptiness, emptiness is poem.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 When you see that exactly as it is, poem is emptiness,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 emptiness is the poem, that is realization of the Vipassana.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Perfect, exactly.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 But how we start to realize that nature immediately?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Because our duality mind is so strong,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 immediately we won't see poem is emptiness.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 We won't see.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 That's what we are.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Maybe we start to question why are these poems?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Because our habit better grasping is so strong.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 It is accumulated or kind of added up from the beginning is so strong,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 our understanding is tangible, solid, existing and conquered that things.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 That is duality.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Reality, poem is emptiness.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 Now to discover that both poem, emptiness, emptiness is a poem,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 we started with meditating, we started from emptiness.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So we started emptiness, meditation.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Emptiness, as again many times every great master said,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 and Kinti Parnejana, we said many times, emptiness is not negation status.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Negation is the poem.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 That's what Buddha said, emptiness is the poem.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Poem is the emptiness, emptiness is no other than the poem.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Poem is no other than the emptiness.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Also what Buddha used the back and forth of that.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Bring up this total nature status.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 But as I said, we started to kind of to begin to discover the nature of that exile.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 So we started with the realization of the emptiness.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 And also to start an emptiness realization from outside, object is difficult to us.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Again, to encounter, digest is difficult, understand is difficult.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 So we start to go to the heart of the nature.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 That's what the Dho Chititi is, going to the heart of the nature.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Nature, who is going to realize this nature, emptiness or not emptiness?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Who is doing this? All analyzation. Who is doing this?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Who is making all this? This is not emptiness, yes, emptiness.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 This might be this, all this. Who is doing this?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Every kind of brain down to the bottom of these jewels.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 There's nothing else than our mind.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Again, that is true.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Our mind is the decision maker and the projectile, everything.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 So as the Buddha said, the Dho Chititi, now we go to the mind.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Mind is, because mind is everything. It's doing everything.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And so what is mind is? What is mind is?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And mind is now, it's empty. Mind is empty.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Where is the mind is empty? And we ask that question and then somebody will sit.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 If mind is not empty, where is the mind?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 And somebody says to us, where is your mind if not empty?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 What will be our answer? What are we going to sit?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 There's nothing else. There's nothing we can answer.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And mind is not just empty, empty, blank empty.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 It is all that what we're talking about.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 You're listening, I'm talking.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 It's also performed and reflected, activated by mind.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 All mind is disciplined. Yet, where is the mind?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Mind. There's no place of the mind that exists at all.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Anyway, we say in the brain many times, where is the brain?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Which part of the brain mind is?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 How tall mind is? How wide is the mind is?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 How deep is the mind? If we start asking all those questions,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 there's nothing we can give answers, no answers at all.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And then in Buddhism, also in the teaching said, mind is in the heart.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Where is the heart? Which part of that?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 If we start trying to pinpoint and locate the mind, nothing we can't.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 There's no, no can locate the mind.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 This is all teaching, what I'm saying is, teaching of the Buddha or this great master.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But you also investigate yourself. It's true enough.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Buddha teaching is not just a Buddha said, we follow, we listen, and I say, that's not.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Buddha says himself, exam my world, exam my teaching.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 If it's true, you're excited. If not, you can say no.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 When Buddha gives the teachings, generally in those whole kind of Buddha,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 there are so many dialogues. Buddha says sometimes to a student, students say, no, teacher is not.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And the Buddha says, that's true, that's true.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It's not just Buddha said, and that's the final decision.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Buddha like to activate it, energize it, our understanding, our realizations, bring out exactly.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And that's, so in this case, although we, as we said, mind is empty,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.860
 we use all those terminology, what the Buddha great masters told, we should exam, we should analyze

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.000
, we see.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 When you didn't find anything, we clearly have any answer, then that must be true.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Buddha says, mind is empty. All the great masters said, empty, it is emptiness, appearance.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Emptiness, yeah, is appearance. What is the appearance? All the conservatives' appearance.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 All the conservatives from the eye, ear, nose, tongue, tongue, body and mind are all appearance.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Where they are, where they are, again, no base, nothing is transcendent.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 This is what is really known as realization of the mind.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Because this is our meditation, we are going to meditate this, and Zoxi.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 We are going to meditate on this. Therefore, we need confidence.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:49.820
 We must have confidence. With all the confidence, confirmation, then our meditation will be shaking

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.000
.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.460
 Therefore, firm, confident meditation. Then you don't have, once you have established it, then you

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.000
 don't have to lingering.
