00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.060
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.960
 Thank you again, everyone.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 Good afternoon.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.960
 Good morning, maybe.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 Still good morning.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 Thank you.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 Good morning.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 Thank you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 Thank you.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.880
 So now, we talk a little bit about the shila

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.680
 of six paramatas with this.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 So I think I won't read this all because of my actions.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.400
 I don't know if you will understand what I'm reading,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.880
 even though maybe you're looking in the book.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.640
 But I will talk about the six paramatas,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.720
 and then talk about the shila.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.300
 And then you ask me questions, and then I

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.400
 try to answer whatever I can.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.680
 So that's how we follow that.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.240
 And now, generally speaking about the shila.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.720
 Shila is a Sanskrit word and in English,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.680
 many times translated as moralities.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 And also, it can be a synonym as morality, or conduct,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.040
 or ethics.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.800
 So all I believe is very synonyms.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.400
 And generally, in the Buddha's teaching,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.640
 our view of the Buddha's teaching,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.440
 when you take the bodhicata, when you bodhicata,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.840
 and bodhicata is love and compassion,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.720
 and wisdom that combined together is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.960
 known as bodhicata in Sanskrit, that Sanskrit word.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.120
 And it's translated into English as mind of enlightenment,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.640
 mind of enlightenment.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.960
 So what is mind of enlightenment?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.440
 It's mind of enlightenment, compassion, loving kindness,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 wisdom, and thinking of all living beings

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.000
 how to benefit, help to the beings, everyone.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.040
 That thought, at the same time, order to benefit to all beings,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 but I like to become also more enlightened because in order

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.560
 to make the professional way to help to the others,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 you have to be very equipped to yourself.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.600
 You have to be strong in order to be strong.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.080
 That means you're not kind of obscured and disturbed

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720
 by the emotions.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.520
 And for that reason, I like to become the enlightenment

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.760
 or become the Buddha so that I can help all the living beings.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080
 So for that reason, what the Buddha's teaching says,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.320
 bodhicata means has two aspects.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.600
 By comparison, a loving kindness, thought,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.000
 kind of looking, projecting that to all the living beings

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.280
 without any discrimination.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.800
 By wisdom, you're projecting to how

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.600
 can make more powerful, more effectively,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.200
 and that has become Buddha.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.960
 Then I can effectively benefit it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.480
 So by the wisdom, looking to the enlightenment

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.720
 and by the comparison of love, looking

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.040
 to all the living beings.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.040
 So then, because of combination of that truth, all the love

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.120
 and the compassion and wisdom, then you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.440
 develop the bodhicata.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.240
 So you develop the bodhicata.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 And bodhicata is now what actually we all have.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.200
 We all have.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.440
 We all have love.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 We all have compassion.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.000
 We all have wisdom.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.120
 It's not something we don't have.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.040
 But this developing means we're opening that love

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.720
 and compassion and wisdom to all the living beings.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.040
 Now, a prison time, our love and compassion is kind of limited.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.240
 We have kind of restricted in a way.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.920
 Way is not completely open.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.640
 But this time, when you take the bodhicata,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.360
 really you open your heart and opening the wisdom,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.040
 compassion, love to all living beings

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.800
 without any discrimination.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.760
 That attitude, that openness, feeling,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.280
 openness, thought is known as bodhicata, bodhicata.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.400
 So once you develop or when you really

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.360
 activate that quality in the heart and mind,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.120
 how are we going to activate that?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.240
 How now are we going to carry that on?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 That is just a thought.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.600
 Now, this thought, we're going to activate that

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.000
 through the four boundless.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560
 You all know.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.960
 Boundless compassion, boundless of loving kindness,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.200
 boundless of joy, and boundless of equanimity or rejoice.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 This four boundless.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.400
 Four boundless, that means all the living beings.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.360
 You are boundless love to all living beings.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.520
 Boundless compassion to all the living beings.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.480
 Boundless joy and rejoice to all living beings.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.960
 And you also have to balance it.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.760
 Balance it.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.120
 And as well as without discrimination.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.240
 That is called boundless of equanimity.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.920
 That upholds love and compassion in what the bodhicata call it.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.400
 You hold that.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.120
 Now you activate that strongly in the heart and mind.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120
 Mind.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.080
 Now, when that comes to the action,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.120
 how to activate that benefit to the others,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.800
 then in the Buddha's teaching, said six paramatas.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.600
 Six paramatas.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.360
 Six paramatas are the first six paramatas.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.000
 Again, paramata is Sanskrit word.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.440
 Word, and I think you all know, basically.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.840
 So, but, but paramata means that will lead beyond.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.560
 Paramata is Sanskrit means, will lead beyond.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560
 What that means?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.840
 Beyond the duality.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.680
 Beyond, beyond the regimented attitude of the self-important.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.920
 It go beyond, completely.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.080
 And then also, it means beyond, beyond samsara.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.160
 This well, those are, what, therefore, these six paramatas,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.320
 the six of these, will lead us beyond the dualities.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.680
 Beyond the samsara.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.280
 It will take over.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.600
 Because now you have the comparison of love,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.480
 or the poor boundless in the heart and mind so strongly.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.680
 And now, you're activating that with this, through these six

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.240
 different techniques of paramatas.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.480
 And those six paramatas, you all start, you know,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.000
 the generalities, morality, or shila.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.360
 We translate it in Sanskrit.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.840
 Sanskrit, the shila, and then patience, and joyful effort,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.280
 and concentrations, and the vestiges.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.720
 Those Sanskrit words are basically not necessarily,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.400
 I think, important, but if you like to heard this,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.120
 I'm sure it's here, too.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.120
 Too, and the generalities is in Sanskrit

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.360
 called the dhana, dhana paramatas.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.120
 And morality is known as Sanskrit shila paramatas.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.120
 The patient paramata is known as in Sanskrit chanting

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.680
 paramatas.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.840
 And then joyful effort paramata is known

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.480
 as in Sanskrit Bria paramatas.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.880
 And then in the concentration paramata

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.360
 is known as in Sanskrit dhyana paramatas.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.600
 And then in the wisdom paramata is known as in Sanskrit,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.160
 then panda paramatas.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.200
 So those are six paramatas.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.040
 And now these six paramatas are, are, I guess, an overview.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.800
 Of course, you all know, started this.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.600
 You all know this.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.520
 But overviewing these six paramatas, now, these--

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.160
 what are those?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.840
 First, generosity is like giving to the others.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.080
 And morality, then.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.760
 And shila is the moralities.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.040
 When you give things to the others,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.360
 generosity is generally great.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.360
 But when you give things, you have

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.520
 to stand also with ethics.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.800
 Ethics, you have to have moralities, moralities.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.880
 And so when you have the good--

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.440
 you have the open mind, open heart, and generosity,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880
 you have good ethics.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.600
 But then also you need patience.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.080
 Patience is what?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.840
 Courage and commitment, confidence, not lingering

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.920
 and not disturbed by the external, any force.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.840
 When you do have good generosity, when

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.800
 you have the good moralities, samsara of the world,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.200
 there's a lot of troubles.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.960
 Even you're doing really so good,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.920
 still maybe it's not going to accept as it's good.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.720
 Your open heart, your open mind, not

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.000
 going to maybe accept a rumor as that's so pure.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.400
 For that reason, we need also patience, courage,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.840
 and commitment.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.400
 Patience means what?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.920
 In another world, in Sanskrit, the great master,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.280
 Shanti Deva said, in the famous teaching,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.080
 what is the nature of the patient, not disturbed?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
 Not disturbed.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.800
 That is the nature of that.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.280
 So no matter whatever it is, you're not disturbed.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.560
 That is patience, the essence of patience.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.520
 And then to keep up this, we need joyful effort.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.080
 Effort, but joy, joy of generosity, joy of morality,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.120
 and joy of the patience.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.960
 It's not something that we're drugging and overloaded

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.640
 and we're doing this pathetically, we're doing this.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.960
 We're doing this with full of vision, goal,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.880
 something important, not just a sub-centered mind,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.760
 kind of thinking, really thinking to all living beings.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.960
 How wonderful, how beautiful, how special.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.880
 For that reason, great master Shanti Deva said,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.600
 also in his teaching, said, all these so many things,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:52.200
 so many people are doing just so many things in the world.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.560
 In summertime, with summer heat, in the wintertime,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.720
 with winter cold, they are nightly walking.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.200
 They can bear that cold just for their own purposes.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.920
 I'm doing this for all living beings.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.080
 Really, my project is to help all living beings.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.960
 Why I cannot bear?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.880
 Why I should not have the joy?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.720
 You're not just for yourself.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.280
 You're for all the living beings.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.800
 This is a big vision, big goal, big result, big benefit to you

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800
 and to the everyone.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.600
 Oh, this is like win-win situations.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.960
 Truly, for that reason, why I should not have the joy?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.040
 Why I should not have the aspirations?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.840
 Your heart is good, your mind is good, your action is good,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.280
 your object is good, and we will be good.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.520
 For that reason, joyful effort.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.080
 Joyful effort is what the great Master Shanti Deva said.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.000
 Said, when you have the joy, and we have the joy,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.120
 whatever activity is, then it comes so easy,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.840
 and we don't have the joy.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.400
 What his opponent is known as laziness.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.040
 Laziness will take over because lack of joy,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:18.640
 lack of appreciation.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.120
 And right now, you have the beautiful generosity,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:30.600
 morality, and patience, joyful effort.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.400
 Now, what are all those?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.560
 Those are one way, all kind of more outreaching qualities,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.240
 in a way, or particularly the first three.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.560
 Generacy, morality, patience is more outreaching, more outer.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.080
 Now that this fifth paramata is directly dealing with the mind.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.880
 Mind is the most powerful, important.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.080
 Even though it's unseen, we can't see,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.720
 nobody can really see this mind.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.040
 But this unseen, this mind is controlling

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.680
 about every situation, every circumstances, everything.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.800
 So therefore, the Yarn, Dayan paramata,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.760
 is directly dealing with our own, this invisible mind.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.320
 Mind, and mind is restless.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.880
 Mind is running all the time.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.440
 You know, we know, we started this.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.120
 And even when we're sitting down on the cushion,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.600
 where we're kind of physically very calm and peaceful,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.200
 maybe our mind is running.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.920
 Money, that's how the mind is.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.480
 Always, Dayan means calm and peaceful,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.160
 abiding in its own natural state.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.760
 The mind, mind resides, abiding in its own sport.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.760
 That explains Dayan.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.000
 And then, the wisdom.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.960
 Wisdom means understanding, knowing exactly where things are.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.560
 Also, great master was called Shanti Deva said,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.960
 what is Dayan?

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.680
 Dayan means not just distracted.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.360
 That is really the meaning of Dayan, or the concentration,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.320
 not distracted.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.240
 And then, the wisdom.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.360
 The wisdom is knowing exactly as it is.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.200
 Nothing overstated, understood where things are.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.520
 Where things are on the mundane level,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.280
 may where things are beyond the mundane or behind the scene.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.000
 Exactly as it is.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.920
 Not kind of cover up, not making stories, this and that things.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.880
 Or not imagination, this and that.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.760
 But exactly as it is.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.240
 Those are the Buddhism was called.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.080
 The relative truth and absolute truth.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.200
 Seeing things exactly as an absolute truth,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.320
 seeing things exactly as an absolute truth.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.720
 So that is the kind of generally overview

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.200
 of the six parabhas.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.760
 Now six parabhas, entirely generally Buddha teaching,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.040
 can be summarized into three practices.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.200
 Or again, to summarize this.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.880
 Those are known as what?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.280
 You all know, three trainings.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:18.040
 Morality, and concentration, and wisdoms.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.040
 Those are the three trainings.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.720
 Entire the Buddha practices.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.720
 Teachers can be summarized into these three.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.680
 So now, if we summarize this all six parabhas,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.360
 into three, how we do this?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.760
 Force three.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.160
 Generously, morality, patience, all

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.400
 can be summarized into moralities.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.280
 Moralities and peace is concentration,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.360
 and that is the concentration, and then wisdoms,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.080
 and that is wisdoms, so three.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.720
 Morality, concentration, and wisdoms.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.440
 And what about that joyful effort?

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.080
 Joyful effort is support to all of them.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.920
 Joyful need, we need joyful effort for the morality.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.560
 We need joyful effort for the concentration.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.440
 We need joyful effort for the wisdoms.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.800
 So that is just the kind of overview

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.480
 of the six parabhas.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.960
 Six parabhas.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.360
 And now, if you have some questions, I will discuss,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.160
 or maybe you're talking about the shilas now.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.600
 About the shila.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.240
 Shila is now about the six parabhas.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.320
 Second is shila parabhas.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.520
 Shila means, as it was already said, is a conduct,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.600
 is a morality, is ethics.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.720
 But morality and conduct or ethics,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.440
 whatever we use the terminology, this is so important.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.160
 And again, all six parabhas are so important.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.480
 But morality is really so important.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.400
 But you heard, for example, meditation.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.000
 Meditation, when we meditate, we need moralities.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.800
 Morality, without the moralities, we won't go far.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.080
 For that reason, Grand Master Nagarjuna said,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.320
 in his letter to a friend, he said,

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.480
 morality is like ground, ground, like earth.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.880
 Morality is like earth, because earth

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.920
 is the best of everything, everyone, whether we move

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.280
 or whether we don't move, or movable, immovable.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.840
 Everyone is relying on the earth.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.720
 Similarly, morality is the best of everything.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.800
 All the good realization, good achievement, good fulfillment

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:55.280
 based upon the moralities, even you have the good wisdom,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.640
 good concentrations, we don't have the good morality.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.920
 It's falling apart.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.480
 It will fall apart.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.600
 It will go away.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.360
 It will really lose the ground.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.040
 Therefore, morality is so important.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.840
 I mean, this is so important.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.040
 For that reason, what?

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.600
 In Sanskrit, known as Shila.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:23.120
 Shila can be translated as cool.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.440
 When you have the Shila, and also in English, too, I think,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.480
 when you have morality, you are a cool guy.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.200
 Yeah, really, you're a cool guy.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.080
 That person is a gentleman.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.800
 That person is a gentle lady.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.440
 If you don't have the morality, no matter

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.920
 how much you're educated, how much you're rich,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.680
 how much you're powerful, you are not gentle.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.240
 You're not cool.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.200
 Cool.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.240
 Cool.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.800
 Because for Shila, Sanskrit word translated into--

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.560
 I mean, it has meaning, coolness.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.640
 Really, it is cool.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.800
 For that reason, everybody are teaching, explaining.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.480
 Of course, you have to have the wisdom.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.760
 You have to have the understanding.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.200
 You have to do the meditation.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.520
 But if you don't have the moralities, we lost it.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.680
 For that reason, Buddha gave the teaching.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.080
 For example, in the Vinaya teaching,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.920
 there's moralities of the teaching

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.120
 for the lay practitioners.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.800
 How they should be behaved.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.480
 This is not just making Buddhism bound by Buddhism.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.720
 Kind of restricting.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.040
 But how to maintain their identity, quality,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.920
 their upkeeping, the goodness.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.800
 That was good for them, or for us, for everyone.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.720
 That is really guidelines.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.880
 Simple upkeeping instructions.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.880
 How to maintain beautifully.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.960
 Not just maintaining, but how we continue beautifully

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.180
 to succeed.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.560
 Profilment.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.200
 And all the way to the Buddhahood.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.360
 Enlightenment.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.640
 That is the moralities.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.440
 Moralities.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.640
 So morality is so important.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.920
 Morality is then, as I see here too, explaining.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.320
 Morality, that in samsara morality.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.240
 Which means traditions, rules, regulations, systems

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.440
 of the contradiction.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.000
 Respect and appreciate.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.720
 Follow that wherever the contradiction stays.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.600
 We should respect and appreciate.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.200
 Follow the rules.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.040
 All the rules, most of the rules,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.800
 are really kind of designed to help, but good for us.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.680
 Something that good for you, good for others, to everyone.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.640
 Therefore, rules are very important.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.040
 That's called the moralities.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.760
 If we keep them perfectly, we are then completely beautiful.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.920
 Beautiful, what's called?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.440
 Beautiful nephew and niece of Uncle Sam's.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.960
 Beautiful nephew, you're really cool.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.880
 Then Uncle Sam will be very happy.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.920
 Oh, they are really good.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.120
 If we don't do that, and Uncle Sam will look at what's called?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.080
 On the sideways.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.760
 Side eye.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.760
 So therefore, rules and regulations are really good.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.400
 In Buddhatic, it's very important.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.920
 Respect and appreciate.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.000
 Any samsara guidelines, rules, regulations,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 that something is benefiting to the other beings

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.800
 and not hurting.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.960
 Not hurting to anyone.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.800
 Anyone is good.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.840
 It's good with that.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.080
 In the dharmas, the rules and regulations.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.520
 And then there is so many samayas, so many wows,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.600
 so many instructions.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.520
 They really have to keep up that.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.280
 Oh, this is something that God ourself.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.160
 God, G-U-A-R-D. I think God ourself.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.760
 God our physical activities.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.200
 God our verbal activities.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.520
 God our mental activities.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.480
 Mental activities from negativities,

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.160
 from disturbance to me, to one's own self, to the others.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.960
 Then God I give all those guidelines.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.040
 How to really sustain so beautiful, calm, and peaceful.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.720
 If we keep this morality, then it's really good for us

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.920
 and good for others.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.840
 It will become more gentle, more peaceful, more pleasing.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.760
 Life will become more rich, more simple, more calm.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.920
 And then also just with that feeling, that calling,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.800
 it's really become so rich, rich and helpful

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.800
 to the other beings, according to your capabilities,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.880
 or according to readiness for others.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.880
 And then that is known as basically morality.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.840
 And then morality can be divided.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.560
 I'm sure it's mentioned there too.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.640
 If we go more kind of detail, detailed morality

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.800
 in the Buddha teaching, those are known as morality.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.480
 That will stop all the negativities.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.200
 And morality, that will gather all the virtues.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.840
 And morality, that will benefit for all living beings.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.680
 So those are three moralities.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.080
 Morality, stopping all the negative activities.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.000
 And by directly, indirectly, that is one.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.360
 And morality, that gathering all the virtues,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.480
 all the good things, learn good things,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.240
 improve yourself, good things.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.000
 And skills, methods that some days benefit to you,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.080
 to the others, in the context of the peace and harmony,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.560
 we should learn those things, those.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.000
 And then morality, that benefit to all living beings,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.720
 then help to the others as much as you can.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.520
 With gentle, with peaceful, with respectfully,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.360
 and help to the others, according your capabilities

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.400
 and according readiness of the receivers or receives.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.240
 And you do help to that.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.640
 Those are known as three moralities.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.280
 I'm sure it's mentioned there.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.240
 So that is my brief overview of the moralities

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.200
 and the six power methods.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.920
 And now, if you have some questions,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.400
 I'm really happy to answer as much as I can.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.400
 Thank you, thank you.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.600
 - I have a question. - He is, yes.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.920
 - My question is, of course,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.560
 morality starts from the family, right?

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.280
 - Pardon? - Family.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.080
 Morality, you know, you teach children.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.720
 - Oh yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.520
 - That's very good, that is expected.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.920
 That is the first school of the mind.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.440
 But when you look around the world,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.320
 it has not been the part of the school

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.560
 and college and university.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.840
 Why they're done, it is so important,

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.680
 so why they're not incarcerated.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.160
 Morality in the education.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.560
 Of course you are talking about ethics

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.560
 and morality in the workplace.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.800
 There's small introduction, you know,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.400
 just representation.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.160
 But as I feel and everybody feels that

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.720
 it should be part of the education in the school,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.200
 college and university.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.960
 Why we have not been able to do that?

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.160
 - That's true, I think most of the time,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.680
 I believe it's due to the really different kind of like,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.560
 what's called the habit dependence.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.160
 And also due to the kind of like,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.840
 some people are not so emphasizing on the moralities.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.280
 I mean, some people do that.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.120
 That's the way of their habit.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.800
 And maybe more emphasizing of the kind of

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.480
 starting learning things, which is so important that,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.080
 but morality, sometimes they kind of ignore.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.960
 And many times also practitioners think that,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.160
 oh, meditation is so important.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.880
 And practicing is kind of like,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.960
 practice sitting is so important.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.320
 But many times, even practice,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.160
 Dharma practicing is not so kind of keen

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.280
 or thinking of the moralities.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.520
 But morality is really so important in Buddhism.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.080
 Buddhism, when you don't have the good morality,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.960
 I said many times, then it can fall apart.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.880
 And then just fall apart.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.360
 So therefore morality and the practice goes side by side.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.800
 Side by side.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.920
 If you keep this two together,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.920
 then really its fulfillment really comes so beautifully.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.360
 So therefore, so I would say just in the world,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.400
 they don't, don't.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.920
 And I think it is due to the habitual,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.160
 due to the traditions, due to the also maybe

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.360
 different kind of beliefs and so forth.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.480
 And then just kind of they blow it up.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.000
 And then they focus more kind of like

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.520
 starting or more those things in a school,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.240
 and which is so important.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.920
 But when that happened, and then many times,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.120
 I mean, the morality is really good.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120
 I will say.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.080
 Yes, yes, please.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.320
 Yeah.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.360
 Yeah, okay.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.200
 Yeah.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.480
 - Thank you, Kimball.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.160
 Is it possible for us to have good intentions

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.600
 for lack of morality?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.200
 - Yeah, definitely that happened.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.800
 That can happen.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.040
 I have good intentions.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.160
 We have very beautiful intentions.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.440
 And then maybe the good morality,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.440
 because morality is also based on the nice understanding.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:34.680
 And then you have to also really have to see how,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.760
 for example, your intention is good,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.640
 but how it is going to work.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.520
 You have to be, that is a world code.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.560
 Knowing that as much as we can,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.040
 that knowledge is called the wisdom.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.480
 So morality is guided by the wisdom.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.840
 So even you have the good intention, the good things,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.640
 but if it's going to benefit, it's work for you,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.000
 and work to the others.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.040
 All work is good for many ways,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.800
 and really always observe it.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.560
 And that is really very important.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 Yes, yeah, please.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.880
 - In the way of the Bodhisattva,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.320
 the poem by Sanjay Deva,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.800
 he says that when you're generating bodhicitta,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.240
 or when you're trying to not let it diminish.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.080
 - Wouldn't it?

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.440
 - In that four line things,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.480
 for those without it may be generated.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.320
 - Yeah, yeah, bodhi.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.480
 - Those who have it may not diminish,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.680
 but always be increasing.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.000
 He said all three sort of stages,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.320
 you have to whip up a sense of urgency.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.400
 And many years ago,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.000
 I saw Krishnamurti in Switzerland in 1970.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.440
 He said if you were in a house that was on fire,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.640
 there'd be real urgency to get out.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.480
 How do you recommend whipping up

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.320
 a sense of urgency to practice?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.160
 Instead of doing it,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.880
 I remember the Dalai Lama was saying,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.960
 "We're not supposed to become marshmallows."

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.760
 How would you recommend whipping up a sense of urgency?

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.040
 - Of course, urgency generally, the practice is really

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.240
 practicing that to connect to our heart and mind.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.720
 Heart and mind with the context of love and compassion.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.560
 Bodhicitta, that's what we're talking.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.240
 It is really the most important in our lives.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.160
 Our lives, all the activities are important.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.640
 But to compare with the bodhicitta,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.680
 all the other activities are secondaries.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.720
 Really secondaries.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.600
 Love and compassion, this worship is so important,

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.200
 so precious to you and to all the other beings.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.040
 So therefore, and life is also,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.640
 how long are we going to stay?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.360
 We don't know how long.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.560
 Well, everything is in our situation.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.920
 Well, everything is in our reachable state,

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.360
 as you this time, make this precious time,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.680
 as really is so important.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.840
 It's very urgent.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.120
 In the teaching series, you see, in the great masters,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.120
 you see, do practice and don't wait.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.320
 Check now.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.200
 Now is the most important, use these opportunities.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.960
 Use these opportunities as examples.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.960
 If the snake, snake, snake, if snake comes on the lap

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.640
 of the timid person, timid person,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.360
 what that timid person will do?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.840
 He's not going to wait until this, get up immediately.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.120
 Get up immediately.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.120
 So the as snake enter the timid, lap of the timid person,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.480
 or the beautiful Miss American catch the fire on her,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.200
 what she will do?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.720
 She will immediately act something out of that.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.960
 In the teaching series, as important and urgent as that,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.880
 really said, like that, catching the fire

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.720
 on the beautiful girls' ladies.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.400
 I just said, Miss America, I'm sorry.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.880
 I just not said that, but beautiful ladies,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.880
 the lady catch the fire on their heads,

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.240
 or enter the snake in the timid's lap.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.080
 That's really said.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.920
 It's true.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.240
 I mean, look, life is so precious.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.960
 Life is so important.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.120
 But something that when we leave this world,

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.440
 we really cultivate the bodhicitta,

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.720
 we did like do something with the bodhicitta activities,

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.160
 that something, it makes it happy.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.800
 It makes more confidence, more stronger to our self

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.760
 and to the other beings.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.760
 That's what the great master, Shandarachi Shanti,

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.720
 they were saying too.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.560
 Yes.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.400
 - Professor Shanti, in our study group,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.920
 we've been trying to get a clearer understanding

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.880
 of the meaning of the word transcendental,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.000
 and in this context, like when are paramitas,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.760
 regular paramitas, and when are paramitas transcendental?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.960
 - Okay.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.960
 Actually, this paramata, paramata is Sanskrit word,

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.720
 I think it's translated into English,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.600
 I thought transcendental, itself.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.680
 And whatever paramata,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.240
 every kind of translated roughly,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.240
 exactly as the word paramata,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.600
 then I think it means it will take you other shore.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:51.480
 Paramatas, one which will take to the other shore.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.640
 So this means that this shore where we are is samsara,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.800
 or if I use the word today, duality.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.440
 But if you continue practice of these six paramatas,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.360
 it will tell you the other shore, shore of nirvana,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.360
 or shore of beyond samsara, or dualities.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.760
 So that, and what is that?

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.840
 Actually, how do you do that?

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.400
 That is actually what in the teachings said,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.520
 said when that will become,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.080
 when our janarusta will become the transcendental

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.080
 or the paramata of janarusta or dana paramatas.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.680
 When we don't have the grasping,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.600
 we don't have the grasping on the subject,

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.080
 when we don't have the grasping on the object,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.040
 we don't have the grasping on the action.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.160
 So subject and object action,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.360
 when we don't have the grasping,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.240
 that is known as then your janarusta practice

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.640
 is transcendental or the paramata,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.920
 your morality is paramata.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.400
 Paramata, everything become then paramata.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.000
 Until that, that also indicated,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.800
 even we do the janarusta,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.900
 even though the all is within the frame of dualities,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.940
 which is good, this duality,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.460
 this duality will lead us beyond the duality.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.600
 This is a good remedy in a way,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.720
 as I always think that like homopedic systems,

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.680
 we use the same remedy order to cure that obstacles.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.380
 So we're using this, we don't have any other choice,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:44.380
 we use it skillfully with duality to go beyond the dualities.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.960
 And when duality, beyond the duality,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.960
 then it is transcendental or paramata.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.040
 - Thank you. - Yes, please.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.880
 - Thank you, Ramesh.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.680
 I don't know if very often in our culture,

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.160
 we would think about doubt as being immoral,

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.880
 and yet as among the negative emotions mentioned here

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.240
 as part of an immorality.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.920
 Could you talk a little bit about--

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920
 - No, generally doubt is not necessarily always negatives.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.000
 Doubt has two aspects.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Doubt is, one aspect is aspect of the wisdom, intelligence.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.960
 And for that reason, for example,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.480
 example in the Buddha's teaching, what is it called?

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.640
 Studying and contemplations.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.920
 When you are contemplating, you can help doubt.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.400
 That means you're asking questions.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.000
 You're putting inquiry to yourself or to the others

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.140
 to make sure it is true.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:55.280
 And to make that true, that is aspect is doubt

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.480
 or that the inquiry thought is good,

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.680
 is nothing really wrong yet.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.400
 But once you establish it,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.000
 once you establish the concrete certainty of wisdom,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.640
 then doubt is obstacles.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.760
 Then it pulls back to you.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.160
 Then it brings the unsuccessful.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.200
 You won't achieve that.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.680
 But during the, for example,

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.240
 investigation and analyzation, you can have doubt.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.320
 Doubt is not really nothing bad.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.720
 And then, for example, during our meditation,

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.600
 during the practices,

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.360
 if we have started doubt, that will become obstacles.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.640
 Because you already established,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.040
 you already know the practices,

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.400
 you already know this,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.200
 if we start putting inquiries,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.840
 then it's just a delay.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.280
 It's another conception.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.360
 It's obstacles.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.080
 Okay.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.820
 Here it is.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.480
 - I'm going to change.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.720
 Spot will bear me out in this.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.200
 I find so much immorality in the world now

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.160
 compared to when I was a child growing up,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.400
 that I can't watch the news or see what's going on

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.760
 because I am so sad and I am so angry

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.800
 and I feel so helpless

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.400
 with the lack of morality in the world right now.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.040
 And I know that doubt and anger

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.360
 and all of this is clinging.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.520
 But I'm a small person with a little life

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.200
 and there's nothing I can do in that world,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.280
 I can only practice.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.440
 So how can I overcome this judgment

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.480
 about lack of morality?

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.360
 And also use my practice to be of benefit.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.200
 - No, this is true.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.680
 This looks like, I mean, I don't know.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.880
 Of course, generally in Surya, in the samsara,

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.600
 a code of Buddha teaching, I'm sure is true.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.360
 Same thing in the samsara days, in all these world,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.160
 it's always had a lot of emotions,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.440
 a lot of troubles, a lot of just moralities.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.520
 Really, this is not just the new.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.480
 I think it's always like being like,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.880
 I believe that maybe sometimes a little bit more

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.080
 on the surface, sometimes not too much on the surface,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.840
 but it's basically, it's just always like this.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.800
 Now it looks like these times are more on the surface.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.360
 Can't worry, it's so many,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.240
 violence is going all over the world,

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.600
 or many places, and then violence,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.200
 and then also natural disasters are also really erupting.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.520
 And then also, all these difficult troubles,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.440
 so many things happening one after another, that is true.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.680
 This now looks really, can't worry.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.520
 So many things.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.400
 But I think when this happened,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.560
 I think is what we do every can,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.960
 can really generate more both each others,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.880
 more both each other, more compare.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.240
 All this happening according to the Buddha's teaching

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.840
 is due to the ignorance.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.920
 So, ignorance is really to blame.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.760
 The ignorance is manipulating to everything,

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.280
 and then during all this happening,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.000
 there's reflecting, there's ignorance in the form,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.880
 then of course, in anger, or yellows,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.040
 hairdos, or combination, and all the greedy,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.800
 and then all these troubles happening.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.560
 So therefore, it's really like according to Buddha's teaching,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.960
 really as much as we can generate both each other,

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.760
 and do our prayers, then may that not happen.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.440
 As much as this, as our poor, boneless prayers.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.760
 May all living beings free from the suffering,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.160
 the cause of suffering,

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.200
 may they be,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.480
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.480
 I mean, they will never be disassociated

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.720
 from the supreme happiness which is without suffering.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.320
 I mean, those poor, boneless prayers,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.680
 they do as much as we can.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.720
 And our wishing, positive wishing,

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.760
 positive wishing power is what we can contribute it,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.760
 to calm down this.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.400
 And we do this,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.880
 even maybe you don't see it immediately,

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.800
 immediately that, but you're making peace.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.000
 They say, peace start with you.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.560
 Really started from your own home.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.560
 Home, and then spread that.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.520
 You truly, I mean, whoever do this,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.040
 we become peacemakers.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.400
 Really peacemaker, we're making peacemaker

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.320
 very kind of grassroots and practical way.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.040
 We can make the peace to everyone immediately as well.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.080
 But we started.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.120
 That's what our greatest teacher Buddha said,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.160
 "Do yourself."

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.000
 That's it, really.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.560
 So I think that's the really,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.440
 ending the prayer.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.680
 And then of course we can get emotions.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.480
 I've said overseeing situation,

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.760
 all the different news things,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.040
 but just really like, also for the joking meditation,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.280
 kind of letting it go.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.080
 I mean, we can't do anything.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.560
 Except to do the prayer,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.400
 and kind of make ourselves kind of a little more stronger,

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.120
 calmer, and peaceful.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.880
 If we do that, then really we are doing some good difference.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.400
 Okay.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.240
 - Thank you very much.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.080
 - Thank you.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.920
 - It's important.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.760
 - Thank you.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.920
 (audience laughing)

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.760
 Yes.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.640
 - Okay.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.080
 I have read about and known many teachers

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.400
 who have fallen from grace.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.840
 Usually misconduct, sexual misconduct.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.720
 And these are people who I think

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.280
 were enlightened masters and beings.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.680
 Do we forgive them?

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.920
 And how do we look to somebody

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.440
 who is a great teacher and who falls

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.720
 because of lack of morality?

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.720
 - I think that is definitely as you said that,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.400
 that is true, exactly true.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.960
 But I mean, that happened.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.800
 I think the teachers also really,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.640
 I don't know, I mean,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.880
 I think there's according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.840
 Again, I'm talking with the court of Buddhism,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.760
 that all the sentient beings has imperfect.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.800
 And all the teachers, they may be great teachers,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.440
 but they are not Buddha's enlightened beings.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.880
 And therefore, anybody can do mistakes.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.120
 And for that reason,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.320
 I think it's really forgive and excuse

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.440
 and learn from that lesson.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.480
 Lesson and see how this happened.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.600
 Happening and may other teachers

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.040
 and might include our one's own self

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.040
 may not fall down in these kind of situations.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.040
 May I have always good morality,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.360
 good conduct and good both each other.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.960
 So wish and pray,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.880
 and but excuse and forgive.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.520
 And that is known as what?

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.760
 Again, we generally practice here,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.800
 six power matas among the six power matas.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.560
 And that is also really when you forgive.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.480
 It is a generosity.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.400
 It is generosity.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.120
 You give forgiveness and it's part of generosity.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.920
 Also, it's part of the ignorance that happened.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.000
 Feel compassion, improve,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.120
 learn from that and then move forward,

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.920
 not become that, become obstacle

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.840
 to progress growth of our own developments.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.520
 Thank you.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.880
 Yes.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.640
 - I have a question.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.640
 With, is there something kind of like a national karma?

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.160
 I mean, we have our individual karma,

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.920
 but sometimes it feels like we're swept up in a tide,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.440
 you know, like if our say our country goes to war

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.640
 or something, we may not believe in that.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.160
 I think it's terrible, but somehow we're part of it.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.360
 Is there, you know, is there a kind of way

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.200
 to deal with that or is that the real,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.120
 is that just an imagination

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.240
 or is karma, is it always individual?

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.000
 - No, this is, of course, karma is a very complex city.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.920
 Complex city, according to the Buddha teaching,

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.040
 which is true, I mean, it's really a complex city,

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.320
 but however, according to the Buddha teaching,

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.400
 this is definitely something of karma.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.000
 This is called the individual karma

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.120
 and a group, group karmas, group karmas.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.520
 And this is something that we're,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.680
 what we're going through in the world

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.960
 or whatever the suffering we're going to generate.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.520
 This is called group karmas.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.120
 And how that happened?

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.880
 According to Buddha's teaching,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.320
 because karma or our birth is not this first time

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.200
 or no, it will be last.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.440
 And therefore, each time, many times,

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.480
 we do guru-blee, also, kind of activity, action together,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.440
 and that really known as the group karmas.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.560
 And then consequently as a result,

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.480
 that will come then, sometimes later,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.400
 that lifetime or afterward.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.720
 And so what we're experiencing,

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.280
 many times, this can be also a group karma too.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.200
 Thank you.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:08.440
 - It's also a question kind of along the lines

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.600
 of what Mimi was asking about, about doubt.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.600
 I also sometimes understood the answer as being,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.760
 when you're developing an understanding,

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.200
 then it's okay to question,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.520
 so you can develop that understanding.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.360
 But then once you have an understanding

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.240
 and you get involved in practice,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.040
 then you should have confidence, right?

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.040
 - That's true.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.600
 - I have a problem though.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.240
 Sometimes doubts continue coming up throughout my practice.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.480
 I don't doubt the core teachings of the Buddha,

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.960
 but sometimes specific explanations,

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.960
 maybe the philosophical or something that I read in the text.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.000
 Part of it could be that when I hear explanations,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.040
 maybe the explanation that works for one person

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.160
 is not the same as the explanation that would work for me,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.960
 but it creates instability in my practice.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.920
 How do you work with that?

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.920
 - No, this is, generally this questions or the doubt

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.880
 about your philosophical systems

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.480
 or the questions about the philosophical systems.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.080
 I think that's really okay.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.600
 It's not really obstacle.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.600
 But during your practices,

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.240
 during for half an hour your meditation or practices

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.640
 or 15 minutes of meditation practices

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.080
 or whatever you have the time,

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.720
 don't use that time as questioning

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.280
 of the philosophical systems.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.160
 You have the 24 hours in the day

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.440
 and this time you're spending half an hour.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.360
 That is not the questioning time.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.040
 That is the practicing time.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.640
 So trying to be wise of our time.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.120
 After that, then you can have questions.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.480
 It's okay.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.360
 You can vote that reason.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.400
 Great teacher Buddha said,

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.840
 "You don't have to accept my word as you say."

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.280
 You exam, you exam as goldsmith,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.280
 exam the gold, burn, cut, rub.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.920
 Rub and see the authenticity of the cut.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.120
 So you can exam.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.000
 But once you during the practices

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.880
 should not have any questions,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.520
 then it's scared in mind.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:36.080
 Scared in mind, the conception is like monkey mind.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.760
 It distributes to our meditation.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.000
 So really don't.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.760
 Trying to, even question thought comes or doubt comes,

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.600
 I'm not going to.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.720
 Now I'm going to practice.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.320
 Just really do the practice.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.760
 That means practice means you settled.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.480
 You settled.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.960
 But the contemplation, studying,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.960
 contemplation and meditation.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.440
 Practice means meditation.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.000
 Or meditation means practice.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.680
 Then you settled.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.320
 Now you're going to develop that.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.640
 That really I will say that, that's it.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.400
 But then one, for example, also in the practices,

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.520
 you've been practicing a long time.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.280
 Long practice, suddenly something kind of doubt comes.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.600
 Suddenly that.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.280
 That is then, is called,

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.800
 in the most determined by the teaching is obstacles.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.040
 Then comes it, kind of oh why this and that.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.920
 Kind of like, almost like kind of untold

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.240
 for thing kind of doubt and hesitations.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.680
 Or something come up and then,

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.320
 kind of like practice become shaky.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.000
 And that is obstacles.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.160
 And I mean that happened, let it go.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.560
 Don't analyze of any of those things

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.440
 and restrain your body together.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.640
 Feel more close, connect to the Gharapam or Sambo

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.000
 or the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.800
 Really feel the blessings and reach that,

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.640
 restrain your confidence and practices.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.640
 And that happened many times.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.080
 Also in the Buddha teaching said,

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.280
 and many times those people who practice

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.200
 ancient time in the caves, in the mountains,

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.600
 they practiced for many years.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.480
 And so going beautiful, all the practices,

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.800
 so beautiful, nice and wonderful.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.880
 And suddenly something came up in the thought

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.880
 or in the dream or the vision,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.040
 vision or this and that thing.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.480
 Then kind of like completely that

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.400
 stent is demolishing that.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.280
 And that is obstacles, hindrance.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.120
 Hindrance.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.000
 That obstacle, hindrance is also

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.360
 according to Buddha teaching is nothing bad.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.960
 Actually it means you're improving,

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.120
 you're growing, you're dribbling.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.040
 And in a way that obstacle, that whatever comes,

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.560
 it is like, what's called here, growing pains.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.760
 You're growing pains.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.000
 So you're growing that.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.480
 But if you carry by that force,

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.400
 then it really become the obstacle, really.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.800
 Then it will knock down us.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.280
 So therefore, restrain the courage,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.400
 restrain the commitment, restrain the devotion,

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.560
 restrain the body, feel closeness to the Buddha

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.240
 and grab some of our lineage masters

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.560
 and just embrace that and mingle with that

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.280
 and then do the good things.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.720
 And then we will fly very high and beautiful and relax

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.160
 and then enjoy the panoramic views.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.160
 (audience laughing)

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.240
 - Okay.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.960
 Yes, please.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.240
 - Ah yeah, all right, Kampala.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.680
 As long as you're on that same of this realm

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.120
 of train of thought, it struck me that sometimes

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.280
 when I need to, when it's my time for practice,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.560
 I set aside certain days and certain times.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.120
 But sometimes I just feel a little distracted

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.840
 and I say, and when I actually push myself,

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.440
 I try to and I sit and practice and I have my session

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.960
 and the kind of things come to my mind

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.240
 and it kind of fights through my doubts

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.800
 and I still come up with new awakenings.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.400
 Should I trust what my mind comes to?

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.240
 - (speaking in foreign language)

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.200
 - I think it's on the same train of thoughts

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.880
 as the doubts as the gentleman said.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:22.280
 Should I trust that even when I feel a little shaky

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.320
 and then when I'm on my mat, my cushion,

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.880
 my mind steadies with whatever I'm coming up with.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.040
 Should I trust that?

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.240
 - No, yeah, you can, because it is practice.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.280
 It means when you're sitting down on the cushion,

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.320
 you're going to practice.

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.080
 And that means actually whatever.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.920
 If you say another word where you say,

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.660
 you're going to cultivate your positive mind.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:49.600
 That session is cultivating, you dedicated that session

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.120
 for one hour, half hour, 15 minutes,

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.340
 is cultivating the positive mind in one way.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.320
 So there any thought comes that something is opposite

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.440
 of a positive, really let that thought goes

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.480
 and generating more positive thought

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.960
 among that maybe more compassion, more joy,

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.640
 more appreciation and just bring that thought.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.640
 I mean, we have many reason to be happy in joy,

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.120
 more graceful, bring those practices.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.600
 It's not just a, in a Buddha teaching,

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.480
 it's not just a one single thing.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.080
 It's a variety of the positive and you have to cultivate it

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.900
 and bring that and reveal our own beauty.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.740
 So really just more compassion, more loving kindness,

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.960
 more joy, more graceful, whatever.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.400
 Just feel that power and feel the presence of the Buddhas.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.400
 Buddha is sitting right in front of us

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.120
 with the golden glowing light.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.920
 Buddha is full of love, compassion, wisdom,

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.800
 radiating that light of love and compare it to you

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.480
 and to all the, how wonderful, how fortunate.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.000
 I'm the one of the beautiful,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.880
 fortunate beings on this planet.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.320
 Really feel that, I mean, truly you are, we are.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.560
 Each of that, just being, that is actually,

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.240
 in a Buddhist, that is practice, that is Dharma.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.260
 It's not something that you're doing on Dharma.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.240
 That is the heart of the practices.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.920
 Then relax, then meditate.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.280
 Calm and physical.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.040
 Not thinking, thoughts carried that relax.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.100
 Okay, thank you.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:33.200
 Okay, thank you, good, thank you everyone again.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.560
 Thank you so much, thank you everyone.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.520
 (audience applauds)

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.520
 Oh, thank you, thank you very much.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.080
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.720
 Then we do one minute again, calm meditation

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.520
 and then dedicate one phrase in this text.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.080
 (audience applauds)

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.500
 (wind blows)

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.500
 (wind blows)

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.500
 (wind blows)

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.500
 (wind blows)

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:30.400
 Okay, and we have this text.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.560
 I'm spooklet page 14 and seven, number seven.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.400
 We join this.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.080
 (audience applauds)

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:54.600
 The precious body jetta, in those without it,

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.020
 may it be generated.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.920
 In those who have it, may it never be demolished.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.680
 But always, the continuation.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:05.900
 (gentle music)

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.660
 (gentle music)

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:40.980
 Thank you everyone, thank you.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.320
 Thank you very much everyone.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.280
