00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.960
 - Among all the Buddhas, the Guru Padmasambha is also known as the Buddha of the Degeneration

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 Times. It's very swift and quick. The Guru Padmasambha is also not just gone in the past

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.280
 time. It's not just million stories, but it's the Buddha of Now. Buddha of Now. And Guru

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.200
 Padmasambha continually, to those practicing the devotee persons, Guru Padmasambha appeared

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.560
 so many ways in the direct preserving state as we went all those different Buddhist stories,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.800
 one after another, and how the Guru Padmasambha appeared. And then in the dream, in the vision,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.040
 and in the narrative, Guru Padmasambha's support and the blessing inspired all those

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 practitioners. Not just only the new practitioners, the new masters of the Buddhasans, but all

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.120
 those great practitioners of the old different schools of the Buddhasans. When we read the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.520
 life story of those, each and all those great masters of practitioners, everyone really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.680
 said, almost everyone said, how they are inspired, how they are blessed, the powers of Guru Padmas

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.800
ambha

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.560
 are received and they are inspired. So the Guru Padmasambha was not just the Buddha of the past,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.880
 but therefore is the Buddha of three times. It's not now. And we have the joy, the devotion in the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.550
 field prisons, the practitioners always experience the blessing of the Guru Padmasambha in some way

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560
,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.840
 directly, indirectly. And that is the swift power of the Guru Padmasambha. He promised,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 he commented with that. He said, as he said, and it was witnessed by all those great practitioners,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.080
 or the masters, one after another. So therefore, this Guru Padmasambha is a very special Buddha of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.800
 these degenerate times. We all have such a special connection to the Guru Padmasambha. It's not

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 just

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.680
 co-accidentally developed, but we all had a beautiful connection to Guru Padmasambha and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.840
 that which is rapping and maturing and we should continually act with that and with this devotion,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.720
 with these prayers that we learned.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 [speaking in foreign language]

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:57.640
 Again, Guru Padmasambha is not just like that enlightenment of Guru Padmasambha and not just

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:12.160
 kind of gradually become the Buddha. Guru Padmasambha is also known as the direct emanation of the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:21.520
 Buddha Amitabha. Buddha Amitabha and reincarnation of the Buddha Shattarman. And this is what Guru

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.760
 Padmasambha himself said, and as well as all the prefections in the teaching. And as we learned,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.000
 so therefore, all this, we just kind of were telling these things, just remembering, remembering,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.560
 reconnecting by what precious Guru Padmasambha is and what special is. And that's what really,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.560
 so it is like direct emanation of Buddha Amitabha who came in this world, wanted to benefit to all

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.400
 things, particularly to glorify the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamunis and the particular teaching

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.760
 of the Vedaya of the Buddha Shakyamunis. That's what that really, Guru Padmasambha is.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.160
 Guru Padmasambha, Guru Padmasambha, is also known as the Vedaya of the Buddha Shakyamunis,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.840
 which is also known as the Vedaya of the Buddha Shakyamunis. Guru Padmasambha is also known as the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.540
 Vedaya of the Buddha Shakyamunis. Guru Padmasambha is also known as the Vedaya of the Buddha Shaky

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.400
amunis.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:06:05.000
 And again, this time, we had a wonderful opportunity to do practice on the Gopi and Masambha,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.120
 Sambha and particularly follow the teaching and the great practice of the Gopi and Masambha,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.520
 known as the Livedama. There are so many prayers to the Gopi and Masambha. There are so many

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.240
 teachings and prayers to the Gopi and Masambha and life stories of the Gopi and Masambha. But

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:30.480
 among all that, this Livedama practice, prayer, is considered like one of the very

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:38.320
 blessed-for prayers. One of many Gopi and Masambha used to call the King of all prayers of the Gopi

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.000
 and Masambha. Livedama is the King of all, among all prayers to the Gopi and Masambha. It is very

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.160
 kind of renowned, powerful practices among all the private devotees of the Gopi and Masambha. It

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.320
 is very, very special. And this is also said, and this is also uttered by the Gopi and Masambha,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.960
 his direct voice, and recorded that, and hidden. And after that, when he revere this teaching or

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.160
 the great master, when he revere or the zapotrap, or when he revere this or raskar, after that,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:23.360
 how many great masters repeat this war again and again? So it is wars of the wisdom of so many

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.680
 great

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:33.280
 masters. Master continually reverberated in the space of Dharmadathu, one up another. Like hundreds

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.720
 of thousands of the great enlightened beings, masters that we named, or you know, everyone

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.630
 joined this. It's kind of like put in, put so many blessings, one up another to that, and receive

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.800
 the

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.760
 power continually blessed to that, one up another. So this is the most, one of the most really

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.120
 powerful

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.920
 practices. We had great opportunity to follow this teaching and this for one month. And then also,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.840
 they're not just only there, and this is kind of like a spontaneous, kind of accomplished,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:13.080
 organized situation. The ending of our retreat is such a beautiful day, and a very significant day

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.120
 in the Gharapama symbols, some of the practices today is standard. It's not something that we

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.360
 organized, thought to blame that, but it's really helping that. This year we practiced on the Tiki

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.480
 Pacific Mall in Gharapama symbol, and dedicated then, and then also the kankaluri at this time,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:38.160
 is on this stage. So it just, I mean, all this, there's many stories and talk about, it is, it is

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.360
 in that way, one way maybe we think, think is a little more superstitious thinking, but other way

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:52.440
 it is true, true. And that's what it is, the superstitious is a true superstitious. So we feel

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:59.720
 kind of so happy and excited, and feel it is some degree that is in the blessings of our all

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.520
 devotion

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.960
 to Gharapama symbol, we kankaluri that this is. And therefore, we're going to dedicate this

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.160
 merit to all, so many beings having difficulty, couples, you know, everywhere, every country. And

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.880
 then as well as all, we're going to dedicate it to all those great beings, the great leaders of the

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.320
 world, who will bring the peace and happiness to the world, to every level, and a great

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.360
 enlightenment,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.560
 a great mastery teacher. So really, any individual family member, we dedicated this merit to

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.280
 everyone

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.360
 to bring the joy and peace and happiness to fulfill. And then finally, our beautiful goal,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.360
 enlightenment, will become as in Gharapama symbol. So we dedicate that, those that have

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.920
 kind of thought, with those beautiful and modulation, thought, and then going to give

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:54.600
 the last missions of these seven chapters of practice. So please, present Gharapama symbol

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.380
 and entitled "The Mandala" and all those Latinas as we follow.
