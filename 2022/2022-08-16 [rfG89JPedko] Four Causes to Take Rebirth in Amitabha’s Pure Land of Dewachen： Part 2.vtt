00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, as I already said to you, and welcome everyone.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 Trachi deliks, and the Trachi deliks, welcome. Today we're going to discuss or remind of the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.960
 teaching of our

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.200
 gracious kindness, compassionate teacher, the Buddha taught about 2,600 years ago.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.560
 He gave variety of teachings to benefit all living beings through his love, compassion, nonviolence

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.560
,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.000
 peaceful approach, and respect and appreciation to every single living being in that context,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.080
 contracts of love, compassion, respect, appreciation, and harmonious. And he gave variety of

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.640
 teachings.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 All those teachings solve the problems of our living being that we always

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.680
 challenge or encounter all the time, such as physical trouble, mental trouble, emotional

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.600
 trouble, psychological trouble, or generally, basically, all kinds of troubles.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 He gives so many teachings how to really bring more calm, peace back to our nature, back to our

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 source, where really we actually belong. He gives so many teachings. So this teaching, what again,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.720
 I'm going to just reactivate it, remind it to all of us of this song of the teachings. Again, to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.400
 begin this teaching or to reflect the teaching, always in the teaching said, correct the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.200
 motivations.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 Because motivation is really the instrumental wherever we like to direct our life, our destination

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.250
 of the now and the future. Future, right now we are on a now, on a now, on the platform of the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.720
 present.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.160
 And the future is our destination. Whether you are believing or not believing,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:22.640
 future is our destination. To make the better future, we have to reactivate our direction

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.240
 right now. Now we'll lead the direction of the future wherever we like to turn.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.640
 As I said, whether we believe or non-believe us, or we are an intellectual thinker analyzing

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.000
 whatever it is, future is our destination. So from where, how we turn to change. Therefore,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.120
 how we change that direction, how to reset that, that button, how we reset that is right now with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:07.990
 our motivation. Mind is, motivation means the mind, to set up the mind or motivation. Something

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.360
 nice,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.520
 something is lined up to the our, our nature. What that means, our nature, according to Buddhism,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:26.880
 Buddha's teaching, our nature of mind is calm, peaceful, loving-kindness, compassion, honest,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:38.480
 intelligence, smart. That is really nature. But however, due to our mistakes, we turn, twisted

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:47.120
 our nature. Really thinking we are doing something good, reality we are bouncing back to our head

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.040
 by our own priest, priest, and then we're making trouble. And that is, so therefore correct the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.360
 motivation always in the teaching mechanism. So correct the motivation, what is joy and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 appreciation. It's simple, nothing mystery. Joy and appreciation, being grateful, grateful.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.360
 Be happy. What do you have? If you are happy, what do you have? If we are happy, what do we have?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:27.040
 Then the next good things welcome. Because our intelligence, our smartness, our joyful effort,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.480
 all of us rise up nicely with joy and happy and content and then bring the abundance of the other

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 good things one after another. And we start with the sad and suffering, the melancholos and kind

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.920
 of like deep breaths, the blaming to our self. That won't lead the joy and happy and peace,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.200
 what we want. It will lead all those kinds of things related with that, that we know. And

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.320
 therefore, always in the teaching said, right, the correct motivation, joy and appreciation.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.920
 We have so many beautiful things that you all know and we all know. Many beautiful things

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.320
 to compare with many others, other beings, other people, to think of us, how much we have. And

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.760
 happy and joy and appreciate that what we have. Combine that really good heart within Buddhism,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.720
 known as bodhicitta, and that joy and good things of what we have. We think that to all the beings

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.720
 others have that may really sincerely from waking that to all the beings made their happiness,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.400
 peace and joy and free from suffering, the difficult troubles and whole world become the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.840
 peace and harmonious and calm. Really we hear that from heart is so important. We are making the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.880
 peace. You will that time we will become the one of the peacemaker of our own this world.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.640
 We started peace and harmony. The global peace started from us, not from going to front of us,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.520
 start from outside. So this peace bodhicitta and the joy and appreciate is the fundamental

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.040
 instrumental to bring the peace and harmony to the world too, in a larger level. It's true. So

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.240
 therefore, correct the motivation with the bodhicitta. And then today we are going to reflect in

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.880
 the teaching of the Buddha, particularly teaching on Amitabha and really wishing that may everybody

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.760
 one have to buy this, bring joy and peace, happiness, free from suffering is certain,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.440
 it's a trouble, difficult, all the challenges now ended up reaching that in the heart.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.000
 Those are known as in Buddhism, the essential Dharma. It's a Dharma that is. Of course,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.120
 it is a Buddhism terminology. It is a Dharma, but that love and the compassion and joy and

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:02.160
 appreciation is not occupied, reserved by the Buddhism. It is our basic nature, your basic

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.480
 nature. Reactivating and glorifying is good for you or good for me, good for the others,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.080
 good for our family members, good for our friends and all the neighbors too. So that we should

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.280
 activate that with those we were told. And then we discuss teaching of the Buddha. As he said,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.600
 Buddha give a rise with teaching how to benefit every living beings now and forever in the future.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.760
 And this that those old teachings are so special, but particularly today, what we are going to

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 discuss is teaching on the Amitabha that I saw already. We started a few weeks ago,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.920
 already started, and I'm going to show that again today. These teachings on the Amitabha,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.600
 what is known as poor causes that will take rebirth in the pure land of the Amitabhas.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:06.880
 That is the teachings today that we read what we are going to discuss. And this is also generally

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:17.840
 rebirth that you all know. Buddhism believes rebirth. And Buddhism also follow the logic,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:28.000
 reasoning. For example, the life is continuation. Life is a continuation. We have today that also

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.760
 indicating we have yesterday. And that also indicating the day before yesterday. And today

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:47.600
 came in a way because of yesterday. Today we are here. And this year, year 2021, that indicating

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:56.800
 last year, 2020. So it is change of the change of the continuation when year end, not the year

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:04.160
 ended, time ended. It's just a changing time. And the life is also like continuation as

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:14.080
 like, like, like time, like this, this changing. When we die, we live that time is changing,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:24.240
 but life is not ended. According to Buddhism, it's like time, time never end. Life never ends.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.280
 What means lives now? When we die, of course, we live the body. That is what in Buddhism,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:40.560
 often known, this body has a prior components, prior elements. Those are the earth, water,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:48.320
 prior wind, poor, and then we target with the space. Those are known as five. These five

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:56.640
 poor elements are, are rented in a way is a component. When we are concepted in the mother's

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.120
 womb, that time, those four elements are gathered support within the space of this,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:13.280
 within the stage, stage of the space or the sky. These all forms are formed. Now that continued.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.480
 And now we are here, and then one time that four element parting way, and then we are singled out.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:31.520
 What we are singled out is consciousness. Our mind is that will be continued. So who is really

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:41.680
 continuing from life to life, not this physical body, not this physical bones,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.880
 but the consciousness. Consciousness is when we think of consciousness. I mean,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:57.040
 you think to consciousness, what is consciousness? Can you figure out anything? We all have the

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:08.720
 consciousness or we all have the mind, but what is mind? Think. This is not just a Buddhist dogma.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.600
 If you think you become more intelligent, smart, not naive, not just believing blindfolded

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:26.160
 by our own kind of unknown situation, and then with the presumptions. Think. Where is my mind?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:36.240
 What is my mind? Mind is here right now, but mind is, can we touch? Can we hold? Can we grab?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:45.040
 Can we push? Can we bounce? Can mind blocks? Can block it? Can mind crush it?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:56.640
 None of those things can happen to mind. Therefore, mind will in a way indestructible.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:09.360
 This our mind is like light, like energy. It will continue. What will continue,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:20.000
 it carried the whole package of our memories, habit patterns, that is registered, imprinted

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:29.280
 in the clothes of the mind. I am using it as like modern time, eye clothes, example of eye clothes.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.000
 Maybe you know better be that way, eye clothes. But clothes of the mental space

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:46.480
 is registered, all that that imprinted. That package, all will carry. For example, our memories

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.320
 now. Of course, there is a lot of psychiatry, many of those analysis is in brains and all

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.920
 that things. But where that brains and all that, you really started thinking of that part of the

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:05.680
 brains. It's not, the memory is not best upon a code of Buddhism. It's not on best upon the

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:13.180
 channels and the nervous systems and the muscles. Muscles. It is absolutely best on the

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.160
 consciousness,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.280
 on the mental states. Mental states. Mental state is as I use example, eye clothes.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:30.720
 That is what really continue. Therefore, if we set up now, changing something mentally

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.160
 to connected to that, that will change the direction of the future.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.800
 Future. For that reason, then we do the meditation practices, cultivating more that

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:52.320
 hidden call it from mind, such as joy, love, compassion, calmness, loving, kind of peace,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:14:00.240
 harmony, all that we bring forth because those are the nature of the mind. It's natural.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:09.680
 And to activate that, then it will continually that bright, that confidence, that courage,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.960
 that calmness will continue. No matter what, every challenge you go through,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:21.760
 through even if it's alive, we have more calm, peaceful mind, external looks like really where

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:29.200
 it can be like terrible and not unpleasant, not, not pleasant and all terrible things.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.160
 But mentally, those many people who are calm and peaceful, they're calm, they're happy,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.280
 they're peaceful. They're more happy than those people who have self-surrender by all the luxuries,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:46.080
 luxury things. There's more calm, peaceful, joy, laughing, smiling, a lot of time, blind,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.200
 peace and joy, happiness, really. And those when they don't have the peace and happiness in mind,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.080
 even they're surrounded, all the luxuries, the atoms that existed in the world, still

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.880
 they are suffering and having difficulty. Then we see our own eyewitness. Why that happening?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.880
 What that means? What this means in the world? What is the answer for that?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.080
 And so therefore, thinking of this, this and changing to the direction of the future

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.360
 right now is so important. Those are just my kind of, you know, how important prison time.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.920
 And therefore, in the Buddhist teaching, always kind of talk about the correct motivation. So

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.560
 motivation of joy and peace, happiness, appreciation, and with this kindness,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.240
 compassion, thought for all living beings, wishing good things, really that is touched to our heart

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:42.240
,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.000
 the heart of the nature of the mind. And then it will help. It is tremendous, powerful,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.240
 meritorious and healing powers, all that. With that, then we do the practice and follow these

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:02.080
 teachings. Now, as I said the other day, the Buddha Shakyamuni told so many times about the

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.480
 Amitabha teachings, particularly in the Mahayana teaching and Vajrayana teachings, the Buddha told

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:16.080
 about the Amitabhas. Particularly, there is a famous suttara known as Amitabha suttara or suttara

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:24.480
 of the display of the pure land of the Amitabha, that Buddha Shakyamuni told at the Watcher's

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:32.400
 Peak Mountain. If you enter India, it is in Bihar now, Northern India. Bihar, there is called the

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.080
 Rajagiri, nearby Rajagiri. There is holy mountain known as Watcher's Peak Mountain, and where

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:48.560
 Buddha Shakyamuni and his disciples stayed so many years and gave so many profound teachings

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:57.280
 to that sport. So, this Amitabha teaching, also Buddha gave on that mountain. And surrounded by

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:06.560
 with 32,000 of the students, of the ordained students, the Arhadas, and so many, many,

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.520
 many, and Bodhisattvas, other Bodhisattvas, lay practitioners, and the Buddha gave these

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:22.000
 Amitabha teachings. So, this is an exhibit called Opa Mipi Hanyukopam do, or suttara of the display

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.000
,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.680
 the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha. So, that's what the Buddha gave. And the Buddha gave these

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:35.120
 teachings surrounded by so many of those students, but he kind of gave them, particularly, directly

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:44.000
 that teaching to his personal attendants known as Ananda, Ananda. And he gave this Ananda, he

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.480
 called

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.600
 Ananda, in continuous talk, Ananda, Ananda. I mean, throughout the teaching that he's

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:56.320
 most kind of giving the teaching, but same time, Ananda is also asking questions, and Buddha

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.840
 answering that. So, in a way, dialogue of the teaching that he started to give teachings.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:10.240
 So, in that teaching, Buddha said, and now, for example, to now, when we're thinking of the two,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:18.000
 when we're thinking of the two, to benefit to our self and benefit all living beings,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.080
 to propel that goal. Then, Buddha gave so many teachings, as I said, and you all know that,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.880
 Buddha gave with practice, so many different practices, meditation, and many variety of the

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.960
 meditation, and all that, all that teaching. But among those all teaching, and particularly,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:42.880
 among the Mahayana suttara, Amitabha practice and Amitabha is mostly swept in the easy

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:50.240
 approach to get enlightenment, to propel our goal of the bodhicattam. And the teaching said,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:57.600
 this is, in the suttara Mahayana teaching, and to get Buddhahood, to get enlightenment, it takes

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:07.440
 so many eons to reach enlightenment. But practice on Amitabha is really processed one to propel

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:14.240
 goal of the bodhicattam, and the benefit to our self in all other beings. So, therefore,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:23.360
 this is considering one of the really past, easy, convenience, and method to really

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.680
 propel our goal and help to the other beings, to propel bodhicattas. So, therefore, this is

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.880
 so important. Buddha Shakyamuni told to get, to take the rebirth in the period of Amitabha,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:44.880
 there is poor causes, poor conditions. What Buddha said in the teaching, or Ananda,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:53.440
 some other practice, or in some individually, or maybe not that way, Ananda, whoever,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:04.000
 whoever think Buddha Amitabha again and again, again, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.720
 yeah, Amitabha in the period and again and again, and then, and performing, second,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:22.560
 performing lot of meditation activities, and third, and developing the bodhicattas,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:31.900
 and with the aspirations, or the development of bodhicattas, and dedicating merit for all the

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.240
 beings,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:43.520
 and fourth is lateral aspiration prayer that may I reborn in the period of Amitabha with all,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:51.280
 and as well as all the sentient beings, ever you do that. And that individually, when is the time

00:20:51.280 --> 00:21:00.320
 come, he said in the teaching, when time come that he is, that individual is nearing the end

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:08.480
 of life, or near the end of life, he will, or that is not just he, whoever thinking that that

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:08.880
 person

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:18.080
 will see Buddha Amitabha, as well as all the rationals and disciples, see right in front of

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.880
 that individual who is in nearly ending of the end of the life, and that will be, that individual

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.440
 be

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:33.680
 so happy, peaceful, not frightened by the death, death situation, and with their clear mind,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:41.200
 he will pass away and take the birth in the period of Amitabha. That Buddha Shakyamuni himself

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:50.080
 said in the teaching, teaching. So now to make clear that, what it stated, that stated poor causes,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:59.440
 to every perform these poor cause or conditions, that will take us to rebirth in the period of

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:08.560
 Amitabha. And that is, fourth is to remembering of the period of the Amitabha and Amitabha

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:17.280
 Buddha himself. That is the fourth. And with that thought, performing lot of

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:27.120
 meditory activities, second, meditory activities, that is second. Third is developing the bodhicata

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.120
,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:35.040
 or having bodhicata thought in the heart and the mind, and that is third. Fourth is

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:44.320
 really lateral aspiration prayer and a dedicated merit to be born in the period of Amitabha.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:54.240
 So those are known as poor causes to take rebirth in the devotee. So therefore, according to the

00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.880
 teaching, if you have that thought, intention, there is nothing big concentration, big meditation,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:09.600
 meditation you needed, because merely thinking of the Amitabha and doing good activities with good

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:19.120
 heart and spraying that may myself and all the beings to take the rebirth in the period of Amitabha

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.120
.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:27.760
 Wishing that alone will take the rebirth in the period of Amitabha. So that is really what is

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:36.080
 poor causes. Now we go a little bit to detail and highlight. I'm sure you have this page,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.720
 I believe you all have this. This is called "Press to the Amitabha with Mantra". I'm sure you have

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:42.960
 that.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:52.160
 I will highlight this. So these poor causes, what we discussed here, poor causes that. For here,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:24:00.400
 for example, blessed one, thus gone, subduous and immediate, perfectly fully enlightened,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:10.880
 protector Amitabha, Amitabha, that is what? Remember Amitabha and this is among the poor causes,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:20.960
 this is, under here, is first cause. Remember Amitabha. So that means, and we go details on this,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:29.120
 I'm going to go more details on this, but that is the first cause, remembering of the Amitabha.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:38.880
 That is, second is what the cause, performing a lot of meritor activities, merit activities,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:46.000
 meritor activities. Again, of course, this is, many of you should know that. I think you all know,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.280
 you're, I'm sure, you're practicing, practicing, starting learning that. But there's two merits,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:58.720
 accumulation merit, what's the merit? It's both merits, a lot of merit is performing.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:07.440
 And this case here, what is? And merit is here in the English. To you, I pay homage,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:20.240
 make offerings, go for refuge. That is meritor activities. That is taking merit cause,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:30.080
 cause to take the merit. That is meritor activities, meritories. And that is, again,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:36.480
 we go over of this. Of course, you all know that, but I will go over those, those meanings too. But

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:47.920
 that is third, first and the second. Third is, is, then with the bodhijattas. That means that,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:54.000
 hold this prayer, start with bodhijatta. You have good heart and good intention toward thinking of

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.080
 all the living beings we are doing prayer. So therefore it is, even though it's not so clearly

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:09.520
 highlight of the bodhijatta, part means that here, please bless me, bless, bless me this time,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:17.600
 me and all the living beings. Please bless me and all the living beings. That is bodhijatta.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:26.560
 Bodhijatta means so that is the third cause. Then bless me and take the rebirth, and

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:35.360
 take rebirth or bless me and take the rebirth, rebirth myself, all the living beings in the

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.880
 pure land of the Devotee, Amitabh, pure land. That is the fourth cause and having a lot of

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:52.720
 aspiration prayers, aspiration prayers and dedications. So that is, this one is explaining

00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:02.960
 of the four causes, causes and that is how this is. So that is the first one. And now this one,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:11.200
 again, we go with this. Now how we think of this first is, first is we're thinking of the pure land

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:19.200
 Amitabh and pure land Amitabh with reflecting right in front of us. That many of you already know

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:27.280
 Buddha Amitabh. Buddha Amitabh is the same as the Bodhijaktamuni with one face, two arms,

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:34.400
 and two legs, legs, and sitting with the lotus posture or the radial posture that you all know.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:42.080
 But what is here is the color is different, right? Red colors. And Buddha Amitabh is sitting with

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.080
 the

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:49.680
 economic mudras, economic mudras like this. Mudras, and in the teachings said Buddha Amitabh,

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:55.360
 which direction is Buddha Amitabh? According to the teaching is in the western direction.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:03.280
 Western direction, how far? In Buddhism, again, the Bodhijaktamuni give so many teachings

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:10.080
 that there is so many universes. Our world is of course we are like one universe or whatever this

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.580
 world, but this is not just the only one. There is so many countless, in the teachings said

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.160
 countless,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:26.400
 we can't put numbers. There is so many countless universes, every direction. That means the east,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:37.040
 west, and south, north, every direction. There are so many universes. So, brilliant Amitabh,

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:45.040
 where is Amitabh now? It's the western direction of our world, in the western direction. How far?

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:53.920
 And again in the Buddha's teaching said the countless universes, far beyond countless universes,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:04.160
 universe, countless universes. And that pure land, beyond there, there is a universe known as

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:14.720
 pure land Amitabh or in Sanskrit, that pure land is there. This is right now

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:24.160
 that pure land there. And Buddha Amitabh, that means right now, Buddha Amitabh is a living Buddha.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.640
 Right now there. And how that is, according to teaching, teaching this pure land of Amitabh

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:43.360
 is a slightly higher than attitude or slightly higher than our this universe or our this world

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:51.040
 where we are, let it higher. And there is pure land Amitabh. Now I'm using pure land Amitabh,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:30:05.520
 but in Sanskrit and in English I think translated land of bliss, blissful, land of peace and

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:14.560
 harmonious. Land of peace and harmonious. Why this land of peaceful harmony? Because there is no

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:21.920
 suffering, the difficulty, even the names existing in that pure land. Every day it's just pure,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:32.400
 no suffering, no sad, no difficulty, no getting old, no sicknesses, no troubles, no corolling,

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:43.440
 fighting, arguing, clashing, and worries, sad, and all that really no, no emotions are activating,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.680
 such as anger, jealous, hated thoughts, and hesitation, doubt, skeptical. All those are

00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:03.680
 completely reduced. Don't. There's no active. Everything is gone. So what is there? Therefore

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.960
 then peace, harmony, respect, appreciation. Everything is so beautiful, comfortable.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.000
 Whatever you desire, that comes right there. Those desires are not mixed with the emotions,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.240
 desires of the happy, peace, compassion, loving kindness, respect and appreciation, kindness.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:34.480
 And it's just so perfect and beautiful, so comfortable, and really comfortable. There is

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:42.000
 no like kind of summer and winter, these hard things. Everything is just completely perfect

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.800
 seasons. And the teaching said if you want to be cool, immediately coolness comes. If you want to

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.360
 be

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:57.120
 warm, immediately warmness comes. And when you are kind of, we like to be surrounded by so many

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:05.920
 flowers. There's so many flowers, beautiful flowers. And those flowers are so many beautiful colors

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.480
,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:14.560
 and so many beautiful bees, and birds, and trees, and vegetation, the fruit, and everything. And

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:14.880
 that

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:21.920
 fragrance and peace is just really so perfect. And there is so, really what gracious teacher

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:30.880
 Buddha said, really there is no name of suffering exist at all. For that reason, land of Sukhavati,

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:41.200
 is everything is calm and peaceful happiness. Why that happened? Because aspiration and

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:48.640
 commitment and the fulfillment of the Buddha Amitabha when he was bodhisattvas. As he said

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:55.600
 earlier, the last time, Buddha Amitabha was born, once upon a time, as a great courageous,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:03.600
 kindness, compassion, smart bodhijata, or thinking of all being bodhisattvas. Then he accumulated

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:10.800
 merit in which he met so many aspirations one after another. So then when he fulfilled all the

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:19.840
 aspirations, he was born as being Buddha Amitabha, and land become the Sukhavatis. So it's all

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.040
 these

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:29.040
 aspirations. Buddha Amitabha said, "Who ever hear his names with good thought, may that

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.320
 individually

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:37.520
 take the birth in my land or my pure land. May never, whoever born in this my pure land,

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:44.240
 they never return back to samsara. And from that on, they are the path to the enlightenment,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:50.800
 to the higher realization, one after another." Really he met all those aspiration prayers,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:58.720
 and aspiration prayers, and he met, accumulated merit, and he fulfilled that goal. Then he

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:06.080
 become the Buddha. So then therefore, land of pure land is, Amitabha is so pure, so perfectly

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:13.250
 beautiful. Because his commitment, his aspirations, even we just merely think of him and reaching

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.280
 to

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:19.440
 be born that pure land, then we are making connections in the teachings, connections,

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:27.520
 and we will go there surely, that we will take the birth. Because as I said early in Buddhism,

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:36.480
 life is not ended when we die. It's just changing. We're changing the chapter, changing the

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.280
 sections of the page, but we continue. Our life of the page, lives of the page,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:50.880
 continue to turn one after another. Book is not ended there. It continues. And this time,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.280
 we turn our page to the pure land Amitabha, along with all our other practices.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:04.960
 Wishing that will become the cause to birth, to take the rebirth in pure land with devotees.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.000
 If somehow every practice is so diligently beautiful, perfectly in this life, a rich

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.120
 enlightenment within this lifetime, then that's perfect. Excellent. But still so many great

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:24.080
 masters really take the birth in pure land with devotees. For example, that among the great master,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:31.360
 master, great philosopher, great like physics or counter physics and philosophy in Buddhism,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:39.280
 Nagarjuna also really won't take the birth in the pure land Amitabha. He make and he last wrote,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:47.360
 one of the last wrote, he said, now I will go. That means Nagarjuna, he said, now I will go to

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:56.800
 the pure land Amitabha. He said himself, so he that and so many other great masters. So all that

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:04.320
 is really the pure land. So now merely thinking of this pure land and with the Buddha Amitabha,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.480
 how we should think the Buddha Amitabha in a teaching said, Buddha Amitabha is sitting

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:22.960
 on the 1,000 petal lotus and the moon dusk, that is supported, that throne, that throne

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:31.760
 is supported by at peacocks, at peacocks. So that means two peacocks in each direction. So that lot

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.320
us

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.760
 is supported by the four directions, four directions, each direction there is two peacocks.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:46.960
 Two peacocks on the front, two peacocks on the right side, two peacocks on the back side,

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:59.680
 two peacocks, peacocks on the left side, and that peacock supported by this lotus. Above that lotus

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:09.200
 and then there's moon, moon, moon dusk or moon cushion. And above that, Buddha Amitabha is sitting

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:18.480
 with the Vidyar vosyas, you all know, and facing to us, facing to you, whoever is facing to you,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:30.080
 Buddha Amitabha is like so beautiful, glorious, and kind, calm, kind, compassion, loving kindness,

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:38.400
 and radiating light of love and compassion to us, to all the living beings, and looking to us with

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:47.040
 his eye of compassion, love to us, us really looking to them. And that is, and it is like 32

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.560
 major marks, 80 minor marks, those old Buddha's manner, that's, it's a voice, it's beautiful,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:02.320
 love, compassion, kindness, soothing, calming. The moment we hear the voice, it is just like

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:09.440
 radiating teachings of the truth, and that's saying to our heart and mind is that. And heart is

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.760
 completely filled with love and compassion for all sentient beings without any, any discriminations

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:15.920
 or

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:23.920
 the partialities, that, that is Buddha Amitabha as a glowing light, rainbow light of the red colors

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:23.920
,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:33.120
 like red color as like ruby, ruby, but with glowing light with that, that. And his right side is

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:40.160
 genetics, Avalokiteshara, Compassion Buddha, Bodhisattva, Compassion, and white color,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:49.360
 standing, standing in his right side. And his left side is the Bajarpanim, Tujinto in the teaching

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:56.960
 said, Tujinto, powerful ones, powerful one, in the color is blue. So Amitabha is red,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:06.400
 and Gilezi is white, and Tujinto or the Bajarpani is blue. Both are standing on the lotus.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:16.480
 And both are in the right hand is mother of the protections, protection and leaning,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:22.720
 these palms like held up like this, toward this, his right side, their, their right sides,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:31.440
 and the left hand Avalokiteshara, here is a hold, the lotus, and that opens around, around the

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:43.360
 white lotus, opens the blooms or opens his level of the ears, left ears. And the Bajarpani, also

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.340
 right hand is a protection mother, same gesture as Gilezi, and the left hand holding the blue lotus

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:52.560
,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:40:00.720
 that which opens around the level of his left ears. All those are known as the three principle

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:08.560
 object of the pure land of Amitabha, and looking to eye, all of us with the eye of love,

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:17.200
 comparison of us. And the Buddha Amitabha is this light leaning, or behind the Buddha Amitabha

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:24.800
 is the Bodhi trees. Bodhi tree, which is so beautiful, perfectly shimmering, lightening.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.440
 And the Buddha Shakyamuni's and the teaching said, when this Bodhi tree, when you see,

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:38.240
 it will dispel all the sickness of the eyes. Have you heard this bird? So many days birds,

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:46.720
 and trees are like, what's called the leaves, leaves are moving by the wind. It really makes

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:53.440
 beautiful charming, charming, or it is songs. If you heard that song, that sickness and the

00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:01.200
 troubles of the ear is completely gone. And when you hear, smell the fragrance of the Bodhi tree,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:08.240
 then the Buddha Amitabha is leaning. Smell that, that will dispel all the troubles of the noses,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:18.960
 noses. And when you, when you have the taste, this Bodhi tree has so many fruits and all

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:26.960
 delicious, frag, beautiful fruit. If you taste that fruit, it will dispel the troubles of the

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:33.840
 tongues and the voices. And if you have the feeling of the Bodhi tree and the touch,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:41.040
 that it really well dispels the sickness of the physicals. If you think of this Bodhi tree,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:48.320
 of all that call it, you bring calm and peace in the mind and hearts. So that is the call of the

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:57.200
 Bodhi trees. And Bodha Amitabha is leaning under, leaning with that Bodhi trees. With all those of

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.960
 this life, trees are glowing with the light and all the humerus. And the Bodha Amitabha is

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:10.720
 surrounded by the, with so many Bodhi sattvas, Bodhi sattvas, the disciples, those are all in

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.800
 the form of the Arhathas and the great sage. There's so many beautifuls. This, so that is

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.120
 really Bodhi Amitabha. The Bodhi Amitabha is so powerful, so glowing light. The glowing light

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:29.600
 cannot be measured by anyone. And therefore it is known as Amitabha. In Sanskrit, Amitabha,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:37.440
 in English, I think translated, "Buddha of limitless light." Limit light. It has no

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.760
 measurement of glowing light. So powerful light. Light of love in a comparison of Muslims.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:51.200
 The lifespan of the Bodhi Amitabha also has no measurement. It's forever in a way. And for that

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:58.480
 reason, known as Bodhi Amitabha's name, Amitayu, Bodhi Amitayu. So the Bodhi Amitayu or Amitabha

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:05.680
 is the same Bodhi. And therefore also the glowing state, glowing, the glories of the Bodhi Amitabha

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.520
 has no measurement. Those are all world of the Bodhi Shaktamuni when he gives his speech in the

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:19.200
 Water Spring Mountains. Has no measurements. Therefore is known as in the Tibet, as the

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.120
 Deep Army. There's no measurement of the glories. It's just so, so glowing, so majestic, so

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:27.840
 glorious

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:35.520
 that. So this is like, and then also the Pure Land is so, cannot be explained. Bodhi Shaktamuni

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:35.920
 said

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:43.680
 in the teaching, "Ananda, I cannot explain the whole quality and beauties of the Amitabha.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:52.160
 Even I explain the whole, this eons still is not completed. Even he explained about the quality of

00:43:52.160 --> 00:44:00.000
 the Pure Land Amitabha for one eon, but still is not all completed." That's what Buddha said.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:09.280
 It's so massive. Therefore it is just like Pure Land, of the infinite qualities. That water in

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:16.800
 the teaching said, hundreds of millions, I think in it is counted, Buddha counted,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:27.680
 so hundreds, hundreds billions of the Pure Land qualities that I'm translating that you can check

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:34.800
 carefully in those. So many Amitabha prayers are so, so popular in the, particularly in the Tibet

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:40.480
 Buddhism or in Mahayana Buddhism. And also, particularly there's a very famous master,

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:47.520
 the Amitabha practitioners in the Yogi and scholars known as Raga Aksi, Karakarma Chami.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:53.600
 His prayer of the Pure Land of Devach is so popular, both in the Inuma schools,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:59.600
 the Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Kaju, Kaju in the Inuma schools. Really so popular. And there,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:06.080
 he said so beautifully, perfectly that, said that so, so if I translate roughly those numbers of

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.080
 the

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:15.440
 Pure Land, he counted that maybe at billions, at billions and so forth of the Pure Land,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:23.360
 call it, in their luxuries, are all combined together as one single Pure Land and that which

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:30.880
 is Pure Land or Amitabha. The old beauties, all the majesties, all the comfort, all the beauty,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:38.320
 all piled up one single to the Pure Land, that is Pure Land or Amitabha. So that is so beautiful.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.040
 So that is what we're going to reflect the Pure Land there. That is, in a way, somehow every day

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.880
 reach enlightenment within this life through our other practices such as Zuktin meditation and all

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:58.160
 that, but all those practices, meditation, zukin, Mahamudra, Mademaka, two practices and

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:04.960
 poor practice, transferring, conquering practice, all that combine together and that lead, push,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:12.320
 this mediturity activity, that will push us to take the birth of Devachins. Along with our

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.720
 this prayer, what we symbol the Buddha taught, these poor causes, suppose thinking of the Pure Land

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:25.600
 and thinking of the Pure, Buddha Amitabha is the first cause to take the rebirth in the Devachins.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:32.320
 And that is really, I'm talking, and now then, of course, we go over more kind of this next time.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:41.920
 But the second is, now accommodate the merits. Accumulating a lot of merits and

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.840
 dedicating that merit to be born in the Pure Land and Devachins, ourself and all the beings.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:47:00.800
 Wishing that. Accumulating merit. What is merit? Merit is the activity of your good heart.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.920
 What is a good heart? Loving kindness, compassion,

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:14.720
 and joy and apprehension and respect to the others. With that attitude, with that thought,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:24.480
 whatever deed you're doing, by physically and by verbally, by mentally, that is good deed.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:31.600
 That is mediturity. Mediturity is not something kind of like mystery or something different kind

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:40.000
 of dogma. It's the activity of our good heart. Simple to tell, good heart. And when in samsara,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.960
 in the world, when people say, "Oh, he or she has good heart," what that means, actually,

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:53.040
 because that person must have love, kindness, more honesty, more truth. Do nice things for the

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:53.360
 others.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:01.920
 Then people called good heart. They had the same thing here, but a little more larger levels here.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:08.320
 That good heart for all the beings, thinking of everyone, really. Not just only the village,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:16.480
 our family members, only the people we met, but even we didn't see things. But we think everyone,

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:26.320
 because every single living being is struggling with the troubles. And every single living being

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:33.520
 has the same intention, to be happy, to be peace, to be fulfilled, something performance,

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:42.000
 yet not completing, fulfilling, struggling. Great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.640
 "People may be thinking they're trying to do the good things, yet maybe they're croaking their

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:55.040
 own happiness by their own mistakes, their own misdeeds, because due to the unknowing,

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.200
 and we don't see. Thinking of something I'm doing good for me, or to my family,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.840
 but reality, maybe it's turning opposite direction." That happened many times. So really,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:17.680
 everyone has wisdom. Everyone has joy, peace, happiness. Everyone has good common senses,

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:23.760
 sensibles, respect, and appreciation. Don't, from the ground, build up good thought,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:30.720
 and really weaken with that. Those are all known as good activities, medical activities,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:37.320
 and then larger activities, medical activities, such as six-part-of-mata practices. Six-part-of-m

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.520
ata

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:47.880
 practice. And then in the teaching, said also such as... So those are all active medical activities

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:47.920
,

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:55.280
 and that... So now what we discussed today, really I discussed today about among the four causes

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:02.800
 of the first one, what gracious teacher Buddha said, "Honored whoever thinking of the Buddha

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:11.840
 and Amitabha again and again in the pure land." That was one of the causes among the four causes.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:19.440
 So what I discussed today, really about the pure land of Amitabha and Amitabha, and with

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:28.560
 the Jainese or the Avalokiteshora, and as well as the Japani and then pure land. So that is my

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.600
 brief talk for today, and thank you very much. And tomorrow, again, we will continue the talk.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:40.480
 The second cause, we start again then, and then I like to go over this prayer that what you got.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:49.780
 And also this has poor those causes, poor causes. Each of those really has that. So the first one

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.000
 is

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.320
 shorter and shorter and with this prayer, you join the Amitabha Mantra on Amitavari. If you have

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:58.720
 time

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.280
 and then joined the second one, and also you do the Amitabha as a mantra that if you have time,

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:12.400
 then do this next one, do the again this prayer. Again, each of those all are to take the rebirth

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:21.200
 in pure land. It has all those poor causes, and I will go over that and kind of highlight each of

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:27.920
 those, according to my capabilities to you. And thank you very much again for participating, and

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:35.200
 we do continue now. We do just one moment meditate a short time, or the one moment we

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:42.080
 stay silent, and we do the short dedication prayers. And then after that, we're going to do

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:49.280
 again, our concluding evening practices of the of the Pema Samyal we used to do here. So we

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.720
 like to conclude, and with that we will do some prayers, of course, divide many

00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.760
 individuals. At that time, I will read and we'll do prayers. So that's what our sessions are for.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:07.840
 So now we do short meditation, or one moment meditation, and then dedicate the short dedication.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.080
 So, I will start with the first one.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:52.080
 [Silence]

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:22.080
 [Silence]

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:30.080
 By this merit, may all attending the omniscient meet, join from the stormy...

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.080
 [Cough]

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.080
 From the oil of the samsara, may I betray all beings.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.080
 [Silence]
