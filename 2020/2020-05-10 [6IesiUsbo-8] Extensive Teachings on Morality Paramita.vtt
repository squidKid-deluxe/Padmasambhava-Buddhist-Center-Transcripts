00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.200
 Thank you very much, everyone, for coming today. Thank you again. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.240
 Again, we will continue the teachings and the words of the great Master Yabji.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.760
 Do you remember me as a great teacher? But I talk. And as well as practice by all those great pract

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880
icers and great practices,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.120
 all great masters, the practice and the elite enlightenment. So we are following them.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.720
 It's still in that same passage, that. And then we activate, and we come, and we try to catch up,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 try to let clarification on our practice and meditation. So that's what we will be doing.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.000
 Again, with those, all that reasons, we should rest in our joy and appreciation and bodhicata

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.800
 thought.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.240
 Thought and to all living beings that I'm going to reflect on the teaching.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.160
 Teaching, because I like to benefit all living beings to remove their suffering, the difficulties

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.720
 or

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 to remove their cause of the suffering truth and the suffering truth. And bring totally the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.160
 actually enlightenment status, all totally peace and happiness, the ultimate goal or desire of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.480
 every

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.120
 living beings. So I really like to bring that for that reason, that I'm going to practice, edit it,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.280
 and activate it of the teaching. Those are our, those intention with that intention. Then

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.320
 now we go to our teachings. And today, again, we continue to go on this topic, which is

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 lay out as like post noble, second noble, and third noble. And even though it is kind of false,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 the second and third, reality, they're all collected. Isn't that something that totally

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.120
 different from each other's all is revealing every point is revealing our innate true nature,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 our positive attitude and thought and kindness, compassion that is reflected all things directly

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.520
 in their day. That's the reality. Teaching is all about. So now with that prayer, again,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 we discussed those forced motivation or post noble, and let me explain extensively, very slowly and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.560
 then, and now we're going in the middle of that, the principle noble. Principle noble is the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.120
 principle

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 practices. And then again, in that case, what we say is like actually in the Bodhisattva teaching,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.760
 it is actualizing bodhicitta or actualizing bodhisattvas or actualizing bodhicitta, sorry,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.360
 actualizing bodhicitta. And that is really what is all. And how do you actualize the bodhicitta

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.920
 in the teaching is through the six parameters. Again, this six parameter is not something

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.640
 completely different from each other. All connected, all are lined up. As we discussed the other

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.120
 day,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.440
 everything one after another is really connected. Even one single parameter contains the old six

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 parameters. So it's not different from the reality of all. And now that way, we went among the six

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.440
 parameters, the first parameter, the generous parameters. Today, we are in a morality parameter,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:59.320
 or a shila parameter. Shila parameter is a principle part of the practices of the Bodhisattvas.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.000
 Once you develop the bodhicitta, then you practice the shila parameters.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.240
 Shila parameter, as I said, and you all know, can be divided into three sections, three groups.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.000
 That shila parameter or the morality parameter, that way avoiding all the negativities.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.600
 That is number one. Second is morality that will gathering all the virtues.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.640
 That means what virtues? Dharma. All the dharma, all the teachings are gathering.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.800
 Where? To our mind streams, to our knowledge, to our understanding. Bring that beautiful

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.400
 treasure of the teaching, teaching into the spotlight of our own mind or knowledge. Gather it.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:10.040
 And then third morality. The fourth is avoiding all the negativities. Second morality is gathering

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:20.440
 all the virtues or the dharmas. Dharmas. And the third is benefiting for all the living beings,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.400
 morality that will benefit for all living beings. Now you think this three is known as electric

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 moralities also. Subdivision of the moralities. But reality, it encompasses entirely teaching,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:47.960
 or teaching of the practices. Practice. It encompasses entirely teaching of this

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:56.200
 the Jyabji Duryumudya's teaching. Entirely. That all is within this three morality. In that sense,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.880
 all the rest of the parameters. What that means is rest of the parameters. The patient parameters,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:12.920
 during forever two parameters. Concentrate on your parameters. Most of the parameters,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.040
 any generous parameter is all in these morality parameters.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:30.760
 That is really how complexity, how profound, how deep it is. It is. Now again I will go over this.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:38.520
 This. Who is this morality that will avoid all the negativities?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:52.200
 That encompasses entire vows of the buddhist teachings. Vowels, samayas. All the vinayaktam,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.760
 the basic Buddhist school vinaya rules, is within there. And sutramahayana is vows,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:09.380
 or bodhisattva is vows within there. And many other vows or samayas within that post the moralities

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.560
.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.240
 Morality that will avoid all the negativities.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:25.800
 All the negativities. Directly, indirectly. Enforced morality of the vinaya teachings.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:36.200
 What is teachings? Avoid all the negative action. Negative activities. Directly, indirectly

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:47.560
 to all the living beings. That is essence of the first vows or the vinaya vows. Essence.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.960
 Essence. That's it. Avoid harmful actions.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:05.000
 Negativities that will hurt others. Directly, indirectly. Why am I saying hurt others?

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:13.240
 Because Mahayana is best of compassion. Bodhicatha is best absolutely on compassion

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:22.600
 and loving kindness and wisdom. Therefore, we remember, we discussed even taking

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:32.170
 refuge in Mahayana. Primary purpose is compassion. Primary cause of the taking refuge is compassion

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.360
.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:42.040
 That is a specialist of Mahayana. Mahayana has two Mahayana. Suttramahayana, Vedayana Mahayana.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:52.200
 So it's all compassion. Therefore, avoiding negativities. Directly, indirectly to all the

00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:01.000
 beings. That also of course indicated to you or to our side too. Because we have to be strong,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.080
 we have to be more well-equipped to help benefit and grow ourselves so we can be really

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.040
 well-prepared, well-growed, build up the strength to benefit for all beings.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:23.400
 Therefore, this is the one. The entire vinaya guidelines are complete within this.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:33.720
 Then Mahayana vowels, always in the teaching, above the vinaya vowels.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.200
 Basically, this is called vowels. Above that, keeping that. That means keeping that, add one more.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:48.120
 Suttramahayana vowels. It's benefiting. Performing the beneficial activities for all the living

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.520
 beings.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.040
 Directly, indirectly. By, again, both each other.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:04.120
 Performing beneficial activities to benefit to every living being. Directly, indirectly,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:12.360
 according to our capabilities. That encompasses entirely

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:22.040
 bodhicata vowels or bodhisattva vowels. It encompasses everything.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:31.400
 Now that. And above that, that means above the vinaya vowels, above the bodhisattva vowels,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:40.520
 and vediana vowels. Sing everything or realizing everything as in three various states.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:50.680
 Whether a form, whether a song, whether a space or mind. Everything. All body,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.320
 speech, mind of enlightenment. Body, speech, mind, enlightenment of buddha is not just

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:06.680
 a kind of isolated one single group from others. The entire little. Entirely. What is involved?

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:15.400
 On the teaching said, poem, song, space, and mind. That's it. There's nothing else.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:26.440
 Poem, song, space, and mind. The whole, all forms are enlightened poems. Poems.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:37.560
 And all the songs are enlightened songs. All the space, or not all, space and mind

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:47.880
 is enlightened space. Enlightened. It's enlightened. It's wisdom. Ordinary enlightened. It's not

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.200
 something

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.880
 that we're making this enlightenment because we are practicing. Because it's enlightened,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:05.560
 we are revealing. That's what it is according to the teaching. So that means that is the essence

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:13.720
 of the entire Vadiyana vowels. So therefore, the fourth one, avoiding all the naked witches,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:25.720
 directly, directly of the morality. That encompasses entirely vows of the entire buddha teachings.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.600
 And vows of the buddha teaching is best about the human ethics or good ethics.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:41.160
 Human ethics, generally Buddhism, is the foundation of the buddha's ethics or guidelines,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:49.240
 moralities. It's not something that buddha taught us kind of completely different things. Things

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:58.440
 separated from the tradition, good ethics, all characters of the world, other humans.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:09.480
 It's not. Good ethics, good character stress of the human world is very foundation of the buddha's

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:18.280
 moralities. And then what buddha did? Buddha glorified that. More laboratory. More glorified,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:27.960
 more laboratory. Laboratory so that we can be safe on the storm, pure and clean, humble and

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.160
 simple and move forward with full joy and appreciation and all those beautiful tools

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.720
 that really come one after another. Unfolding the treasures are opening one after another.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.800
 When you open one treasure of the mind, it opens another one and opens another. It comes,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.680
 the treasure of the richness of the fresh mind is just coming. And then one in the teaching said,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.720
 when you reach higher realization, there's hundreds of doors of the realization and the samadhi

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.280
 powers

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:07.320
 are on, all day, one after another. Those are the teachings said. So that is what really it is.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:15.320
 So with that understanding, now today we are going to talk about this second moralities,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:27.000
 which is gathering all the rituals, morality that gathering all the rituals that I'm translating.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.240
 But as I said, rituals is done. Teaching. Good, good things. Good is good for me,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:44.440
 is good for the others. That means others, all the living beings. Not just select the Guru others.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:54.280
 All the beings is good. That morality we gather. That is practicing of the dharma.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:03.960
 Together to re-clarify, reactivate, glorify. So it's, it's, it's, it's saturated to our mind

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:10.840
 streams that what Buddha rains, it rains in our heart, in our realization. It then really deepening

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:18.760
 and glorifying them. So that is gathering. One after another, gathering. And what are those?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:25.240
 Then gathering all the teachings of the basic Buddhist schools, Theravada teachings,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:34.680
 Sotramahayana teachings, Vedayana teachings. Teachings all gathering. One after another,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:42.120
 continuing gathering. In the practice level, we're gathering and maintaining, keeping up the three,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:51.000
 those three extraordinary practices. Again, morality, concentration, and resistance.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.420
 And more of the mental level, what we are keeping up. The bodhicitta. All is best upon the bodhic

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.760
itta.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:06.360
 Loving, kindness, compassion, wisdom. And with that, we are doing accumulation Mary,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:14.290
 Western Mary practices. Gather those all things. Whatever we can gather. Just really build up,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.520
 build

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:23.240
 up, file up, file up, register our self-confident storehouse, or register our mental self storage

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:30.520
 status, storage status, continually kind of burning up that, burning up that. And those are then

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:30.840
 known

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.520
 as, such as in the practical meditation level, start with mindfulness. Again, of course,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:45.000
 foundation of the bodhicitta. With mindfulness and shamatha practices, vipashana meditations. And

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.080
 in

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:51.720
 the Vedayana teaching, known as the Kriyasya, Kriyasya study practices, complete study practices,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:58.840
 and that's supported by all the other tools of the paramatas. Supported, activated, built up,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:07.080
 so calm, so peacefully, so nicely, not clashing, not pulsing, back and forth. We're just relaxed,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.160
 really. We are seeing the crucial of the enlightenment in the space of dharma dharmas.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:22.520
 And then at once continually activating that. That is known as then, known as gathering all the

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.880
 virtues, and all the dharmas. So in this case, and according to his own religion, which is teaching

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:29.880
,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.760
 here, start with this one, in the page one, you look, what, you look, page one against it.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:48.680
 And the, what's it called, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, it's seven lines. One in

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:58.120
 the Kriyasya study, in the seventh line of this teaching. And do not mistake about resolve the

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:07.000
 virtues and unvirtues. Here, this is, this is the essence of the teaching, what I'm talking about,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.480
 the moralities. Avoiding all the negativeities. Morality there will avoid all the negativeities.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.920
 That is, and so this is, again, if we talk more about this, it's also karma, law of karma,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:31.640
 observing the karma, and avoiding negativeities. Negativeities started from our mental states.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:40.680
 It's negative emotions. Negative emotions that is best up on grasping, or ignorance, and ego

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:47.880
 clinging. When that reflecting on the emotional level, then it's known as attachment, anger,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:55.160
 geros, arrogance, doubt, and hesitations. Then it becomes confidential to so many

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:02.360
 anxieties, worry, the skeptical that all untold, one afternoon, that is known as the beginning of

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:09.400
 samsaras. That is the beginning of the dilemma and confusion of samsaras, samsara. So therefore,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:18.040
 avoiding from the cause, not trying to chase each of those emotions, but avoiding from the cause.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:26.280
 The greatest teacher, Buddha Shapte Mouni pointed out so clearly, that we upload from the mind,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:35.320
 which is cause, it will upload everything. Everything. So therefore, relax. All the tools

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:43.080
 that the Buddha taught, mindfulness, self-restraint, mindfulness, alertness, consciousness,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:53.960
 all those tools used, trying to avoid, and will not activate it. Even is mentally kind of bubbling

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.880
 that, but through the mindfulness, through the strength of our practice, not projecting that

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:06.360
 through the verbal and physical to the external, hurting someone, and hurting one's own self.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.920
 That is treated. So if we are able to do that, that means that we are good practitioners.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:25.560
 Sign the practitioners is reaching the antidote at the time, at the time, reaching the antidote

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:34.120
 at the time before it made a mess. Mess. That is good. In the Dokti teaching, I want to say,

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:46.680
 liberating as it arises. Liberating as it is arising from the mental state, write that sport

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:56.760
 without any trace, without any imprint. We can do that. That is sign of the practitioners.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:07.960
 We cannot do that. That means our practice is not so strong. So strong. Even that happened.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:15.560
 Even we couldn't do it at that very beginning, but then again, the other state is not holding that.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:23.800
 Let it go. It's not just saturated in the mental state or in the brain. Kind of create a

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:32.280
 drop, conduct deep pressures. Kind of hanging over again and again. That is the samsara,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.160
 middle of the samsara, now we are. Middle of the we are creating calmness.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:44.120
 And that is really just completely kind of blended in samsara. They have,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:51.800
 again, through the strength of our meditation practice, reminder of our teaching, what teaching

00:21:51.800 --> 00:22:00.360
 we received, what we learned, apply that and try to let it go. Use the tools of all different

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.680
 things,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:08.520
 such as excuse, forgive. Excuse and forgive. I forgive, you forgive.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:18.040
 And excuse. Sorry to each other or whatever. Use those old tools which is, in samsara,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:24.440
 so powerful. It's famous. It's powerful too. Even though this is not named as a mantra,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.520
 it's in the way of mantra. It's powerful. When you will say, sorry, excuse, I didn't miss sex.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.840
 And forgive me. That, if you say it, it will light up that we all know.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:43.400
 Being as a practitioner, we should not be in stubbornness. Kind of maintaining on that,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:49.720
 these things and trying to insist it on our mistakes and ego-cling activities.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:56.120
 That is the habit patterns. Realizing, according to the correct teacher,

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:03.800
 Buddha Yatyamala's teaching point of view, we are banging our own head, banging on our head

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:11.240
 and creating more calmness. Legged calmness is not good calmness. Legged calmness, we are creating.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:23.880
 So therefore, here, this is what teaching says here. And the rituals. Not be mistaken

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:32.680
 about resolve the rituals and un-virtues. And then same way, virtues is, is, and positives.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:39.560
 That is again what I spoke in, or what I said, I'm not just, I'm saying that, but in the teaching,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:48.280
 teaching and morality, gathering all the virtues. That is what it is. Kind of understanding,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:56.280
 knowledge, the benefit, the power of the virtues. Activating that. Activating our simple,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:04.520
 positive mind, or good heart of compassion, loving kindness. Dharma is not something that

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:11.560
 have to be fancy and esoteric, difficult to understand, or have to be, no, I don't understand

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:19.240
 this much. It's simple. What great Master Papa Rumi said, Dharma is so simple. It's good heart.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:27.000
 It's love. It's compassion. It's wisdom. Everybody knows that. Even the animals

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:34.600
 knows the value and the importance of love and the completeness. With that,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:43.160
 kind of settling quality of that we ever can have in our heart, in the mind, or your brain,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:52.680
 and reflecting that. That is virtues. That is positive. And we combine that with mindfulness,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:58.760
 then it becomes more practical, more power, more space. Mindfulness, generally, is also

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:06.680
 wisdom. It's wisdom. It's mind. So, it's really guiding our, those beautiful motivations with

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:14.520
 that mindfulness. So, it becomes more practical, more sensible, more powerful, more effortful,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.960
 to benefit us, and to the other beings. That is the virtues. That is progress.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:28.840
 So, this is what you want. That in that way, again, as he said, now you understand. To show

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.240
 you understand how you can connect with that. That is really the post teachings of these moralities

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.240
.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.800
 Really, that avoiding all the negative abilities, gathering all the virtues.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:52.020
 Then, when we have good those things, all, such as we do a motivation, join, appreciate, both each

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.360
 other,

00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:00.520
 then what we need, then this we needed, this one, the last line of this teaching. In particularly,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:09.320
 devotion to the root teachers. This is, devotion is so important. Now, let's say, for example,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:17.080
 the beautiful garden. Beautiful garden. Soil is prepared. The bodhicata soil, bodhicata ground,

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.880
 love and compassion. You planted really seed of the benefit of all the living beings, or we planted

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:29.960
 seed of the benefit for all living beings. Now, have to prefer, have to, you have, you are watering

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:39.160
 all that. But the devotion is warmth of sunlight. We need sunlight. It will warm up. It will bring

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:46.440
 perfect growth, exactly what we needed. After every soil and every department, if sunlight

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:57.880
 add with that, then it blooms. That is known as blessings. Blessing. Blessing is like sunlight.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:06.280
 It will shine to those just bright to grow and develop that. With all the devotions,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:14.760
 according to the teaching, teaching in the buddhas, we cannot get at, or we cannot get perfect

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:23.400
 realizations. It's all kind of become most, kind of like dry. But warmth of the sunlight, of the

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:29.800
 blessings of your devotion, your motive, or what you invoke to your, by the devotion, it really

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:38.840
 makes completely perfect, beautiful growth, bring the development. So therefore, this is so

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:46.040
 devotional, so important. And this also not just, not just that devotion is the only one important,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:53.560
 this is his, his only, also he clearly say, is the one of the treasure of the practices.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:03.400
 Treasures. The wealth, treasure, wealth of the practitioners. Those practitioners who are seeking

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:10.040
 to reach enlightenment, or reaching to get some higher realization, achievement, not just only

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.800
 intellectual levels, but something, the heart level, that comes something that we can rely,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:25.000
 we can trust. Now, in the future, or when we're divided in this world, we can trust. So this, this

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.360
 treasure, the wealth we need, and we don't have this wealth, what will happen? Then we become

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:43.800
 power, power it is, poor, pathetic. Then it kind of dries up. We lost our resources, sources.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:51.000
 So therefore, this is the one of the first important wealth of the practitioners.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.080
 Then second, when we gather the virtues, virtues of the morality, what, what here,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:07.160
 his own dominion, said. The next page, love and affection to put Samaya, brother and sister.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:14.440
 This is second wealth, second treasures of the practitioners.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:23.080
 That means, is love and affection. Respect and appreciation.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:31.080
 Respect and appreciation generally for all the things. And I want, again, in the book,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:40.280
 here I want, again, in the teaching set. And the set, love and affection for Samaya, brothers and

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:48.120
 sisters. Samaya is, of course, teachings of the Vedya, Vedyan teaching, terminology. Samayas, we

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:57.560
 bonded with one Samayas. That means, we bonded one Samaya in one mandala over one circle, one

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.040
 circle.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:06.680
 Circle of the mandala of the deities. Or in this case, we all bonded one circle, circle of the mand

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:06.920
ala

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:13.240
 of the Gurdapriya Masambhava in the Bodhacharya Munis. We are circled. Within that frame,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:23.720
 in that one circle, we bonded. So that is known as the bounded Samayas. Then, in the Generated

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.120
 Buddha teaching or the Guhindar Bhatantra, particularly in the teaching set, there is

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:34.280
 five principal Samayas. Generally, all the Samayas are similar. Those are Samayas, we discussed

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:42.200
 earlier. Those are the Generated Samayas. So the five Dhanana Buddhas and as well as Samayas of the

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:51.640
 18th or 14th Donpols, and big ones that we joined when we do the Stellest or 10th Day in the Dakini

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:58.520
 Phuyang. Phuyang, those we joined, those are all Samayas. But then, the Gurdapriya teaching also

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.360
 made them slightly different. Actually, it's the same, same, slightly different. And those are in

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.520
 it,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:16.840
 I just have listed those. Phuyang, first one is always honor the Supreme Ones. Second is respect

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:28.440
 the teachers. And then, third one is never stopping the Mantra and the Mudras. Mudras.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:40.680
 And fourth is love for all the beings, particularly those who are in the Path. Path. Path. Fifth

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.880
 one is

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:52.520
 cigarette never revert. Cigarette never revert. Those are the five principal Samayas of this.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:32:02.760
 First, those five, the Path, first our breathing talk, that first one is never give up the Supreme

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:10.280
 Ones. What are the Supreme Ones? Supreme Ones, realization of the true nature of the inner

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.560
 thunder or very inner teaching as we're talking of the three Vedas. All the village truth is

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:25.240
 enlightened states and male and female Buddhas. At the absolute level, everything is in great

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:33.240
 emptiness. That is also these two are never separate from each other in a great union state.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:42.600
 So therefore, me, keep the view of the Vedayana. That is first important. Keep the view, keep the

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:50.920
 realization of that. Second one, really respect the teachers. There is generally many different

00:32:50.920 --> 00:33:00.360
 teachers. But again, if you can summarize the teacher according to any other teaching,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:08.360
 the teacher one will give the empowerment, instruction with instruction or the explanation.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:18.040
 And those are known as then road teachers. All other day, I mentioned also in the Goya

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:25.560
 Garbata, making qualification of the teachers at different, at qualifications. I mentioned

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:33.080
 other days. And those are again, the triggers, keeping the three triggers. One will keep the

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:40.520
 three triggers, meaning the will, meditation and Samayas. I want to teach you who is keeping.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:48.920
 At the same time, all the lineage teachings, empowerment are also whole. And also those are

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:57.320
 the four. And then third one, sorry, fifth one is one who is also very responsible. Responsible to

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.640
 keeping up the teaching and lineage teaching and honoring those exactly as should be, and also very

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:10.600
 thoughtful and helping to those who are kind of students or who are kind of SLA audience,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:19.320
 who's always taught. And then also have the sixth one is one who is also keep the instructions

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:27.080
 and the explanations of the Tantras. Tantras. And the seventh is one who has also knowledge

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:34.680
 and of the motherless and the medallist and ceremony systems also knows all that.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:42.920
 And at one is one who has some realizations. Realization in the heart or realization in the

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:51.400
 mind as the lineage teaching. So those are known as the qualification of the masters.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:58.520
 If those individuals have had that qualifications, they are the perfect teacher. I'm talking

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.240
 perfect.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:05.800
 They have the perfect of those, they have the perfect teachers. Perfect teachers. After all,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.560
 now all, then again, of course, the ordinary teachers, maybe not necessarily all of those,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:18.360
 but love and compassion, honesty and keeping the practice up and the best capabilities and what

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.440
 they're talking, talking also keeping that practice themselves as they practice. Those are the

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:31.320
 generally like the sign or qualification of the teacher is. So that kind of a teacher, teacher

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:39.000
 then always on respect. And the teacher is so important. I've got the greatest teacher,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.440
 the teaching, you should have always a teacher until you read in like that. Teacher always need

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:55.800
 it. Teacher need a teacher and the student need teaching and the student become teacher and they

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:03.640
 can also become the teacher and teach to others. This is the chain of lineage of the teachings

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:10.360
 or the disciples, continually caring, like or the torch of the wisdom and compassion

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:20.280
 that continually handed over from that 3,600 years ago until now on lineage and connected teaching.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.360
 And therefore, lineage is important. Lineage is not lineage of the kind of some different system,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.160
 custom of the way, how to, how to take advantage of others, these things or to gain the appropriate

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:40.040
 advantage. But this lineage is lineage of the kindness, compassion, egolessness,

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:49.560
 free from the self-deporter. That is true lineage. That continually carried all those very masters.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:56.360
 And the teacher often said, the chain of the golden mountains, stainless chain of the golden

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.360
 mountains. And when you look at those golden mountains of the chain, one golden mountain looks more

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.640
 glorified, more beautiful than others. And when you look at the others, also like that, one after

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:15.320
 another. Everyone each is a unique person, those great masters, really. Feel the love, compassion,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:22.200
 kindness. The heart is filled with that. The realization is that is what they are. They are

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:29.560
 indicated and all of that. And the same kind of honor the teaching as all of their life and their

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:37.400
 breathing or lives, lives and continually preserved and carried that. So this, that teacher,

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:47.800
 teacher is honored. That here, sit. Sit here. What's it? Yeah. So, oh, so is that is,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:55.000
 go hang up. I'm talking to you. And the next one is, then the mudras and the mantras. Never

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.400
 stop. That means accordingly your promised daily practices, weekly practices, monthly practices,

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:13.080
 while you're committed, trying to keep those up. Commitment is so important. According to Buddhism,

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:20.280
 with Buddhism, commitment is really important. If we miss the commitment, commitment, if we can't

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:27.960
 rely it 12 long commitment, then we could be losing. That adopted habit pattern in the teaching

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:35.560
 said it will have, it created habit patterns. And then it could reoccur one after another.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.800
 Then it becomes truly losing. Then soon we will blame to ourselves, blame to the other and blame

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:49.960
 to the other practices. Then we look lost. And then we brought all the samayas, the waas, all that.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:55.640
 We received all the beings of ascension, all the beings which once upon a minute tell the body to

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.400
 bow, oh, I'm going to help you all. I'm your service for all. Until I reach enlightenment,

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.920
 not just that, until you all reach enlightenment, I'm going to benefit the hell. I'm your service.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:12.520
 I'm going to put spread the Buddha over there. We say that clearly loaded with the clear mind

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:18.360
 and not pressured by someone or pushed by someone. Our own heart we say that. And now we're

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:26.200
 giving up that practice. Many times that happened, unfortunately, in the past, in ancient time or

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.280
 in

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:34.360
 Tibet, and now too. That is just really losing. Patience, breaking samayas, breaking rules, the

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:40.440
 waas, created such heavy calmness, according to Buddhism. Oh, have we believed in the law of

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:46.120
 karma and the cause and effect. But believe, whether we believe or not believe, doesn't matter.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:53.320
 It is the rule of guidance. For example, when we take the poison, whether we believe or not believe

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.320
,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:40:01.400
 believe in that poison, it will hurt us. Whether we know or not knowing, if we take the poison,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:10.520
 it will hurt. That is what it is. So therefore, that we should always keep our promise as much

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:17.660
 as we can. If somehow we miss those things, then do those very self-practice in your area of

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:17.880
 teaching.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:26.840
 So far, those with poor powers, practice is too old. Negative has no good qualities in the teaching

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:34.920
 set. I want good qualities, we can purify. Purify with mindfulness. Purify that with

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:44.840
 thoughtfulness. Purify with consciousness or alertness, with knowledge. We purify.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:51.320
 Then it's cleansed and purified. That's what great master Naludyana said in his letter to friends.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:41:00.200
 Once you've become the un-mindfulness and lost the attention or lost the attention,

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.920
 we do many mistakes. But once you've gained the mindfulness, alertness, cautiousness,

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:13.480
 then it will become clear and he looked at his teaching. He said, "Look to the life story of the

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:22.040
 Angulamalas, Angulamalas, and Adyachatas, the one who killed his own fathers." But when he knocked

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.120
 on

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:29.880
 the eyes and when he did the purification, they all got good results, good results, one opener.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:39.400
 These are just examples of that. So therefore, this and this. So therefore, again, I'm sorry,

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:47.320
 I'm kind of scared of that. And then in all of this, he said, "Next one is,"

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:56.040
 "Next one, in Goya Garba, the one with the point, I think I listed you,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:03.400
 and one is the point is appreciation and love to all the brothers and sisters."

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.120
 And that is what the young lady in the teaching said, more kind of commentary level. There is,

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:17.960
 I think, four different brothers and sisters. Gender, brother and sister, and then an inner

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:27.160
 brother and sisters, and then a close brother and sisters, very intimate brother and sisters.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:36.280
 What are those? The gender brother and sister is all the sentient beings. Everyone is our brother

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:42.280
 and sisters. As you remember, in the Buddha teaching, he said that all living beings are

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:50.040
 from our mothers or parents. Similarly, they also been our brothers and sisters. So all brothers,

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:59.480
 sisters. So it means the love and the compassion, and the body and compassion to all the

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:07.320
 brothers and sisters. So all sentient beings. Then inner brother and sisters, all the Buddhist

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:13.720
 practitioners. It doesn't matter whichever Buddhist schools we belong, and love and affections

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:22.760
 to all the brothers and sisters. Then a close brother and sisters is all the practitioners

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:29.080
 of the very understanding members. Everyone, all in one who follows the same path, that is

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:36.600
 close brother and sisters. Intimacy brother and sister is the one who within the one mandala,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:43.800
 received one initiation or empowerment, received the teaching, and big instructions, and during the

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:51.960
 all doing the Ganathaka ceremony together in one mandala. Those are known as intimacy brothers and

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:58.360
 sisters. Generally, these intimacy brothers, according to teaching brother and sisters,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.880
 is not just now, but we will be, according to teaching, we will be continuing until to reach

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:10.520
 enlightenment and go until, until we reach enlightenment, through love, the life after

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:18.280
 life, according to teaching. Therefore, it's so important to be respect, appreciation,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:26.520
 blindness, and kindness, and love and affections, all better than affections. So that is what is,

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:33.320
 if we do that, that is one of the trades. Second trades, second wealth of the practitioners,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:40.760
 as in teaching, the Jyapji union, etc. And the fourth, third one, here in the text,

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:48.520
 then it is, then this bodhic, the configurable, all mother-centered beings. Then we discuss it,

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:55.000
 I don't have to talk more, you all know, you all remember that. It's bodhic, for all the

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.680
 second beings. How? We did four bondless, we did four bondless, and for those doing practice,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:11.000
 equalizing, exchanging, others are more important than ourselves, those added really keeping in

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.680
 heart as much as we can. Here, that is one of the trades of the, the practitioners.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:28.280
 Then fourth one is, then it's all, it's component is our empowerment. Everything is

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:36.840
 empowerment. There's nothing is existing forever. It's all empowerment. Then we discuss a lot,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:42.360
 so I'm not going to talk now any more than that, but you know all that. These portrayals,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.320
 and we have these portrayals, these fifth trailers, including of the devotees, our dharma

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:58.840
 practices will stay, remain so strong, so beautiful, so fresh, it's not going to expire.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:07.320
 Many times our practices are almost going to expire. Expire, that is getting, date of expiring

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:14.360
 is getting close and close and almost kind of telling me why we are shortening, shortening of

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:23.800
 these trailers, this wealth. This is really, and so they ever keep that. And this also, for example

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:23.800
,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:31.080
 this fourth one, this imp, compass, what's called, and reduction, grasping due to knowledge that

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:31.480
 all

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:39.160
 component things are equal. All component things are equal. This is, of course, reduced the

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:48.280
 grasp. That is one, but also the time is short. Time is not going to stay forever,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:57.400
 waiting us. Well, there is a bus we have to catch. It's not, we're not, bus is not going to wait

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:57.800
 for us.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:05.880
 It believes in every time. Whenever we miss that bus, we miss it. Time is like that.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:14.200
 Time is a rollercoaster. It's moving. When time is moving, out time is moving,

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:22.840
 in time is clicking. Click is changing, one after another. Well, every opportunity,

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:31.480
 every circumstance, since our fail of the impermanence, that's the time we should take advantage.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:39.080
 If we do that, we will be the winner. Really, we will be the winner. We follow the footsteps

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:47.720
 of the correction teacher and all the other enlightenings. And that's how they all achieve

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:57.880
 their final realization. The dual that fulfilled all their wishes, and also dual that were

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:04.920
 fulfilling all the wishes or other sentiments without any discrimination. That is what it is.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:13.160
 So that's my teaching. And then, so this is my teaching. And then, of course,

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:23.800
 we continue the next time. But again, I think maybe just 12 days. And we're going to stop

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:31.800
 break for one, six days. I think one week. Until this following Sunday.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:38.280
 Sunday, we're going to, following Sunday is a Dakini day. And we're going to do Dakini puja.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:44.440
 I think that's exactly what we did before. And start at 2.30. And we do the Dakini puja

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:53.400
 of this kind of practices. So if you like to join that time, we join. And we all do Dakini puja

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:53.640
 that

00:48:53.640 --> 00:49:01.800
 day. And then after the Dakini puja, and again, around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I give again

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:13.640
 to all some of those. But we continue our teachings. So that is our announcement, right?

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:21.880
 Our announcement. And then plus, I just thought that what's called his name. Yeah, that's it.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:27.080
 And then also the same. That means we are all going to have short breaks. We're going to have

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:33.800
 little break, break of our retreat now. And also that means you will have little break for you.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:39.960
 This retreat for a short time. And of course, we should keep continuing our practice,

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:45.560
 personal daily practices, all that. That we should continue to keep. So that means, to me,

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:52.120
 also we will have the break. That means that I'm going to also have the break for six weeks.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:58.600
 And as well as Alhamdulillah and Alhamdulillah, they also will have break for one week, about

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:05.000
 six days. And after that, of course, we will announce the year two. But then we resume for

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.480
 maybe another five or six days. We see how things goes. And I hope everything really goes well.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:17.560
 Everything will completely change as spring comes. And so everything kind of more often,

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.920
 and everything really, we wish and pray. And all our practice, the meditation, we're dedicated

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:29.240
 for that reason. And for that purpose to everyone, every level. Okay. Thank you so much, everyone,

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.840
 for participating, again, for coming and thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now we do a short

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:47.560
 meditation. Again, let it know the time, but that's okay.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:09.240
