00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
 What's an other's truth? That's the Buddhism. In the Buddha's teaching, thinking of others is so

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.000
 important.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 In the teachings said, we're simply thinking of ourselves all the time, since the beginning of the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 times until now, we are thinking of ourselves, ourself, ourself, we, we, we.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.760
 For what we ended up, we know, nothing really we fulfilled, any much, and more difficult, more

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.000
 troubles, and struggling again and again, again and again, as climbing on the sand mountains.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Nothing really we further reached. That's what we're thinking of ourselves.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 On the other hand, Buddha, in the Great Bodhisattva, such as Medicine Buddha, taking over other

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.980
 beings, opening wide their mind and heart, thinking of other beings with love and kindness and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.000
 compassion, to all the beings.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.260
 And what they fulfilled? They've become fully enlightened, preformed all the suffering, the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.000
 difficult, miserable, unbalanced, what we don't like, what we don't want.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 They completely overcome that, not just that, they start to benefit to all the beings.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.810
 Wherever they go, wherever they read, even the names of them, bring them joy, bring the others joy

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.000
 and peace and happiness.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That is the what the performance they go, thinking of others.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.940
 That is the role model, the whole mark of the Buddhism, Buddha's teaching, thinking of others with

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.420
 love, kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, not just thinking of others with the I'm the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.000
 Great, I'm going to do something to you.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 That's not the way. But we respect and appreciate to the others and glorify them, their nature, and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.000
 that is the others, that thing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.680
 So therefore, we have to fulfill two goals also immediately, goals of others and goals of others

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000
 and ourselves.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 That goal is then purpose, immediate purpose to bring as what we're talking, the healing.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 Many people think healing is something connected with mind and it's something connected with maybe

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.000
 more healthy, same thing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.980
 But fundamentally, the cause of unbalance that I spoke yesterday to you all, and you maybe know

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.000
 many of those, is start to prolong our this monkey mind.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Our this monkey mind, unskilled mind, the inner mind is the source of every unbalanced state.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 That affected and the kind of ripple affect to the mind, body and then created all these things.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.060
 So therefore, we have to deal with it immediately with the mind and then as well as a target with

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.000
 this body.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.080
 Of course, body is the vehicle. Body is in the Buddha's teaching, often known as the boat to cross

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 the ocean of the samsara.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Cross of the old do good things to the body is so important.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 We have to cherish, we have to glorify, we have to honor and respect and keep balance as it needed.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Not too much, not too little. Too much is too much. That's what we call human state.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And too little is also not. Yes or right as the middle way.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 We have to cherish, we have to nice, we have to kind, we have to respect to this body.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.490
 To do this, then practice such medicine, but is so spectacular. It is good for our self immediately

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 to cure the disease and sicknesses.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And deep down it is glorifying our negativities and our karmas.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Our discourse of negativities of the ignorance and attachment and anger and so forth.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 This all this negative emotion are removing, pacifying that.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 So therefore, medicine Buddha is so spectacular.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And not just that. Then we are doing this for others.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Thinking of others as our primary object in the goal.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Goal and then walk to our son. That's what called dual purpose.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 To do this, to just come with that scope of the vision.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And goal and then we begin to practice such as this medicine Buddha practices.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.370
 Then, as in the teaching said, he is beautiful. This is, this teaching is wrote by or reworked by

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.000
 very famous master.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 As he said, he is studying the pedakarma chamma.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 He was a scholar, he was a master. He is a union of the scholar and master.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Not just an intellectual, not just only as a practitioner, but that's why he preferred his goal.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 He performed so many things, this pedakarma chamma.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.470
 He is one of the great masters, the great teachers in the Buddhist history or the Tibetan Buddhist

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.000
 history.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.780
 And this is a combined of the teaching of the Buddha dharma, the teaching of the guru and the sambh

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.000
ava,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.370
 and teaching of the great master Chanda Rakyat, with toghed, with dharma and kamma, and all united

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.000
 toghed.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And this is what called the sapphire water or the lakos, the lajuli water.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 That means, it is healing nattos. It heals the mind, it heals the body.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 But that means, we are, we have the, we have the skirt, skirt.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 We are wounded by the emotions, skirt. We are wounded by the emotions we have.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 We are wounded by the negativities of the ego clinkings.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 We are wounded by with all the grasping and clinkings.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And we are overloaded there. And this is great, cool, healing, natural.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Water that will heal that wound of the negative emotions.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.420
 And that will immediately affect to the, our body, which is also efforts on balancing and sickness,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.000
 ours and others.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 So therefore, this is so spiritual. This is blessed practitioners.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Blessed by the minds of the Murpaya Masambhala and Buddha and all those great masters.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And it toghed with his blessings.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And then he was also accompanied by very great thetum, known as namtyum mayadod.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Actually, he always, Rana as himself said, namtyum mayadod is the king of the thetum.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 He himself as minister, the management of this great thetum.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 He said, but himself is great.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 So combined toghed, this is so special practices.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And again, this is natural. This is healing water.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 And therefore, we are going to honor and glorify, cherish and keep very dear to our practices.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 This is a special practice that will do all this work as he said.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.010
 And the same time, this will then remove our obscurations, negativities and bring the enlightenment

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.000
 as this Buddha's enlightenment.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.560
 So therefore, this is very special with this beautiful honor and a gratitude and a graceful and a

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.000
 great honor.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.180
 And then we practices. And when we practice this, this as for the for this purpose to heal to

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.000
 ourselves immediately

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 and a long time to bring everyone to the enlightenment to this goal.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And this is as he said, in the teaching said, so those who are as a needle, if they like to do this

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
, continue as principal practices.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Practice it and then set up small, beautiful shrines.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 It's beautiful. This shrines are very important.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 It is a reminder of our practice in meditation instead.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 So set up beautiful, nice, comfortable, kind of very lovely, like cherish, like share, try.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 In front of that, then you sit down and begin to practice this.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 This practice itself is divided. Then always, every practice is divided into three sections.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Those are the great master and as well as many others said, three supreme ones, three noble ones.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 These three noble ones are so important.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 We like to practice what we practice. I like to be as part of the practice.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 There's something benefit to ourselves and benefit to the others.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Not just an immediate, but long-lasting benefit.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Long-lasting benefit to ourselves, to benefit to the other beings.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 This frame of these three principles, three supreme ones or three noble ones is so important.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 In the Tibetan, it's called tambasam, three noble ones.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Tambasam is so important, personal noble, middle noble and ending noble.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 We have these three noble ones, the whole practice, not just your practice.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Actually, all activities really become something very divine, something so special, so beautiful.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.130
 So therefore, it's good for all the older practitioners to remember this and also for the engaging

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.000
 newly practitioners to remember that.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 That makes perfect practices, perfect spiritual.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.440
 It starts with a good heart, with the body jata, with joy and devotion, and non-grasping, clean in

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.000
 ways.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.200
 And then, to continue carry that and fly that way, and we're going to landing and ending that

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.000
 practice with that beautiful holy and supreme one.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And then, continue the ripple effects all the time until we reach the enlightenment.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.670
 Until sentient beings are become the Buddha, it's said in the teaching, it will really affect, it

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.000
 will help them, it will benefit.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 So therefore, this is suspect.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And the first noble one is according to this sadhana.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Have you looked at this text?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And then, the first noble one is, of course, also I'm going to say again more with this text.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And the noble one is to start with the lineage prayers as we have this green booklet.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Lineage prayers.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Lineage prayer, and with all that, that means what?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 This teaching is not just overly developed here, overnight developed here.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 It is long-lasting continuation, lineage of wisdom and compassion, joy and appreciation.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 That continuing, this light continuing there, and we are connected to that light.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And therefore, we have to honor, we have to respect, we have to appreciate.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And we have to be taught, deep down, we need joy.
