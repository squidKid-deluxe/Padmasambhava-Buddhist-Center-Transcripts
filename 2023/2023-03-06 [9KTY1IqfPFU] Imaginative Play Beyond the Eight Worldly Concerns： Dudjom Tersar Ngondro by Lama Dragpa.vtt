00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640
 Welcome, friends. Welcome. Thank you, as always. Thank you so much, really. It really is such

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.080
 a special opportunity for us to get together, study, contemplate, and meditate on practice

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.380
 and embody the Buddha Dharma. Such a sacred, special, very rare opportunity. So thanks for

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 joining in, connecting in, turning that bright, shining wisdom, rainbow compassion, light energy,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.180
 turning it on within yourself to really connect with all beings in an uplifting, mutually

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.360
 beneficial

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.880
 way. So thank you so much. As we usually do, we'll have these three motivations, three

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.920
 ways to kind of refresh in that kind of naturalness in ourselves. We're going to like turn our

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.560
 minds toward the Dharma, and those three ways are renunciation, bodhichitta, and pure perception.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.120
 So renunciation, this joy and appreciation, this deep gratitude, so these 18 endowments

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.360
 we have. And so we can just really take a deep breath, feel our body, look around, look at

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.200
 all the beautiful things that we get to enjoy with these sense doors, sense organs that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 are working well, and then the sounds happen, and the colors happen, and the smells happen,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 and we're here. We have this life. We have these moments where we can generate virtue.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.560
 That's such a rare special opportunity. And so, wow, it's really kind of extraordinary.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.520
 And so let's do that together now. We'll generate a very virtuous state of mind, this bodhichitta,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 awakened heart mind of enlightenment. Just shine that on, that naturalness, that this

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.200
 very moment, this time together, we're really genuinely wishing, like aspiring, that this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.640
 becomes a root condition that's just perfectly aligned with all beings everywhere, ourselves

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 included. And it becomes just this, in every way, lovely situation for beings that can't

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 even help but have love and compassion and wisdom blossom in their hearts and mind. Like

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.210
 made this time, this time together, this reflection and this practice, may this become that

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.880
 condition

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.040
 for all beings to just wake up to their own inherent goodness.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.840
 And then thirdly, there is this inherent goodness. We have it, each of us. We've always had it.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.200
 We'll always have it, even if we don't see it, and we get kind of lost in the maze of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.560
 all of our kind of preoccupations and worries and doubts and fears and obsessions and all

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 the things. We still have this goodness. It's a stainless, continuous, true nature, this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.840
 Buddha nature that we have, tatagatagarbha. And so we kind of just confidently, courageously

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.000
 like kind of shine that on and be enlightened awareness, be our naturalness. So with these

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.200
 three qualities of exceptional boundless gratitude and joy, this love and appreciation for all

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.680
 beings with a confident responsibility to free them from suffering and the causes of

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 suffering, as well as seeing their goodness nature, there's no real reason to have to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.060
 free anyone from anything. It's all already pure and enlightened and awakened. So we bring

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:37.940
 all these three together as an active living experience right now.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.560
 Cool. So here we have these lineage teachings. We're connecting directly to the teachings

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.760
 of the Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava and this stainless mountain range of lineage masters

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.080
 all the way to our present living teachers. There's so many great realized beings around

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.240
 and they've given us instructions on how to wake up and fully embody this Buddha nature,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.040
 to like be an ongoing bodhicitta all the time. They've given us this guidance, these instructions.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.540
 We have that available right now. And that's all that we're going to be reflecting on now

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.720
 is this kind of living lineage of instructions of kind of advice that they've given. And

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.920
 so specifically, the topic for this brief time together is, it's called something like

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.400
 imaginative play beyond the eight worldly concerns. So imaginative play beyond the eight

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.040
 worldly concerns. So that's this brief kind of theme we have for today or right now. And

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.000
 it's kind of somewhat a free form, but it's also free form within these lineage frameworks.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.720
 So we have like all these lineage teachings and there's just a very tiny sampling here.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.680
 But the general idea that I was kind of thinking of is like kind of this natural capacity we

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.200
 have to imaginatively creatively kind of engage our experience, this imaginative capacity,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:13.240
 this creative impulse. It's what an amazing thing that each of us has. And at the same

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:25.440
 time in the Buddhist context, this functions best or this is most natural when it's not

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:35.360
 self obsessed, when it's not held within kind of a framework of look at my art, look at

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:44.520
 my offering. Basically look at me or you know, in one way you could say more like psychologically

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.120
 like love me. Here's this awesome thing. Isn't it awesome? Won't you love me? I mean, isn't

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.120
 that kind of we're always looking for this acknowledgement that I'm here too. I'm really

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:06.200
 so great, right? So that's kind of like the little bit of the game we've been playing

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.920
 kind of that we're kind of like automatically like making everyone play our game all the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.880
 time. And so the question is, can, how do we play this? How do we kind of engage this

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.520
 creative impulse we have this extraordinary capacity to really vibrantly engage in an

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.080
 elegant graceful spontaneous way? How do we do that in a Dharma way in a way where it's

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.120
 not all about me. It's actually about all of us and it's about all beings and it's about

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.520
 all manifest and unmanifest reality. So what is that in a Dharma context? How can we be

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.320
 artistic but not self obsessed or not so self important or not so self centered or so egotistical

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:57.640
 or so kind of disproportionately emphasizing me and my art and my new novel thing? So how

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:06.200
 can we novelty creatively like engage? And is that possible to be natural and creative

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.800
 and spontaneous and have it not be a self centered thing? Because my understanding of

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:23.200
 Buddhism which is very tiny is that that's what Tantra is all about. Talk about imaginative

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:31.960
 creative display where it's not centered on me at all. And so what we'll do here is kind

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.760
 of in some ways unpack like how that's actually what visualization and dissolution stage practices

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:47.200
 are. That's what we're doing. We're creatively emanating this entire universe of spontaneous

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:55.600
 artistic kind of unfolding dynamic display and then we're dissolving it like it's allowing

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:07.520
 it to self dissolve every time. So I think that's actually what in Buddhism Tantra Mahayana

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:15.120
 is all about. And so we'll kind of build this up and try to get that and see if that's actually

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.440
 true. So we'll kind of explore this a little bit. And so in terms of the title imaginative

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:25.640
 play beyond the eight worldly concerns. So what are these eight worldly concerns? What

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.200
 is the eight worldly concerns? Going right to inborn realization. This is R. Mckimpo

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.880
 Samoan Dhonya Rinpoche's commentary on His Holiness D. R. Rinpoche's Mountain Retreat instructions.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:45.680
 On Realization. And in this book on page 36, Kimpo Samoan Rinpoche says, it's only as D.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.040
 R. Rinpoche counsels us to give up the eight worldly concerns. The eight worldly concerns

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:59.840
 can be divided into two groups. The four that we want and the four that we want to avoid.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:07.740
 The four that we want are gain, pleasure or happiness, fame or high status, praise or

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:19.240
 sweet words. And the four that we want to avoid are loss, pain and suffering, obscurity,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:27.760
 or notoriety, and then blame or harsh words. So these eight worldly concerns are also called

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.960
 the eight worldly dharmas or the eight practices of samsara. The great master Longchampa said

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.480
 that whoever is preoccupied by them is like a sick person in bed. No matter how often

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:49.720
 he or she changes position, it is impossible to find comfort. As long as our minds are

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.680
 captivated by thoughts and emotions, it's difficult not to engage in the eight worldly

00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.080
 concerns. We're trying to free our minds completely, but this takes time. So what should we do

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.350
 until then? We should strive for less attachment. One way to accomplish this is to see all

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.880
 phenomena

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:19.360
 as dreams, illusion, or magic. Another way is to remember impermanence. What we want

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.400
 is impermanent. What we want, what we get is impermanent and we ourselves are impermanent.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:32.520
 When death comes, everything we have and know, including our self identities, must be abandoned.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.300
 If we truly accept this, we will stop wanting so much and so intently. We will better value

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.400
 what we have and what we are. Our empathy will grow because we'll know that all beings

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.440
 are subject to impermanence and death, just as we are. Our self-importance will diminish

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.160
 because we realize that death can come at any time and we have no control over it. Overall,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.600
 our lives will be more peaceful and productive. In addition to contemplating impermanence

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.480
 and death, we should try to remember that even if we successfully navigate our way around

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.580
 the eight worldly concerns, if we have not attained any spiritual stability, we will not

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.760
 secure happiness. As Holiness writes date, worldly dharmas can be condensed into hope

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.200
 and fear, which means attachment and aversion. Hope and attachment refer to what we want.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.020
 Fear and aversion refer to what we do not want. What we want and do not want are manifestations

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:41.660
 of our minds. Our minds are infinite and pure. Whenever possible, we should tune into this.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.160
 So here, Rinpoche, Campbell, San Antonio, Rinpoche has laid out some very pithy advice on what

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.740
 the eight worldly concerns are, how to work with them or kind of actually kind of open

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.660
 our mind in a way that's not so oriented around these eight worldly concerns, and then why

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.840
 we should do that because our mind is actually pure and perfect already. So these eight worldly

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.800
 concerns are essentially hope and fear, and they all orient around a sense of me. In Buddhism,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:17.080
 it's called ego clinging or self grasping. Me, what do I want? What do I want to avoid?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.760
 And so here they are. We've heard them a million times. Gain, pleasure, fame, and praise. That's

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.440
 what we want. Well, we want to avoid loss, pain, obscurity, and blame. So basically,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:35.440
 we want to be the center of the universe that everyone recognizes is the most special feature

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.520
 of everything. I mean, really, it's kind of so to say it in a way is really kind of ridiculous.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.520
 But isn't that what we do? I mean, and to some degree, it's not bad. If I have this

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.680
 tea, then I what do I want? I want to have the tea. I want the taste and maybe the little

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:01.240
 kind of like spark of like waking up. And that's all if it's I mean, it doesn't have to be

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.840
 selfish. But if I'm doing it with a motivation of wanting to get something, I look at an

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:13.000
 object like tea, and my mind's like, I'm not quite there yet. What this tea will make me

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.440
 actually be better, brighter, happier, more awake. This is called conditioned existence.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.840
 Because if all of a sudden, the tea makes me choke, or I dropped the cup, and there's

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.880
 no tea, or there's any things that could happen with this so many things that it could lead

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.480
 to actual suffering, and at the very least, it wants to tease out, then I don't have the

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:40.500
 support to actually have my mind be happy. Because I'm depending on this external thing

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:47.280
 to have a sense of happiness, contentment. So basically, instead of recognizing the state

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:54.440
 of my mind, in a way where it's naturally self satisfied or content, I'm looking outside

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.480
 of my mind, and relying on things around to make me happy. And then a lot of stuff out

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.380
 there doesn't make me happy, it actually makes me unhappy. And so I try to avoid it. So anytime

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.760
 we're in this kind of a framework, it's called the eight worldly concerns.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.040
 So Buddhism's hardcore. We're trying to come out of orienting around that, where I'm trying

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.740
 to have the world make me happy, and I'm trying to avoid the parts of the world that make

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:30.480
 me not happy. Right? So that's basically operating in a kind of a way of holding my mind in the

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:37.080
 eight worldly concerns. So it comes down to hope and fear. And to finally come out of

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.580
 hope and fear, how do we do that? All these teachings talk about look at how things are.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.600
 Look really closely at how things work. How do things outside work? How does the mind

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:55.640
 work? If we really look closely with logic, with our own intelligence, and are really

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:03.620
 thorough way and keep that investigation open, we'll actually have a more accurate experience

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.980
 of what's happening. We'll be more attuned to cause, condition, and effect. That's why

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:16.620
 they say this in some ways is just a scientific analysis, Buddhism. But it actually is a scientific

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.560
 analysis also of the mind. So it's this meditation. And if we map that mind, it can be considered

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.060
 a philosophy. And if we apply that in our daily life, it can be considered a way of life,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:34.680
 a transformative practice, a path. So how do we do that analysis to come out of these

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.860
 eight worldly concerns, which are pervasive? Anytime if you ever think I'm out of the eight

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:46.780
 worldly concerns, well, first off, you thought that, so you're not. Because that thought

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:54.100
 is actually indicating grasping. They say Buddhas don't think. So if we have a think,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.680
 if we have a thought, and we reaffirm the thought, then we're a sentient being. So that's

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.140
 a good check right off the bat. We're not out of the eight worldly concerns just yet.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:11.260
 So in this progressive stages of meditation on emptiness by Kenpo Sultrum Jamsa Rinpoche,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.540
 he's talking about this analysis. How do we look closely? So we come out of the eight

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.980
 worldly concerns. So we can recognize how our mind is already pure and perfect, right?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.780
 And that's the basic basis of Tantra, of doing a nundra practice. This is kind of what we're

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:33.660
 assuming we're doing when we do a nundra practice. Taking this kind of view that the empty, clear

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:41.700
 nature of my mind is expressing itself as the mandala of the refuge tree, for example.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.580
 So Kenpo Sultrum Jamsa Rinpoche says, page 22 in this book, "At the end of our analysis,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.300
 we'll arrive at the conclusion that the self is simply a vague and convenient concept that

00:16:52.300 --> 00:17:00.080
 we project now here and now there onto a stream of experiences and is nothing in and of itself.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.180
 One may wish to maintain that sense of self, that it's the continuity of a stream of physical

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:12.940
 and mental events that constitute a personality, and that as such it does not have to have

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.980
 the characteristics of being a lasting single and independent entity. But this is simply

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:25.220
 a redefinition of the term self. It does not explain our emotional behavior at all. Buddhism

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.420
 is not telling anyone that he should believe that he has a self or that he does not have

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.640
 a self. It is saying that when one looks at the way one suffers and the way one thinks

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.300
 and responds emotionally to life, it is as if one believed that there were a self that

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:50.740
 was lasting, single, and independent. And yet on closer analysis, no such self can be isolated

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:59.220
 or found. In other words, the skandhas are empty of a self. This felt sense of me, even

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:08.100
 if I don't believe I'm a lasting, independent, permanent me, I still feel like I am. This

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.860
 is a deeper layer of habitual mind or orientation than propositional beliefs. This is like a

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:22.820
 way I fundamentally orient every single kind of moment of experience, this felt sense of

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:31.940
 me. Buddhism calls that self. So how do I come out of that? Because if as long as I have

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:45.300
 that felt sense of me, then it operates with the eight worldly concerns, hope and fear.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.340
 This is in one way like a little bit of a talk for artists because like, oh, you know,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:56.420
 I'm expressing myself, right? Buddhism says good art is when you don't express yourself,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:03.220
 not from this fundamental fixated sense of me. Good art comes when we express ourselves

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:09.980
 not oriented in that way. And then it becomes actually wisdom art, wisdom expression, creative

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.580
 outreaching display of enlightened activity, which actually isn't just a nice piece of

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.460
 art. It's actually like an artful way of living that anyone who ever interacts with it is

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:28.180
 automatically uplifted towards a more easy situation for them to realize their own natural

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:34.820
 condition of mind, which is pure and perfect. So here in this book, advice from a spiritual

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.980
 friend, a commentary on Nagarjuna's letter to a friend, again, by Kempis and Don Armitje,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:46.020
 he talks on page 208 about egolessness. And he says with its understanding, let's take

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:53.940
 a deeper look at egolessness. The state of egolessness is the absolute meaning. On the

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.840
 relative level, we have the sense of I. And no matter whether it really exists or not,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.140
 our mundane experience involves clinging and holding strongly to this notion of a self.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.940
 As a result, we end up doing many unwholesome things that did not benefit anyone. This happens

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:14.740
 because of grasping onto ego, attaching to the notion of a self. We're trying to get

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:20.900
 smarter about this. The teaching explains that there is no truly existent ego entity.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:27.780
 What is the ego? It is a conception, one of our many thoughts. We grasp hundreds of notions

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.580
 every day and the ego is one of them. Clinging and identifying with an ego distorts our reasoning

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.180
 and understanding of what is happening and what we're doing. Activities influenced by

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.940
 ego are often based on self-importance. This leads to numerous troubles and difficulties.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.900
 In reality, there's no ego, no self, no duality, and no grasping. Whether we look among the

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.500
 aggregates or apart from them, it gradually becomes clear that there is no self to be

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.580
 found anywhere at all. The teaching explains this clearly, and when you realize it for

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.580
 yourself and the state of direct perception, it is known as vipassana, or clear seeing,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:14.860
 because it is the truth. This is not imaginary, but the truth. Ooh, imaginative play, right?

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.340
 There's no solid core to anything, no permanent object in this samsaric world. Nothing exists

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.940
 in the way it usually appears, separate and differentiated. Appearances are like a hallucination.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:30.180
 In the same way, the ego is an illusion. To see this exactly as it is is known as supreme

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:37.060
 seeing. That is a great insight and the meaning of vipassana. If we're undiluted, phenomena

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:42.100
 appear exactly as they are. Things are neither ignored nor exaggerated, neither overstated

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:49.580
 nor understated, but just so. To keep up and deepen this meditation is the essential discipline.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:22:02.020
 Once you take up the practice, continue until full realization. I'm jumping around, but

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:07.700
 this is all on a thread, right, if you like. So uprooting ego clinging. We're trying to

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.900
 say, okay, if we're not operating around the eight worldly concerns, that means we have

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.060
 to recognize how we're holding onto a sense of me, a distorted perception of a fixated

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:23.300
 sense of self. And how do we undo that fixated sense of self? If we're going to allow for

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.100
 our creative natural impulse, the wisdom, compassionate, outreaching quality of mind,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:34.140
 if we're going to allow for it to display naturally, how do we do that? So that's where

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.020
 we're at. We're kind of locating this ego and then we're kind of going into a few instructions

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:45.340
 about how to actually dissolve that unrealistic fixation. So here in uprooting clinging, commentary

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.540
 on Mipham Rinpoche's wheel of analytic meditation by both Venerable Kempa Rinpoche's. Here it's

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:59.660
 on page 58. This is talking about these aggregates, form, feeling, perception, mental formation,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.220
 consciousness. They say all of phenomena, outer and inner, are one of these aggregates

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:10.060
 to their combination. Each aggregate appears like the reflection of the moon and water,

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.980
 a mirage or a banana tree. In each case, there's no essence, no solid existence. They're all

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:21.900
 based on impermanence. They exist in a momentary and changeable state. This investigation leads

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.900
 us to the conclusion, the world of experience is an illusion. And since this world is an

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:32.540
 illusion, there's no need to be attached. Attachment and clinging are foolish, unnecessary

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:37.420
 and unwise. If the world consists of nothing but the five aggregates and they have no more

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.760
 reality than a reflection of the moon and water or a mirage, then all attachment must

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.860
 also be based on illusion. Maintaining awareness of this is the practice of meditation.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.460
 The result of a thorough and focused investigation is the development of definitive understanding.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.980
 The perfect understanding we gain through the use of this mental analysis isn't something

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:07.340
 we need to believe in. This awareness is certainty wisdom. When we meditate in this way, use

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.180
 using this analytic meditation, old habitual patterns will continually activate clinging

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.700
 and attachment. But if we maintain the meditation, we'll clearly see that even birth and death

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:25.620
 are illusions. Birth and death are just habitual patterns. The continued application of this

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.900
 analytic meditation will eventually lead us to discover the transcendental wisdom rainbow

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.420
 body that is beyond habitual patterns. In the Zogchen teachings, there are many stories

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.660
 of how great masters developed such an elevated realization of the transparency of reality

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.240
 based on the realization of the empty illusory nature of everything. That they could even

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.400
 move through material objects. They could do this because they had actualized the true

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.260
 nature and thoroughly realized how apparent reality is constructed. The Tibetan phrase

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:02.160
 for relative truth of how things appear is kunzop dempa or samvritti satcha in Sanskrit.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.780
 The literal translation of this is the truth that is completely superficial, artificial,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:20.810
 or unreal. The truth that is completely superficial, artificial, or unreal. The process of

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.500
 investigating

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.900
 using this technique of analytic meditation is so important because it establishes a foundation

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.700
 upon which there can be proper development. Without it, even if it appears that we are

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.260
 progressing, there will be difficulty later. Any progress made without this foundation

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.500
 will eventually collapse. The definitive understanding or the view established by analytic

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.580
 meditation

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:52.940
 is to not be attached to any aspect of reality. Arriving at this state of awareness that is

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:58.980
 beyond attachment causes us to perceive everything as being in transit, moving, changing, and

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.740
 only manifesting on a temporary basis. From this point of view, it becomes clear that

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.620
 clinging and attachment inevitably bring suffering. It also becomes clear that when we no longer

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:15.540
 have attachment, anger will not develop in us. This is one of the principal understandings

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:25.260
 of Mahayana Buddhism. Renunciation doesn't mean being completely removed from the world.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.900
 It simply means being detached. The Buddha left his royal palace to go to the jungle

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:37.940
 and meditate. That is one form of renunciation. But the more profound meaning of renunciation

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:44.300
 is having non-attachment that avoids clinging to worldly activities. Having no attachments

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.820
 is a much deeper form of renunciation than simply separating ourselves from objects of

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:55.660
 attachment. The whole idea or focus of renunciation is to attain a clear understanding of the

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.980
 state of non-attachment. When we have no attachment to worldly activities, the ideal of ren

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.500
unciation

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:11.420
 is realized. Then we can find enjoyment in every experience. This is what imaginative

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:20.500
 play is in Buddhism. When we have no attachment to worldly activities, the ideal of renunciation

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:31.340
 is realized. Then we can find enjoyment in every experience. This is saying that samsara

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:38.780
 actually isn't a pit of vipers or a deer trapped in the woods that have a ring of fire surrounded

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:47.980
 on all sides where we're just waiting for the fire to come to us. It's actually perfect.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.740
 Samsara is a function of grasping onto a fixated sense of self that's not actually there. That's

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.100
 kind of what all these Sutra Mahayana teachings are kind of orienting us towards. How to actually

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.780
 dissolve this fixation. That just means how to have non-attachment with the experience

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:11.820
 we have, meaning how to not funnel our experience through a sense of ego with me. Then we can

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:18.520
 access that creative imaginative play of how experience happens when it's not funneled

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.860
 through a fixated sense of me. How is that? What's that experience like? That would be

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:34.140
 what I would call imaginative play beyond the eight worldly concerns. This book, I just

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.340
 kind of came across recently, it's not that new. Powerful transformation. The alchemy

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:45.060
 of the secret heart essence. This is a compilation of teachings. Padmasambhava, Chudralingpa,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.300
 Kabjit, Durga Kentsa Rinpoche, and Tukur Urjan Rinpoche and others. This is now we're going

00:28:50.300 --> 00:29:04.100
 into what's it like to not fixate through egoic meanness. In this page seven, the

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.500
 most considerable of all obstacles are the innermost ones, which involve fixating on

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.220
 perceiver and perceived. Basically this refers to our habit of dualistic experience, which

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.340
 is caused by a lack of stability in the original basic state of empty cognizance. When this

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.740
 empty cognizance is not stable in itself, its expression is to reach out and fixate

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:31.260
 on the five objects of experience, the five sense objects. They are the perceived. The

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:39.440
 perceiver is the mind that fixates upon them. Although this basic original state of self-existing

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.980
 wakefulness has no duality whatsoever, because we fixate on experiences as being something

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:51.580
 other, seemingly duality takes place. As it continues, this perpetuation of dualistic

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:58.700
 experience is exactly what characterizes the minds of all sentient beings. Perceived and

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:05.180
 perceiver. The minds of sentient beings are caught up and fixating on perceiver and perceived.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:13.700
 This is the very core of samsaric experience, and this is in itself our innermost obstacle.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:22.930
 Okay, so here we get into the Vajrayana component. So what's it like to not operate through perce

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:23.180
iver

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:30.060
 and perceived? This is kind of where we're kind of headed, and it's what the nundra practice

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:59.380
 actually assumes. I'm going to pause on this book. Great. So where this opens us up into

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:06.100
 is the three samadhis. So this is a teaching the Venerable Kemper Rinpoche's have taught

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:11.700
 on so many times. In this book of theirs, Essential Journey of Life and Death, Volume

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:18.260
 1, Indestructible Nature of Body, Speech, and Mind, they have a really wonderful explanation

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.260
 of the three samadhis. And it's also talked about by Togo Urjan Rinpoche in this book,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.620
 Powerful Transformation. And in so many of these books, the three samadhis. So this is

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.070
 actually how we orient every single visualization practice, so creation stage practice, or

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.940
 imagination

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:41.060
 stage practice. This is how we orient that in Tantra Mahayana, so in Vajrayana, our Tibetan

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:48.860
 Buddhism. So always they go through the three samadhis. So just to say them quickly, the

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:55.300
 first samadhi is the true nature samadhi. The second samadhi is the all arising or all

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:05.220
 illumination samadhi. And the third is the seed syllable samadhi, or the causal samadhi.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:12.700
 So to put this really simply, the first samadhi, or concentration, this way our mind is aware.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:19.060
 The first samadhi, the true nature samadhi, is having the mind know itself in a way that

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:26.500
 doesn't fixate on an egoic sense of me. It's just fresh and natural. So the true nature

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.340
 samadhi is recognizing the emptiness nature of mind. So this is what all these instructions

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:38.020
 said we need to do, to experience life with non-attachment, to see it as illusion, as

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:44.860
 a hallucination, as magic. It's impermanent. It's pointing out that we see the external

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:50.940
 world like that, and we look at the perceiver in that way too. It's just like an illusion,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:59.420
 magic show, hallucination, this ongoing experience of transitory, kind of like bubbling up, or

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:06.020
 like movement of mind. So true nature samadhi is seeing that flexible open quality of mind

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:12.300
 that's doing that. Buddhism typically calls that emptiness. That's the true nature samadhi.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:18.460
 So that's step one. As the beginning of any visualization practice, we're trying to have

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:25.340
 our mind rest in its nature, open, flexible, and allowing for the impermanent nature of

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.700
 everything, outer and inner, perceiver and perceived, to flexibly, impermanently display

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:38.100
 as they will. Then this goes into the second samadhi, naturally. It's just typically in

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:44.060
 Sutra Mahayana called compassion. Here it's called the all arising samadhi, or all illuminating,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.380
 or all illumination samadhi. This is when our mind is open and relaxed, it naturally

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:57.900
 has a cognizant quality. There's a knowing quality. There's an energetic quality. This

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:06.180
 aware awareness always happens. The mind is always open and aware. They're inseparable.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:12.800
 But here this specific samadhi is called compassion without focus, all arising. The natural way

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:19.240
 the mind is when it doesn't hold itself around a fixed sense of me and mine, is it's totally

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:27.300
 open without boundary or limit, and it naturally arises as knowing quality, as wisdom. This

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:35.620
 is referred to sometimes as clarity. So compassion without focus means it's compassion that it

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.980
 doesn't arise in response to something, so it's not conditioned compassion. It's a natural

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:50.300
 quality of compassionate intelligence or cognizance. It includes knowledge. It includes knowing.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:56.020
 This is called compassion without focus, or all arising samadhi. And so then when this

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:03.180
 knowing or this awareness crystallizes itself, it's called the seed syllable samadhi, or

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:11.160
 the causal samadhi. So here's when we get into a sense of causation or things interacting.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:17.260
 Because in seed syllable samadhi, this arises as a syllable. This, I'm talking about, is

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:26.100
 my mind. So it's just total open emptiness awareness naturally includes all experience

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:33.220
 with great like inclusivity or like cognizant kind of boundless cognizance knowing. And

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.740
 then that kind of in one way gathers itself into a more solid tangible form, which is

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:44.580
 still on the semi form, and it's called seed syllable. And it's this crystallized distill

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:51.180
 that Rinpoche's call it like a nuclear kind of like inner nucleus of awareness. And in

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:57.500
 Tibetan Buddhism, this is called lungsem, wind and mind or wisdom wind and mind. This

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.300
 is empty emptiness and compassion in union inseparably. And they say this is actually

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.060
 the indestructible nature of body, speech and mind, the subtitle of this book, essential

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:14.260
 journey of life and debt. Union of emptiness and compassion indivisibly arises in a very

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:20.180
 crystallized essential nuclear power form as a seed syllable. This is actually what's

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:25.140
 in the heart center of every yidam or deity when we're doing a visualization practice.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.980
 They say it's actually what's in our heart center right now. This union of wisdom wind

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:36.260
 and mind is always there. When we're alive, when we're dying, when we're dead, when we're

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.620
 after dead, when we become when we've realized in some new body, it's always a wisdom wind

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:48.820
 with awareness with mind. Always. That's what Tantra is pointing to. And it's called Tantra

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:57.620
 argue continuity, what's continuous wisdom wind, inseparably united with awareness, arigpa.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:04.340
 This is indestructible. It's always there, but it's empty. So it's not a thing. It's

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:14.240
 not a self. This is the basis that this is how imaginative display, this is the source

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:21.580
 of imaginative play in Tibetan Buddhism, all Tantra. So with Sutra Mahayana, we established

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:27.260
 the emptiness nature in Shen Tong or fourth turning, that we established the creative

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:34.180
 outreaching capacity of like brilliance called Buddha nature. These are inseparably joined

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.700
 wisdom and compassion or wisdom and skillful means or emptiness and clarity. This is called

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:46.980
 Tantra. Now we're in Yana for Yana for create, so Yana 456789. This is all inner Tantras.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:55.260
 So now we're talking about imaginative play beyond eight worldly concerns. Okay, so that's

00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:01.580
 kind of where we are here. And these three samadhi's are the distilled. This is the doorway

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:09.500
 into Tantra. This is the beginning of every Tantric practice, true nature, samadhi, emptiness,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:17.100
 all arising samadhi boundless compassion, distills into a tangible form, a heart essence, seed

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:23.500
 syllable samadhi, which arises as cause and effect in the sense of things interacting.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.060
 Are they things interacting? No, because there are no entities. Everything's emptiness. This

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.500
 has already been established. We're in a state of mind that doesn't hold on to things as

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:39.780
 if they are our things, just rainbow display. But from the seed syllable, that then expands

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:46.940
 into a deity of being with a shape and form and it has a hand objects and colors and ornaments

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.220
 and then retinue doing dazzling displays. This is called imaginative play beyond the

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.740
 eight worldly concerns. This is what Tantra is pointing towards in the Buddhist sense.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:05.700
 Function of emptiness and compassion. So is it possible to be an artist and an artist

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:11.820
 with no sense of me? Buddhism says this is the only way to be a true artist. Everything

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.540
 else is just an ego trip. Everything else is just a show. It's just eight worldly concerns.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:26.260
 Look at me. Praise. I'm just trying to get what I want. I'm hoping to get what I want.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.980
 I'm fearing to get what I don't want. This is just samsara. It's just another way to

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:37.500
 do samsara of the infinite ways to do samsara. We can do it as an artist, a booker, a baker,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.780
 a candlestick maker. It doesn't matter. It's just about me. It's just an endless me game

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:49.660
 that leads to endless suffering. The way out in a Tantra approach is to use something like

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.680
 a technique of these three samadhis and then we have the creative, we have the capacity

00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.580
 to have this really dazzling burst of all powerful wisdom display that's totally outreaching

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.940
 with compassionate energy to support and uplift every single being with fine-tuned nuance

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:13.860
 according to how do we co-create artistic moments of mind together. This is called Tantra in

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.920
 Tibetan Buddhism and it always goes through a sadhana practice. There's always this lineage

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:23.900
 structure that because I'm a little baby, I can't use high-powered Tantra techniques

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.620
 as if I know how to use them. I'm just like learning basics, really basics, but these

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:35.620
 basics are just so powerful like the three samadhis. They'll do everything. They'll bring

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.900
 up all these habitual ways that I've been grasping onto a sense of me and all these

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.820
 games I've been playing that have led me to so much suffering and caused so much trouble

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.380
 for other beings. They'll reveal these habits and then if I use this imaginative play within

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:53.760
 a sadhana context and then use my body, speech, and mind, these ritual kind of enhancements,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:00.100
 I can release giant iceberg chunks of all these distorted perception and mistaken ideas

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:09.180
 and very quickly and finally be like a really true artist where like everything is like

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:15.700
 artistic display that boosts everyone, not just all about me, all about all of us. And

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:23.040
 that's where Tantra is like a living system of skillful means art. And so we've jumped

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.740
 around and there's certain things I kind of wanted to say. So these three samadhis, these

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.100
 are things we really need to know because they're actually what we're trying to do with

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:37.220
 every nundra practice, every Tibetan Buddhist practice, these three samadhis. Emptiness arises

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.380
 as compassion without reaching unlimited kind of like tangible shape which is called seed

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.700
 syllable samadhi and then does these enlightened expressions. And then how does it communicate

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:53.700
 through light? In this context everything is seen as wisdom. So in the sutra context

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.180
 they say it's like a rainbow. In the tantra context they say everything is transcendental

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:09.260
 wisdom rainbow display. Sound is, speech is, speech sound is, form shape is, mind movement

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:16.100
 is all rainbow display, transcendental wisdom rainbow body, all of it. So this is an imaginative

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:22.100
 display not funneled through egoic mehood. And so we can talk about this, we can talk

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:27.300
 about these things as if these three qualities of mind, the Buddha taught was so kind, presented

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:32.220
 this in so many ways depending on what would help beings. We can talk about this as substance

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.620
 like seed syllable, sometimes like the ground of all being or Buddha nature. Like this nature

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.980
 is talked about as an object even though it's empty of being an entity. You can talk about

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:49.900
 this nature as if it's a quality. This is like wrong tongue, empty of self. It has the

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:57.740
 quality of being inherent as like empty of inherent existence, free of entityhood, free

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.860
 of identity, free of fixed characteristic, free of fixed destination, free of fixed source,

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:09.020
 free of fixed place of location of abiding. It's free of all these things, these are qualities

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:19.700
 it has. Emptiness. And then thirdly is talk about it as a state of mind. Union of compassion

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:26.540
 and emptiness, of skillful means and wisdom. This is called Rigpa, true nature of mind,

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:33.000
 naturalness, sometimes it's called wisdom or Rangjhanyesh, self-born wisdom awareness.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.340
 Unborn, unceasing by nature like the sky, experienced by self-reflexive awareness, discerning

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:43.500
 pristine cognition, discerning pristine cognition. Rangric, this is the wisdom awareness, the

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:51.000
 union of emptiness and clarity in self-born awareness. It always has this energetic display.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.580
 This is the union of emptiness and clarity. This is called Lungsam or wisdom awareness,

00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:01.060
 always riding a subtle wind. This is the indestructible nature of mind. And if we connect to this

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.300
 again

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:07.660
 and again in our practice, this is actually what will make us accelerate this whole path

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.940
 of being free of samsara, of the states of mind that make everything about me, that's

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.300
 eight worldly concerns that basically make everyone have to meet me on my terms all the

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:22.460
 time, where I use everyone just for my advantage. This is really the fundamental way to undo

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:30.180
 this really quickly, to do this three nature like the three samadhis, recognize emptiness

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:36.820
 and its clarity, knowing capacity in union as the display of all experience as the transcendent

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:42.340
 wisdom rainbow body. So when we visualize a refuge tree and under practice and ourselves

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.660
 and doing these mudras and making these offerings and doing this, we're trying to always maintain

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:53.140
 the state of transcendent wisdom rainbow body. That perceived is transcendent wisdom rainbow

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:58.460
 body. The perceiver is transcendent wisdom rainbow body. Transcendental meaning is emptiness.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:05.920
 Rainbow body meaning it's like it actually arises as like a display, as an empty appearance.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:14.980
 Play is in union, so it's emptiness and clarity in union. So then this becomes imaginative

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.580
 play and then the playfulness is actually we have to tune in and line up with where

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.180
 other beings are at and what's skillful to help encourage them to relax and like have

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:29.940
 their own creative flow come out. Then we can co-create, co-shape, co-play, do like have

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.660
 all that sort of kind of all these wisdom mandalas are all about and that becomes like

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:40.820
 the way of the bodhisattva. It's kind of what all this is really talking about. So here

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.540
 back to this book and then I'll conclude this powerful transformations. Read again from

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:56.960
 Togor Urjan Rinpoche about these three samadhis. Sadhana is not something we make up. There's

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.580
 actually no real difference between our Buddha nature and the state of Dharmakaya of all

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.500
 the Buddhas. So rather than this practice being a way of creating an imagination of

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.660
 the state of a Buddha, we don't have to create anything. We should allow our nature to be

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.660
 what it actually is, which is no different from that of all the Buddhas. Just read the

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:23.380
 sadhana's lines while leaving the mind in its natural state and the three samadhis naturally

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:30.140
 occur. Just read the sadhana's lines while leaving the mind in its natural state and

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:37.780
 the three samadhis naturally occur. And then back here, page 13, the importance of this

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:44.780
 yidam practice or this visualization stage practice in Tantra Mahayana. Yidam practice

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:50.060
 has great benefit. Mipham Rinpoche had a vision of Manjushri, his supreme deity, and through

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.020
 that he became a great pandita, an extremely learned scholar. Many of the Indian mahasiddhas

00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:00.340
 practiced Tara sadhana. They combined recognizing mind essence with a yidam practice and attained

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:06.340
 accomplishment. All the life stories of those who became great masters tell of yidam practice.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.500
 You never hear of anyone saying, "I achieved accomplishment and didn't use any deity."

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:18.580
 I didn't need to say any mantra. The yidam practice is like adding oil to the fire of

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:27.760
 practice. It blazes up even higher and hotter. Visualization stage practice is critically

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:39.260
 important in Tibetan Buddhists as a skillful means to awaken our wisdom awareness. And

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:45.180
 then last here, this is like simple way to kind of go about this. Page eight, if you

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.980
 train in just one deity, like Vajrakalaya, practicing at first within the structure of

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:57.380
 the three samadhis, and then while recognizing mind essence, I can guarantee that within

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:03.120
 this one lifetime, you can accomplish both the common and supreme cities, the supreme

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:10.500
 city of complete enlightenment. And here he makes it even simpler. Page nine, practice

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:20.060
 in a simple way like this. First, remind yourself of being the deity, thinking, for example,

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:29.780
 I am Vajrakalaya. Then recite the mantra of Vajrakalaya or whatever mantra you're doing.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.180
 Or simply say, "Omahung," this whatever mantra you're doing. Next, recognizing that the one

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:42.420
 who has, sorry, next, recognizing that the one who imagines the deity, enchants the mantra

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:51.460
 is none other than your own mind. That's it. Have conviction that I am the deity. And while

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:57.100
 you sustain that conviction, the certainty wisdom, recite the mantra of that deity. And

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:02.180
 then while you recite the mantra of the deity, with certainty wisdom that you are the deity,

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:08.580
 realize that everything is your mind. This is called deity, mantra, and Dharmakaya. These

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:16.140
 are the three samadhis. Deity is the seed syllable samadhi. Then the outreaching expansive capacity

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:22.660
 of mind, that's actually called wisdom, speech, or mantra. And then the Dharmakaya, that's

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.980
 the true nature samadhi. So this is the union of the three caiyas. I am the deity, recite

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:36.390
 the mantra. This is all my mind. This is simply put, transcendental wisdom rainbow body, everything

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.540
.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.840
 So page nine, in this way, using the single thought, I am the deity, visualization takes

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.860
 no more than an instant. This instantaneous recollection, bringing the deity vividly to

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.700
 mind in an instant, is the highest and best form of visualization. With your voice chant

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:59.260
 the mantra and with your mind recognize. It is perfectly all right to decide that this

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:05.260
 type of practice is sufficient and all inclusive. It's not like we have to please the wisdom

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:11.180
 deity, which has no thoughts anyway. Wisdom deities don't get pleased or displeased. So

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:16.460
 it is really more a matter of making up your own mind and practicing in this simple all

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:23.180
 inclusive way. This is my opinion. Maybe I'm being too simple here. On the other hand, maybe

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:37.460
 it is true, it's all pure gold. So thank you, I thought to bring it to a simple point at

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.900
 the end. In the end, we can think, imagine it play and all this boundless beings and

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:49.220
 how do I kind of attune to them like naturally with actual like accuracy, then if we really

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:54.900
 in our own practice as we're as we're developing this capacity, have that vajra courage, I

00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:01.460
 am the deity. Recite the mantra as the natural expression of the nature, self resounding mantra,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:06.660
 and then recognize this is all mind, outside's mind, inside's mind, perceived as mind, perceivers

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:13.820
 mind, it's all mind, it's all the deity. And just let yourself be the deity. And this is

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:20.220
 the deity's mandala. And this is the mantra energy, the movement of the mandala. And just

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:24.980
 allow it to be there and at the conclusion of the sadhana, following exactly how to create

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:30.060
 the sadhana and how to dissolve the sadhana, exactly according to the lineage instructions,

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:36.860
 allow it to dissolve. And then these samadhis all dissolve back into the true nature of samadhi.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:41.780
 And then everything is revealed as like a beautiful artistic, imaginative display of

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.540
 creative transcendental wisdom rainbow body, and its emptiness and its outreaching clarity

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.300
 capacity and their natural union, wisdom and compassion inseparable. So that's kind of

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:57.380
 a brief talk today. And then we'll go on to the duejum terra sarnundra practice. So we'll

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:02.740
 begin here, this duejum terra sarnundra practice thing is page 17, with the spontaneous calling

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.820
 the Lama from afar by his Holiness duejum Rinpoche. So I hope this was helpful. If I'm

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:11.420
 saying anything wrong or doing something, any mistakes, I really apologize for them.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.360
 But really just I'm trying to repeat these words of these great masters and kind of also

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:21.140
 offer some resources that if you if any of this is curious for you, or you're like want

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:26.540
 to look further, then these resources are all available to us. And then in addition,

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.860
 we have these practices we can just do in a really simple distilled way, which Venerable

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:36.180
 Kimper Rinpoche is just like Raga Asi, just like Mipham Rinpoche, they can take this infinite

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:42.420
 complex, utterly profound and vast Buddha Dharma and distill it into these essential

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:48.780
 practiceable like very pithy instructions that we can really taste the benefit in our

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:55.060
 direct experience with very little time or effort. So here we have this great fortune,

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:59.420
 the duejum terra sarnundra is a perfect example of this, a term of revelation by his Holiness

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.540
 duejum Rinpoche. It's exactly like that. It includes all of the Buddha Dharma in a very

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:10.660
 simple, concise, easy to practice way. So we're utterly fortunate beings in this time.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.980
 And we need to really use that fortune, because not everyone has this fortune. And people

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:21.860
 need us. And we need to show up for them. And I need to show up for me too. This world's

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:28.300
 not getting any like more, you know, nice and kind and common sense and really intelligent.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:33.740
 It's kind of like this is getting really tangible time, a lot of tangible like warring tangible

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:38.660
 backlash against things. So many of these elements are getting so distorted, just like

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:43.900
 echo chambers of distorted, very tangible, gross level, kind of like five degenerate

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:51.620
 five qualities of degeneration age. This is a time before is worse. To really recognize

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:57.300
 that inherent goodness of oneself and others. We can take time set these times aside for

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:02.740
 ourselves and get more of a confidence in this. At the very least, even though we can't

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.060
 do some big outreaching thing, when our elements are dissolving and we're dying, we can recognize

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:14.380
 this nature with confidence and we can have this compassion to come out just like so easily

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:20.220
 and just love beings and just love like there's no really big difference between outer and

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:27.140
 inner perceiver and perceived can just be love, be compassion, wisdom, like be transcendental

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:33.340
 wisdom, rainbow body. This time's coming for us. This time is really coming. Tick tock,

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:39.380
 tick tock. I mean, I'm this gray is like getting grayer, you know, by the minute. When the

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:46.740
 time comes, like I want to try to have confidence in this. If we can if we can recognize the

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.940
 meaning of these teachings right now, it's a perfect opportunity that when we die and

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:57.820
 all these elements break up and it's just right in front of us, this nature of our mind

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:04.020
 will be full on vibrant display of sound, color, light, like all this and the deity is

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:12.700
 everything. It'll be brilliantly like just like immaculately like display. If we can

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.460
 relax and be like, this is I am deity. This is deity. Have compassion. This is just the

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:23.980
 arising movement of the nature. It's all my mind. We will go to Dehwa Chan. The Buddha

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.260
 is so strong on this. Lama Chime Rinpoche is so strong on this. Kemper Rinpoche is so

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:31.660
 strong on this. So this is really what we're practicing. We're not just like trying to

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:37.700
 be good Buddhists or something. We're trying to get free, recognize this is all perfect

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:43.220
 and pure and this is how to do it with these practices. And so that's kind of my like little

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:48.720
 kind of obsessive ranting kind of conviction that I'm just telling myself, Drakpa, get

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:54.620
 your shit together, Drakpa. It's easy to say this stuff, but we really actually have to

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.480
 get that conviction. Then if someone says a nice thing, it's a rainbow. If someone says

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:05.620
 a mean thing, rainbow. We get sick, rainbow. We win the lottery, rainbow, you know, like

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:12.460
 we become indestructible wisdom nature. Then anyone we engage with, we're just naturally

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.900
 going to love them in a skillful way. Then everyone, when they say the Buddha was a friend

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:26.060
 to everyone, we'll become that. We will truly be a friend to every single being forever.

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:30.820
 Then we'll really be fulfilling our bodhisattva vow. So really thank you so much. We'll go

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:37.020
 to this page 18. The prayer of calling Lama from afar by his home is Dehwa Rinpoche. Really

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:54.780
 thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Quick summary. It's good. It's a quick summary.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:59.340
 We covered a lot. So imagine it of play of the eight going, imagine it of play beyond

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:06.560
 the eight worldly concerns. This all basically comes down to fearlessness. How to fearlessly

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:16.360
 like creatively engage with experience in a way that really loves beings and really compassionately

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.220
 responds to them and works with them and encourages them. And that means encourages me and responds

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:27.900
 to me and works with me. Like, like fearlessness. That's really what this is coming down to.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:33.940
 It's like a key essential point of Tibetan Buddhism or Vajrayana path. That courage,

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:39.940
 I am the deity. This is good. This is pure. Everything is enlightened wisdom awareness.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.260
 And it's easy to say transcendental wisdom rainbow body. It's so easy to say that. But

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:50.120
 to recognize that now and an hour from now and a day from now and a week from now and

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:56.440
 when real challenges happen, that's really when we get to see for ourselves like how

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.340
 much we're really absorbed the teachings into our hearts. And so here is a quick Dzogchen

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:06.660
 deity practice. Meeting your true nature. So beautiful. There's another compilation

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:11.300
 of books. This took her urgent Rinpoche once again here. It says talking about after we

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:19.220
 die, right? Big challenging time, right? The sounds in the Bardo, so this is after we die,

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:24.660
 the sounds in the Bardo are not small noises. They roar like a hundred thousand simultaneous

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:31.620
 thunderclaps and the lights and colors shine with the brilliance of 100,000 suns. Later

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:36.920
 when the deities begin to appear the largest of the size of Mount Sumeru while the smallest

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:43.420
 are no bigger than a mustard seed. The deities are vibrantly alive and dance about faced

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:50.320
 with this spectacle. You have two options. Either you panic with fright or you recognize

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.580
 them as your natural displays. This is why it is incredibly beneficial to practice in

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:03.140
 this life. So you grow familiar with your own natural displays. Otherwise facing them

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:12.340
 in the Bardo will result in deep confusion and bewilderment. Fearlessness. So then Rinpoche

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.140
 is an essential journey of life and death. Again, they just emphasize this same point

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.900
 in a different way in the Vajrayana. This is 306 in the Vajrayana teachings. It often

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:26.920
 says that in order to do visualization practice, we need to have courage and fearlessness.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:33.020
 It's a big job to fully embrace this beautiful special view that has never arisen in our

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:39.660
 heart or mind before. This view will completely smash our ego. Therefore we need courage.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.420
 We need fearlessness. These are so important. If you have fearless courage together with

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:49.940
 skillful means and wisdom, you will conquer the world. In this case, we're conquering

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:54.620
 all of our habitual patterns and the negative emotions that are like hidden tigers such

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.460
 as anger, jealousy and hatred. They're very aggressive, hiding behind the scenes, showing

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:04.380
 up at any moment to attack us and others. To defeat and overcome these negative emotions,

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.940
 we need courage and fearlessness. That's why the Buddha is named Conqueror. The Buddha

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.700
 is not the kind of Conqueror who attacks, destroying cities and murdering people. The

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.800
 Buddha as well as all the Bodhisattvas in our hearts totally conquered negative emotions

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.400
 and habitual patterns. They're not creating more suffering. They create everlasting joy,

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.960
 peace and happiness for all beings. They're true conquerors, true warriors. Now we're

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.140
 following in their footsteps, sitting on their thrones. In order to embrace this view, we

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:42.180
 need courage, confidence and fearlessness. So this is imaginative play beyond the eight

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:49.220
 worldly concerns. This is like what it means to be an artist in the Tibetan Buddhist sense.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:56.100
 And this view is exceptionally specific. This is not just some easy transcendental wisdom

01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.440
 rainbow body. We just say that. We can get to the heart of it with the key essential

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.740
 points like Turkar Arjuna, which I said, and the deity recite the mantra, recognize this

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:11.500
 is all display of my mind. This is interesting. I really wanted to mention this today, which

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:17.220
 is unusual and interesting. In this book, entering the way of the great vehicle, Zogchen as the

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:24.380
 culmination of the Mahayana. This is by Rongzompa Chukizongpo. This is the great Rongzompa. This

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:30.370
 is one of the two pillars, one of the two omniscient ones in the Nyingma school of Buddhism, Longch

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:30.620
ampa

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.740
 and Rongzompa. This book, when this became translated, Kempo Saewandani Rinpoche said,

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:42.420
 "Please get that and sell that in the Chisodarma store." Entering the way of the great vehicle.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:51.180
 This is one of the few texts by Rongzompa that survived. Rongzompa. So that's that. This is

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:59.380
 about how this fearlessness is not just some wishy washy fearlessness. Page 108, Rongzompa.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:06.180
 This is the great perfection as intimate advice. How is an object resolved through intimate

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:13.300
 advice? When resolved decisively, the significance of the object is recognized in connection with

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:23.260
 several points. All phenomena are resolved to be empty and selfless. Without inherent

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:37.580
 nature, absent of production, qualitatively the same, and nondual. On occasion, the meaning

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.700
 of these terms may overlap and at times they indicate that there are verbal points made

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:46.220
 precisely in accord with the terms that are used to express them. So this is a really

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.900
 technical book. This is talking about the Zogchen view, what Zogchen means by transcendental

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:58.060
 wisdom rainbow body. Resolved to be empty and selfless without inherent nature, absent of

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:04.300
 production, qualitatively the same, and nondual. This is like a road map of all the philosophical

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:10.620
 teachings of the Buddha right there in that one line. This is exceptionally specific. This

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.980
 is how we get to transcendental wisdom rainbow body. Shravaka view resolves that everything's

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:23.820
 empty and selfless, but they still think there's inherent nature of objects. Mind only school

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:30.980
 sees that everything is selfless and empty and that all phenomena, the two emptinesses,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.700
 all phenomena outside and inside, perceiver and perceived, are empty of inherent nature,

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.740
 but they still posit causation. They call it dependent origination, dependent arising.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:49.140
 That's a second nature in mind only school. Then Sutra Mahayana and Madhyamaka, the middle

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:55.460
 way, they refute that there's no cause, there's no effect, there's no samsara, there's no

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.380
 nirvana. They refute. They say it's absent of any production, no cause and effect on

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:09.820
 the absolute view, but they do assert there is a correct relative truth. Then comes Tantra.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:16.100
 Tantra refutes that there's a correct relative truth because they say it's all pure, not

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.980
 just one. There's not correct and incorrect anymore. They say it's all pure, but they

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:27.700
 still rely on certain techniques of ascetic practice in the outer Tantras to establish

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:35.420
 that purity. Then in Dzogchen, in the inner Tantras, they say it's all non-dual. They

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:44.100
 don't have any techniques they use. They call it a path of non-progression path, effortless.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.540
 In this way, the Dzogchen view, what they mean, transcendental wisdom rainbow body,

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:54.660
 is resolved to be empty and selfless, without inherent nature, absent of production, qualitatively

01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:01.740
 the same and non-dual. That's what we mean by Dzogchen, transcendental wisdom rainbow

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:07.100
 body, which is what we can achieve if we just do these three simple points. I am the deity,

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:12.780
 recite the mantra, recognizes all mind, display of mind, and then this, when the bardo comes

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:16.580
 or when really challenging times come, that fearlessness will be there. We'll have that

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:21.200
 courage through these very specific ways, put in really pithy, actionable statements

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.980
 that we can really use right now, then we'll actually achieve that accomplishment. In the

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.980
 next life, we'll become really courageous heroes for the benefit of every single being

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.180
 we ever come in contact with from that point on forever. I pray that this happens for all
