00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Well, during the speed of resolve, therefore it will boost up our realization, our understanding.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.390
 Every conduct that is shaking, realization and achievement will be delayed, even completely mixed

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.000
 up.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 So therefore, conduct is one of great support for our own practices.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Therefore, what is in it said, "Lat or rajoba," at the beginning we listed, "lat or rajoba,"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 the conduct that will bring the fruit visions, or it boosts up.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Conduct is like medical growth, if we use examples.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 If we like to grow quickly, faster, good conduct, that is what we need, conduct.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Now, this conduct, also, of course, we are talking about this again with teachings,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 but generally with our teaching, we talk about the scope of the conduct levels.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.450
 Generally with our teaching, respect and appreciation is all the traditions and the country where

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.000
 you are,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 respecting the rule of the laws, not bringing the dharma view and ignoring that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And we do this, that is called "mistakes," wrong, mixed up with ego-killingies.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Even though we are trying to remove the ego-killing, clearly with ego-killingies,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 but we are using the dharma as skip-god and ignoring the common consumption systems.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 That is not the practice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.270
 Therefore, Buddhas, for example, all the Vinaya rules, rules based on the tradition and who part

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.000
 the world is.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Not Buddha didn't board his realization business and everything is equal, you can't do anything.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Buddha made rules specifically, these and that things.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So therefore, what is generally Buddha's teaching, our conduct, we should, for example,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.650
 become very unpractical, we should keep, observe and respect all the rules and regulations of the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.000
 countries and traditions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 When we come to dharma things, dharma, we should respect and appreciate all the Vinaya's teachings.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Because we told those of us, with very unpractical, very unpractical contains all the teachings.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 So we respect and appreciate all the Vinayana teachings, Vinaya rules.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Then we respect and appreciate it with the bodhisattva teachings, Mahayana teachings,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 vows of the very bodhisattvas and then vajayanas.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So we should, that is what the great master also, Gurdhva Masambha said in one of his teachings,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 said we should perform the activity exactly as Vinaya's teachings.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Follow that system, it will make our thoughtful and intro expression to all our subtle activities

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 so that we will not mix up our karma or our cause and conduct, mix up that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 We really become more wise, more smart, bring more common sense.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 We need more common sense, we are not going to jump in this and that, there are different ways.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Common sense, be on the ground, that's what we are.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Stay on the ground and follow the ground path and look to the sky.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 That's what the great master said.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Follow the conduct as Vinayas, Vinayas but keep the woo, woo as vast as species.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Bring the woo in the heart, perform the activity.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Externally you are performing everything so thoughtful, so beautiful, respectful,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 respect and advocating and politeness and very gentle and friendly, that's what we do.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But inwardly our realization is deep and strong and all integrated equanimities,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 not called the booziness of all the duality, consciousness.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 That's what the teaching said.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 So this is what really we should do.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Graduation means gradually we are developing.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Graduation we are developing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 At that time what is our head?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 First of all, is head and endeavor or the devotion in devils.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.160
 When we have the strong faith or the devotion and the joy of effort to maintain our practice in

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.000
 meditation.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Meditation, that is conduct.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Conduct is keeping the practice, helping the supporters of that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So we are not just ignored, lost and using different kind of like statement and our rule.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Things that make communist our savages.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 That is ego.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 This is the mistakes.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Therefore, thoughtfully moving forward.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Bring the realizations.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So this again we talk a little bit about this joy of devotion and joy of effort.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 What in the teaching said? What that means again?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 To elaborate this teaching, it means keep the Samayas.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Samayas solid as ground, ground, ground.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And then second body said, mature our mind with starting and contemplation.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Learn more, learn more, discovery.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Learning more is discovering our own natures.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.280
 Because teaching from the top to the bottom, for example this teaching from the one body one all

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.000
 the way to the end is teaching about our mind.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Every top, all is about our mind.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 How to improve, how to discovery, how to shut up, how to glorify, how to make benefit to myself.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 How to make benefit to all the beings.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Therefore, second, the devotion, the pain and endeavor or however it is oscillated.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That is, this is starting in a contemplation where mature and tame the mind.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Mind.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.540
 What do you say that? When sign of the good knowledge of the Buddha teaching is gentle and peaceful

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.000
.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 That is really they say.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.690
 Good conduct, gentle and peaceful is a sign of that knowledge they learn from the teaching of the

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.000
 Buddha absorbed in the heart.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Heart.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And the sign of meditation practice achievement is less emotions, less negative emotions.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Those are proper village usage.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 In our village, when I was born, proper usage, those are the signs.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 It is true.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 True.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 This is what it is.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So, remember that.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And then, next one, this, the pain and endeavor, that more division.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 What in the teaching said?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Said, true always, always increasing the understanding of the Buddha teachings.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And Buddha gave many different teachings.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 From day one, his teaching at 35 and all the way at 81, he gave lot of teachings.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 All those teachings are known, summarized as nayana teachings.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Teachings.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And always learn, study and observing them.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And use that to improve our practice and meditate.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Not just intellectually, kind of like that and then leave that.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 We are practitioners.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 We are practicing lineage.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Lineage, we are enjoying and practicing lineage.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Not going to carry it by only academic levels.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 We are going to observe that academic, what to learn to the heart and develop these teachings

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 as a Buddha teacher, as a Buddha famous somebody.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 So, this is the word.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 This is the word.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 And then, next one is what?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 And always trying to improve yourself.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Next one, always improve.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 You are going to, we are going to take ourself.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Who is going to take ourself?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Ourself, such as mindfulness, introspection and thought force.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Those are always going to take ourself.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Once on, improve.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.250
 Have something that we did mistakes and something not suitable with it to me, to the others or to

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.000
 myself.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Once on, self to the others, avoid that.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Try not to repeat that again and again.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Again and which is not good.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Apply the common sense to that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 So, these are all known as part of the e, per the e-devils.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 And then meditators.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Meditating and practice of meditating.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 And our brother during the meditating, so there is also meditation, conduct,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and meditation times conduct.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 When you apply the technique in meditation, then what you can do?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Again conduct.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 In the Buddha teaching, generally they say there is ten virtuous conduct.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 That what you do, it has such a tremendous merit.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 That is what in the teaching of the Buddha Chakra Manasit.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 All that which is also defeated by the great master of the future of the Buddha,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Maiti, Maiti has repeated that.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 And those are such as in the like, what is called the post-meditator

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 or the period of the meditator.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Your meditation between period.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 And those are such as Duhinda, Yogi, Dravas, writing the Buddha's teachings.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Yogi and Dravas.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 True.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And making offerings.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 One is the Buddha second up the scripture, writing domes or tapings.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Or whatever you do.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 It's meditator activities.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 It is not just a comment because the Buddha teaching is teaching of love,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 teaching of compassion, teaching of non-violence.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Teaching that will explain how to explore our goodness.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 To let that shine to every living being.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Make every living being also in that standards.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 It's not just one is spirit or other is imperious.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 All is in heaven.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 The light, the shining stars of the Buddha nature

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 is hiding in every one's heart and mind.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And trying to revert that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 So writing or the scripting, writing that is the very choice.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Second is offerings.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Such as making offerings to the Shairas, to the temples,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 or to whatever you do, offerings.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Those are the second is being meditator.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Again, of course, I won't go all this again to each of those.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Third is offering to the noble ones and generously to the poor ones.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Third is generously.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Making generously.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Giving gift as needed persons.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 If you can do according or capabilities.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Those all are meditators.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 You're going to teach them.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And then the fourth one is listening to the teachings.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Listen to the teachings.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Teachings.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And that is meditator activities.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 That means also reading.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 You're reading.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Reading texts.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Feeling teachings.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Each time you read, observe those teachings.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Because it's really teaching of our mind, as I said many times.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Our nature of the mind.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Or our nature or something connected with our body's mind or others.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Others, their body's mind.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And how to bring joy and peace.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 That is, read those books.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 And then, more also.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And I'm sorry that that is not.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 So that is listening.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And the third is.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 One.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Piv.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Thank you.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Piv is then listening.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 If somebody is reading text.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 That is what they're teaching.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Listen.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Listen.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 As we go in the musics, listen the musics.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 We go to the rock and roll shots too.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And then we listen too.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 But this is a very gentle, rocky rock and roll.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Listen.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Listen that teaching.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 And again, not just listen indeed.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And let it go.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Each word, those are really something important.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Let, absorb that in heart and mind.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Let that sit the length.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Let glorify our nature of the mind.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Our qualities.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Our goodness.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Goodness.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And then, the next one is keeping the text.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Keeping the teachings.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And hold on the shrines.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 All keeping holding that teaching.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 All holding the teaching.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 The other day, the teaching can be divided into two.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Teaching is like scriptural teaching.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 That which is book poems.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And then, the meaning teaching is the love and kindness and compassion.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 All this is the meaning teaching.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And holding it to the heart and mind.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Mind.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Those are all known as holding the teaching of the Buddha.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And then, reflecting on the meaning of the teaching that you learned.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Meaning of the teachings.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And the final one, right, is ten.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 The next one.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 One.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Seven.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Is it seven?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 No.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 It's seven.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Again.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Next one is teaching.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Giving teachings.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 All your...

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 You are sharing that to the others.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Your unrestrained thoughts.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Cheating.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And then, the next one is...

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 You are also repeating those teachings.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 As what we call repetitions.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Or memorize and read this.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 This as your daily practices.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 It comes about.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 And then, the final one is meditating.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 The meaning of that meditating.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Those ten are, as the great Master Maitre said,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 these are the ten activities of the virtues.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Whoever do this, or in one of these,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 it has tremendous meritorious.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Say that.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 So those who are known as the activities of the meritorious.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Do after your practice sessions.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Or meditation sessions.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Practice sessions.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Then, along with that, other things in the debate,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 and also do, such as post-retions.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And circumambulating to the temples.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Or circumambulating to the stupas.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And then, also do the ceremonies.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Such as, generally the ceremonies,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 we call them water ceremonies.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 That I don't really quite popular here yet.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 That water ceremonies.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 And then, as well as...

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Yeah, so those are all known as the meritorious activities.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Meritorious activities, as much as during the period of this.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 It's all known as the meritorious activities.
