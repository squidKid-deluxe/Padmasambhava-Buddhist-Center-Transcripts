00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200
 So, again, welcome and thank you. Again, as we begin any activity, especially our study

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:21.400
 contemplation and practice, really connecting with these three essential motivations that

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.320
 are really the seed and heart of all of our realization of the nine jnanas is so fundamental

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.800
 and important and really sits us right in the right spot. So, again, just reflecting

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.080
 with a joy and appreciation on our really super-duper, extraordinary, precious human

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:58.840
 birth with all of its freedoms and advantages and beautiful circumstances, and also connecting

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 with that beautiful motivation that with this precious human birth we'll truly find the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 deep nectar of meaning and direct perception of the Buddha's beautiful teachings and come

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.360
 to realization of that so we can truly be only a benefit for beings and really make

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:32.640
 big change for our own course as well as for infinite beings. And with that seeding and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 becoming more and more familiar with the innate purity of all appearances, which are just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:52.200
 a beautiful display of our primordial Buddha mind, and with great trust in that and all

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:07.480
 the perfections will kind of continue our practice. And so today I was thinking we've

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 been kind of slowly going through these four thoughts that turn the mind towards the dharma.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.080
 And in particular today looking at this fourth thought, you know, reflecting on the defects

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:38.240
 of samsara as it's called. As we begin our nundra practice, we're chanting these four

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 thoughts that turn our mind towards the dharma, towards what's reliable, towards what's meaningful.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.240
 But we're not only chanting that as we do any of our practice as much as we can reflect

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.380
 deeply with our hearts on what the meaning is, which also means a little bit outside

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.120
 of our formal practice. We really take time to contemplate these things. So these four

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.200
 thoughts that turn the mind toward the dharma aren't just limited to, you know, kind of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.520
 the liturgy of the words we're saying in our nundra text and even, you know, that meaning.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.160
 But because our nundra practice is the fundamental foundation of all the practice we're ever

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:47.160
 going to do, we know it's critical to kind of be familiar with these four thoughts. In

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.760
 fact, our lineage teachers ceaselessly remind us that not just with like our, in our formal

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.080
 nundra text, we have these four thoughts embedded there. But before any practice, reflecting

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.600
 on these four thoughts is really said to really ensure that our practice will really move

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.840
 forward and be of benefit. Again, and so what are again, I'm just going to quickly review,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.000
 what are these four thoughts that turn the mind toward the dharma or the four renunciation

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 thoughts they're also called. So reflecting on our precious human birth, reflecting on

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.480
 impermanence, reflecting on the natural law of cause and effect or karma of actions and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.200
 their inevitable results. And then reflecting on samsara, the suffering of samsara, the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:05.160
 all-pervading nature of samsara is suffering. And so why, why do we do this? Because it's

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.640
 just reminding of us about the truths we live with, like all of the dharma. These are kind

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:20.280
 of more ordinary truths, but often we're kind of naively forget them or get caught up in

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.520
 our habitual patterns and assumptions of how things are and who we are and what will bring

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.080
 us happiness and etc, etc. So by reflecting on these four thoughts, really, like Rinpoche

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.000
 says, it helps to soften our hard heads and open, bring some warmth and moisture to our

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.600
 heart, really see our situation as it is, which naturally is going to turn our mind

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:56.880
 towards what's reliable, what's more deeper, all-pervading, reliable kind of truth of ourselves

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:06.720
 and of everything. So this fourth thought is reflecting on the kind of the unsatisfier

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.120
 factory nature of samsara. And like we know, the very first teaching that Buddha Shakyamuni

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:26.000
 gave in this world was the four noble truths. The very first one of those four noble truths

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.400
 is the truth of suffering. And then of course, so just by doing this, the Buddha is really

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:43.160
 acknowledging how important it is to acknowledge suffering, or like as Rinpoche often says,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:55.000
 the challenges we have, that there's always something off within our mind, right?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.920
 Buddha just stressed again and again how important it is to acknowledge and recognize suffering,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:17.200
 our own suffering and the suffering of others. So the three realms of cyclic existence have

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:30.720
 the nature of an ocean of suffering. So what are the three realms and what is cyclic existence

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:39.160
 - what are the three realms of cyclic existence? And I think a lot of us know this, but again

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.600
 we're reflecting on these things and these words we're saying, the three realms of cyclic

00:07:45.600 --> 00:08:02.560
 existence are what's known as the desire realm, form realm and formless realm. And so that's

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:12.880
 another way of framing what the Buddha called samsara, the six realms of samsara or cyclic

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:22.240
 existence. So that's the hell realms, the hungry ghost realms, the animal realms, human

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:37.040
 realms, the asuras and the gods. So these six realms, that's all of samsara, just as real

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.320
 for every being within it. And like the Buddha said, as vast as far as their space, their

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:53.640
 sentient beings, as much as their sentient beings, their suffering, right? Each being

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:02.260
 has by its very nature, the Buddha nature, and yet due to this miracle of not knowing,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:12.920
 we experience samsara and ever flowing within that. So these six realms of samsara are within

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:23.360
 these three realms. Now the desire realm spans all up from all the hell realms, all the hunger

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.200
 ghost realms, all the animal realms, all the human realms, all the asuras and then the

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:38.600
 lower realms of the gods is all what's within this desire realm. So then the God realms

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.200
 is the only kind of realm of class of samsara beings that exists in all three realms. So

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:54.320
 above the gods that are in the desire realm are the gods of the formless realm. And then

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.960
 kind of above that are the, I mean, are the form gods form realm. Above that is the formless

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.560
 realm. And again, you can look at more charts and details about what these are like. And

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:25.520
 but that's essentially important. I just thought to say that because I know a few people have

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:37.040
 so as far as these realms go, vast, infinite, none are free from suffering due to ignorance,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:47.960
 attachment, aversion, hope and fear and the actions kind of based on that, you know, delusion,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:56.600
 and all of samsara comes out. And then there's this word, the cyclic existence or samsara

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:09.040
 is a Sanskrit word. And then in Tibetan is korwa. And the word meaning of samsara means

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:26.440
 something like unceasing flow or unceasing flowing unceasing wand ceaseless wandering,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:33.680
 continuous wandering, that's kind of the word meaning of samsara. And then our great teachers

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:44.040
 with Tibetan is the word korwa or which implies the circle or circling, which is that idea

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:53.760
 that from beginningless time, you me, all of us, all the infinite beings of samsara

00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:04.120
 have been circling in not knowing. And all these very, very real experiences ranging

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:13.600
 from ultimate torment to great bliss, and the great loss of losing it all. And like

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.320
 Buddha said, you know, this word of cyclic, like in some of the Vinaya, you know, there's

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.320
 these quotes, even Kenshin Pauld and Rinpoche gives in these four foundational thoughts

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.560
 in our treasury of prayers, these quotes from some of the sutras. But there's the one that's

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:41.560
 like driven by ignorance, you know, you know, craving and wishing to be to exist. All the

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:48.560
 beings of all the realms are circling, you know, foolishly wishing happiness, but doing

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.960
 all the things that don't get it. You know, so all of the realms were going round and

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.400
 round, you know, like a potter's wheel, just ceaselessly spinning. And then also like the

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:07.640
 famous quotes of like how all the three realms are just ablaze with the sufferings of old

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:17.680
 age, sickness, death, hope and fear. Raging, you know, there's kind of no protection and

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:25.480
 beings are just like the bees caught in a side of a jar going up and down and all around.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:44.340
 Here we are. So the three realms of cyclic existence have the nature of an ocean of suffering.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.880
 So looking at this suffering truth is really looking at, of course, it's important we think

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:59.400
 about the causes, but looking at the results. And we're reminded again and again by our

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:08.840
 teachers, you know, that each one of us, again, from beginningless time has been wandering

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:23.760
 in samsara, creating all kinds of doing all kinds of actions, creating all kinds of karma.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.080
 You know, if if we were to, you know, pile up, make little beads of every life we've

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:37.360
 lived, it wouldn't fill the world or the universe, you know, all the even though we may not

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.880
 remember

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:46.000
 it, all of the experiences we've had as hell beings, as hungry ghosts, as animals, as humans,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.640
 as a suras, as gods that said in the teachings, we've really done it all again and again and

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:03.240
 again. We've had countless relations with each other of enmity, of great love and care,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:13.960
 of total betrayal, every imaginable thing it seems we've had. And yet we continue circling.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:21.120
 So how fortunate it is that we actually have the light of Dharma and the deeper teachings

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:30.100
 of again, not only the fruit of that of suffering, but the deeper truth of the natural nature

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.400
 in which all of this is experienced, our very own mind, and that heart, and that path to

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.360
 realize that and bring out our Buddha nature to fruition, again, to benefit beings. But

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:53.160
 looking at these sufferings of samsara is, you know, very good and important kind of

00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:00.480
 helps again, really soften our heart, wake us up to like, what's going on, even if we

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:09.940
 as human beings in this world, right? Here in Padmasamulang, it's so beautiful, so peaceful.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:17.820
 Of course, I've got my own, you know, challenges. I'm sure we all do. There's always things

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.280
 to do, et cetera, et cetera. But relatively speaking, even just within this limited knowledge

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:33.480
 of the world, just think of all these awful wars and atrocities happening this very moment.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:51.420
 Our brothers and sisters just going through so much. So looking at all these six realms

00:16:51.420 --> 00:17:04.840
 and not just having it be like an intellectual exercise, but really reading about these,

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.400
 you know, like I brought up words of my perfect teacher, which is such an easy book to have.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.560
 If anyone doesn't have it, it really, this is a treasure to have, you know, these beautiful

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.340
 teachings from Patra Rinpoche. And of course, there's so many other nundra. These are nundra

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:32.440
 teachings. But in this Patra Rinpoche goes through, you know, all these defects of samsara.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:41.120
 What are the six realms? You know, what did the hell realms contain, right? It goes, you

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:49.920
 know, much, much further than just being a general place. But you know, what are the

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:59.600
 hell realms? What's going on in them? Like we're told, there's these 18 hells. Eight

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:10.440
 are pervaded by the suffering of heat and pain. Eight by just cold and freezing. Then

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:19.160
 there's what's known as the neighboring hells, places like ceaseless kind of swamps of putrid

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:42.320
 corpses, etc. And then kind of what are they called? neighboring, neighboring or what's

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.640
 the word curse? It will come to me. But I thought, yeah, there's just not really time

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:59.280
 here for the amount of time we have. But maybe we can just say their names, the 18 hells.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:06.680
 There's eight hot hells, you know, pervaded by again, like I said, the torture of heat

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:15.160
 and pain. You know, again, due to the ripening of all of our negative actions, but in particular

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:26.000
 our hostile, angry hatred actions, you know, so the highest of the of the hell realms is

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.320
 called the reviving hell, where just everyone's fighting ceaselessly and hacking each other

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:42.120
 to bits until they're all dead. And then instantly a big voice comes and everyone is resurrected.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:58.960
 It said that I think the amount of time there is about five. Let's see, let's see, what

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:13.960
 does it say? One human year, 50 human years is one day and the lowest of the God realms.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:23.840
 The beings in this realm live for about 500 years. And then each realm going down deeper

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:35.840
 into the hells, it compounds by like factors of two. The black line hell, where again the

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:45.040
 main pain is being traced out black lines and then cut up along the lines, rounding

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:56.400
 up and crushing hell, the howling hell, the great howling hell, the heating hell. You

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.600
 know, they're everyone I think is in huge cauldrons of molten metal. And every now and

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:12.620
 then we bob up and these, you know, agents hook us and hammer our heads and till we pass

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:20.000
 out and that's happiness in that hell. But then of course, and all of these were ceaselessly

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.480
 reviving again and living for hundreds, thousands of years, which are much longer than our sense

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:39.600
 of years. The intense heating hell and then the hell of ultimate torment. And then it

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.680
 said around all these hells, there's these neighboring hells of like one just full of

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:53.880
 hot embers, another full of razors, another full of swords, and another full of like these

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.760
 trees which these fierce dogs chase you up, but their thorns are going, you know, coming

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:07.920
 down. So it's pain in all directions. Anyway, the eight cold hells are ceaselessly colder.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:16.590
 Our bodies are freezing and cracking and blistering, you know, like lotuses. And then these ephemer

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.720
al

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.520
 hells. That's the word I think I was trying to get to. They're here and there and everywhere,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:33.680
 like being born inside a stone or identifying our cell, our bodies as rope, etc. There's

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:42.160
 lots of details here. And the point is really reading these details. The predators, the

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:51.040
 hungry ghosts, again, the main suffering here is just never getting what you want. Our bodies

00:22:51.040 --> 00:23:00.400
 are huge and maybe our mouth the size of a pin, our stomach as huge as the ocean, starving.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:08.800
 And then when we finally get what we want, it makes us sick. Or we're just never always

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:16.720
 seeing, you know, mirages chasing after them, never being fulfilled, you know, is the main

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:24.680
 suffering of the hungry ghosts or the yadaks, the animal realm, the suffering of the animal

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:32.480
 realms, there's animals, again, beyond our perception, but ceaselessly just being blown

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:39.680
 here and there, either being swallowed by others or boring themselves into the bodies

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:46.600
 of others, you know, those of more intelligence are always on the lookout, always afraid of

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:57.920
 being, you know, devoured or being, you know, taken advantage of. The human realms, which

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:12.520
 we all know, right, there's all these basic sufferings in the human realm. There's birth,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:30.920
 the suffering we go through in birth, kind of old age, sickness, death. There's what's

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:49.480
 called the suffering of the aggregate or conditioned things. And what does that one mean? It means,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:58.760
 even like our good vegetarian food, countless beings have died, just in the process of planting

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:08.400
 and harvesting that food. That's an example that just because of our karma, our habitual

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:20.840
 pattern, the circumstances of our samsara is such that there's always going to be trouble

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:29.040
 that's somehow caught up in even our happiness and even in our most pure aspiration, you

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:37.760
 know, the best we can do, still somebody somewhere is going to suffer. But again, the important

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:45.320
 thing to remember is this isn't the ultimate truth. This is all within this illusion, this

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:52.120
 duality display of mind is samsara. So we need to, again, according to right that we know

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.600
 with karma, we need to be very timid and careful and mindful. And that's why it's so important

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:08.080
 to look at all these realms. So the human realm, we've had this suffering of everything

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.760
 composite, which is what I was just going over, which means again, everything's connected,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.600
 somehow, somebody's going to hurt, get hurt somewhere with anything we do, just walking

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:27.520
 on the earth, we're crushing beings, you know, etc, etc. There's the suffering of change.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.200
 Just we all suffer, even though we know in permanence, we still suffer when things change.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.240
 It's uncomfortable. We're losing something. Then there's what's called the suffering upon

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.720
 suffering, where we might have one thing that's challenging happening. And then on top of

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:54.360
 that, another thing is happening, you know, we get sick, and then also, you know, we have

00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:02.440
 to go, you know, our house burns down, you know, or there's all kinds of permutations

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.600
 of suffering upon suffering, I kind of think it kind of speaks for itself. But it's not

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.640
 when it's not just one problem, but one problem on top of another on top of another on top

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:23.760
 of another are a lot of these, you know, human sufferings. And then there's these four other

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:31.460
 basic sufferings. And what are they? They're the kind of the challenge and the kind of

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:41.420
 uncomfortable fear of meeting people who antagonize us. You know, our enemies are, you know, kind

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:54.320
 of challenging ones. And the fear of losing those we love, and that support us. And then

00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:01.540
 the suffering one, you know, of encountering things that we just don't want at all, beyond

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:08.600
 like challenging people, circumstances and things that we just don't want that suffering,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:17.200
 and then not getting what we do want. And another big suffering that Ken Rinpoche has

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:28.360
 always mentioned so much, with especially of humans, doubt and hesitation. The Asuras,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.820
 you know, and again, are always just wracked with jealousy and quarreling and fighting

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:39.600
 with the gods. The gods main suffering. Again, now I'm rushing because I think I'm going

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:47.280
 a little too long. But as we all know, is falling down, they might have beautiful, graceful

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:54.920
 lives in any one of these realms of, you know, desire, fulfillment of desire, you know, or

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:06.020
 forms kind of geometric bliss, or the formless realm of just one pointed samadhi. But at

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:14.800
 some point, that karma is exhausted. And then due to the big mind and cognition of the gods,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:20.320
 they see they've exhausted and that's the big suffering of the gods as we know, is then

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:26.040
 losing all the merit, exhausting all the positive karma they've collected. And then all the

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.300
 shadows of their previous karma from countless lifetimes kind of bringing them inevitably

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:40.120
 blowing towards whatever their next life will be. So then, again, an important thing we're

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:47.320
 reminding you to do as we're looking at suffering is read these books. I'm sorry, I don't have

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.640
 the, you know, not sorry, I don't have the time, but we're so wonderful that we have

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.880
 all these books, you know, but again, the point is really read and, and it's said in

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:06.020
 the instructions. Don't just think about this abstractly. Just like we're reading about,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:13.040
 you know, the people in Gaza, or Ukraine, or in Sudan, or wherever, or whatever's happening

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:22.200
 environmentally to the animals, you know, you know, we might read about that, put yourself,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:29.080
 we need to put ourselves just like we are those people. And what is that like? And then

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:38.080
 do the same for like each one of these realms. If we ourselves were born, you know, like

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.000
 in like the reviving hell, where it said, you know, like our skin is as sensitive as

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:52.960
 our eyeballs, you know, and all of these just horrible, terrifying circumstances are happening.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:31:00.200
 And just, you know, immense pain that's just as real as this is real for us, putting ourselves

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:08.680
 in that place. And how long are we living through that hundreds of what for our conception

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:16.080
 from human conception, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years might be just one day

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:25.480
 in one of the hells, for example. So what is the place? What are our bodies like? What

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:33.520
 are the sufferings we're experiencing really imagining? What is that like? For how long?

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.480
 What's the cause of this? And then again, with our in so and again, we're kind of getting

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.720
 that real taste of dissatisfaction scene. That's why it's called the defects we've chosen

00:31:47.720 --> 00:32:03.880
 due to our, you know, that kind of naivete, we've chosen samsara. And so we're realizing,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:12.080
 oh, you know, from beginningless time, we've been wandering through all these experiences.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:20.400
 So really connecting with that, just like, no, yep, dissatisfaction, you know, disillusioned

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.880
 with what samsara has to offer. Even in again, that's not to say of course there's good things

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:36.640
 in samsara, because we all have that beautiful nature of love, compassion, wisdom, freedom,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.280
 you know, those qualities, of course, they reflect in samsara, we're very fortunate that

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:52.120
 there's more apparent for us. And still this lamp of our empty nature of wisdom, compassion,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:33:00.880
 love, as we kind of lean into these experiences and let that illuminate with our bodhicitta.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.920
 And then not only have the disillusion with samsara as an experience that we're going

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:16.800
 to have unless we really apply these beautiful teachings. But also the think of then all

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:23.440
 these beings, think of not just yourself as each of these beings in each one of these

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:31.360
 realms, but think of, you know, like classically, our own mother. We're witnessing these things

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.840
 happening to our own mother, someone who's given us such immense generosity and kindness,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:44.600
 no matter what they're called, going through these. And then, you know, with that sincere

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:52.440
 bodhicitta wishing, taking that kind of conviction and responsibility to truly be of benefit

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.920
 and free them from suffering. And again, not just the temporary fruit of suffering, but

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:06.040
 the causes of that suffering. And again, connecting with our four boundless, our precious human

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:14.440
 birth, knowing and permanence, the inevitability of karma, reflecting on samsara, you know,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:20.160
 then naturally our mind is turning towards the dharma. So with that big bodhicitta and

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.320
 really looking as much as we can to these words from the omniscient Buddha of what beings

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:33.160
 go through, and for how long and where and that we've experienced all these things, and

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:42.120
 we can continue to experience these things or not, you know, refrain from harm, engage

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:50.760
 in benefit, tame our own mind. So and then for the benefit of everyone, so I'll, I'll

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:58.680
 just stop here, maybe we can say more in the future. My apologies if I've forgotten some

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.920
 important big part, but just these are a few morsels we can really I think if we really

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.320
 each one of us take the heart and of course, each one of you have your own relation to

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.800
 these teachings and their own beautiful, deep, profound meaning. That's really the point

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:22.760
 of reflecting, you know, as a group, I'm sorry, it's just one way with our webcast. But again,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:30.720
 just doing, trying to do my best to like kind of inspire myself and all of us to connect

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:40.320
 with the teachings and just this beautiful, amazing gift that we have out of out of our

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.160
 good fortune in our good karma. And so I really pray we all continue to develop that and nurture

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:55.960
 that and bring that to real direct fruition and benefit everyone. So we'll just continue

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.160
 with our nundra practice, taking all of this to heart.
