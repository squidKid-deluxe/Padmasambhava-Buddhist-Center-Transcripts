 For them, we don't separate anything. Study and practices are combined. And that's called

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:17.600
 "Hierdha Tsondra". "Hierdha" means "Dropa" or "Sondra" in Tibetan. Study and practices

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 are combined together. Together, that is, in a "Tsoni" or "Sondra". Accumulating marriage

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 are combined together. If we do that, we practice, then we will achieve the "Kuni" or "Sondra"

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:48.640
 in Tibetan. Which means "Thirikayas are united union". So practicing studying is a union,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 and two marriages are union. The result, because of that, is the result of the achievement of

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:05.480
 the three "Tukayas" are in union status. Therefore, we cannot separate it. Separate it. And for

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.300
 that reason, even though we are studying, it's known as "Hierdha", we cannot follow it one

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.960
 or another. But always, I cannot touch that all teachings are really absorbed into the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.000
 heart. It's all our nature of the mind. So always touch that back to the nature. Each

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.560
 time, when we touch in the teachings on that, it is the glorified meaning of our nature,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 our beauty, our quality. If we observe in that way, then our mind becomes more gentle,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 peaceful, more joy, more appreciation, more respectful, and more humble, and more simple,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.720
 down to the ground, not hovering in the sky, at least in that place, and then losing the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 ground. That is not the style of the practice. Practice are very grounded, grounded on the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.680
 beautiful foundation of that what we were discussing. Humble and simple, and very thought,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.600
 very step-back post, politeness. Those are our whole quality of the practices. And what

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.360
 the Buddhist Buddha teaching said in the New Mar schools, and they always say, "The sign

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.920
 of the starting and knowing the Buddha teaching is very gentle and peaceful manner. Manner

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.560
 become very peaceful, manner become very gentle, manner become very full-likefulness, and that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.880
 is a sign of that you really are gentleman and lady, gentle lady, but ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.200
 that is sign of the practices. And the sign, sorry, sign of the startings. Sign of the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 practice is less emotions. It is very versatile. "Tuta sheshintrova gomta nyumum eva." Sign

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.040
 of the starting and the knowledge is gentle, manner. Sign of the practice is walking as

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.760
 you practice, less emotions. All emotions arising, you handle immediately, is not further

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.080
 more disturbance to your, one's own self, to the others. That is the really, the practicing

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.120
 is going to the right direction. Starting is going the right direction. But otherwise,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 if you practice and starting, we sit at it so many years. We practice so many years of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.560
 our emotions become stronger, stronger, stronger. Our manners become more irregular, more irregular

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.800
,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.520
 even more violent than those drunk persons in the streets. That becomes, then, our teaching

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:51.840
 is not really observing. That question, it's questionable, questionable. And look this,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.240
 for example, Buddha, we read life's rule of Buddha, Kya kya muni. How gentle, how peaceful.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 How more calm and fruitful, holding the bathing bowl, house bowl,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.680
 walking with bare sticks, wearing the regular robes.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.320
 Read that. That is gracious teacher, our gracious teacher. Then our teachers, all those, such as

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.560
 Hizal Dojo. How really humble and simple, for example. You may have, you did it, maybe so.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.040
 I had the opportunity for you to ask, so Hizal Dojo. How gentle, how peaceful, don't

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.000
 to the earth, don't to the earth. And I can't keep on Hizal Dojo too. How simple, how humble,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.400
 how humble, how simple, don't to the earth. And then Hizal dojo, for example, now the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.760
 leaving great masters. How really humble and simple. Simple, never claiming anything that

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.720
 such as this and that things. He always is one of the citizens of the old world. He's nothing but

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.960
 then the follow, following the teaching of the Buddha. He always proclaims that. Those all are

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.760
 known as, as humble and simple. Even though these great beings are truly emanated beings,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.080
 not just the regular average beings. Those are what we know now. So therefore, again,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.320
 this all started with this, our mind. So they rested, we do motivation and thought,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.520
 and then joy and application. And now we look like the teaching itself.
