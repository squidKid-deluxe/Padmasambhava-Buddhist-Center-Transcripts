00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400
 "First of all, of course, as long as we are in samsara, or as long as we are at the reach of the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 river, our activity will never end."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.160
 "There are always activities. When we discover the river, we have activities known as samsara

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 activities."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.180
 "When we discover the river completely, and then we have activities known as namakaya and samukaya

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.000
 activities."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 "So there is always an activity that is just part of the display, there is nothing really there."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.310
 "But when we are trying to discover our rupa, rupa in that processes, then our activities, we can

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.000
 cooperate with that video."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 "Again, the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, highlighted that, six paramata practices."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.790
 "Six paramata practices, first is generosity, second is morality, third is patience, and the fourth

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 is joyful effort."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 "And the concentration, the wisdom."

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 "So in the teaching said, you must be cooperating with all your activities, particularly we are

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.000
 talking now as post-meditation, trying to cooperate with the six paramatas."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 "And when you cooperate with that with samsara matas, and then in the simple world what we are

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.000
 using here, not too much grasping, clinging."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 "Even is generosity, we should not grasping, clinging too much."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 "Even is morality, even is patience."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.740
 "Whatever clinging is clinging, for that reason, Buddha Shakyamuni mentioned, magical of the six

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 paramatas."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 "Magical of the six paramatas, all like magical activities."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 "That means, again, in the Buddha Shakyamuni mentioned, we are also like magic."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 "It's not some substrate, it's solid artistic."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 "The six paramata is our activity."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 "So our activity, since we are also magic, the six paramata is also like magical activities."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 "One of these magical activities is completely vast on a kundal, bodhicata, and formless."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 "And then we do that, that is all, and we have that attitude, and we do that within that frame."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 "That is in the Buddha's teaching, named as 'meritory activities.'"

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.350
 "It is merit, and this merit is so important. According to Buddha's teaching, to reach

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.000
 enlightenment, we need merit."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 "And how many merits?"

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 "All merits can be summarized into two merits."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 "Accumulate merit, and what's the merit?"

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 "These two merits are as wings of the bird, or two feet of our sub, to walk."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 "With all that, we won't get to any further."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 "So therefore, and we can do all those activities."

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 "And then also, with those thoughts."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 "And then, we need to encounter with different circumstances."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 "And apply the jockey techniques, liberating."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 "And again, bring the thought."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 "And then, in Mahayana taking many times,"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 "and even having trouble with this challenge."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 "You have a really courageous commitment."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 "And in Mahayana, these are learning lessons."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 "It's a lesson, it's a lesson."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 "And we have three lessons."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 "That is wonderful, because it's a free lesson."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 "We know the lesson, we're never going to become the rasas."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 "Rasas."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 "And we're never going to become the warriors."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 "So it is like warriors in all this, because it's all really."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 "This is with great, with all different perspectives."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 "What the greatest teacher is doing."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 "All those great master's taught."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 "All this, how to really improve."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 "How to bring, how to stay our sub-steams."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 "Of the identity, of the beauty, of the rupa."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 "And all those tools, whatever we can use, whatever we can remember."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 "Apply that, then we are really moving in a beautiful right direction."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 "And at the same time, we are accumulating all those inheritance."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Thank you.
