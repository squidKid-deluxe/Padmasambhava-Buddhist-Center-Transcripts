00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Thank you very much for coming. Thank you for this great speech. Thank you. Thank you everyone.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.750
 Now, of course, again, now we continue with the teachings that we've been doing for the past, last

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.640
 years.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 Years of the teachings of Dzogchen and the following. The teachings of the according to the great

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.480
 master in the yogi and the master of the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.410
 Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol, and as well as the others too. We've come to put together, I try to put

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.760
 together my letter of

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.000
 clarifications so that we can easily, a little bit of understanding more to all of us. So that's

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.120
 what we've been doing.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 And this is the one that, again, bring to a moment in our life, truly, I believe, and we are having

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 a lot of talk about making and editing. You met all different editing and then come to here and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 practice is really wonderful. We all have, you have,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.500
 particularly you all have busy lives and a too many things, too many different ways. And organizing

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.280
 is really a lot of things and making that beautiful efforts.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.480
 And your commitment to come to this and the various practices and also kind of discovering or

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.280
 little bit

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 activating, understanding, reminding of all the teachings you received from the many great masters

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.280
 in the way. A little bit more additional clarification, or at least the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 reminding of all the teachings and which is so wonderful, so beautiful. And as Buddha told in all

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.200
 the great masters, so this is one of the beautiful moments.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 And therefore again, always in the teachings, whether you're starting the teaching, whether you're

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.120
 contemplating the teaching, whether you're meditating in the practice in the teaching,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.220
 always it is so important to correct our visual motivation. Generally, we all have a good

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.600
 motivation, visual motivation. That's what we're here to get at.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 And that motivation is a joy in appreciation in both each other and devotions, though. But however,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.600
 due to our all this emotion and negative forces of the habit dependence,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.940
 sometimes it blurs away all those things and then just kind of like continuing killing the mundane

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.850
 conceptions of thought and really kind of very attracted with our, what's called this habit

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.600
 dependence.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.850
 Therefore, always in the teaching, they said that correct the motivation. In every teaching, and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.850
 when we read the teaching, the living masters, when they read the teaching, they said, and also in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.600
 the teaching, when we read the books,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.340
 they said correct the motivation. That's so important. In the end, the Buddha's teaching is not

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.350
 externally something we have to do too many things. The correct mind is so important. That's what

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.600
 the Buddha said.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.330
 Just blend your own mind or subjugate only your mind. This is my teaching. That's what the teaching

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.600
 said.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.540
 It's to discover, or kind of some new way of looking to the mind is so important. For that reason,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.040
 in the beginning, a joy in appreciation in both each other and understanding of the nature of the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.600
 old purity politics.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.660
 And we read of those old politics. This is not just a kind of like we're doing something extra

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.600
 besides our practices. This is really practices.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.020
 And this is the one called accumulated merit. To merit. What's the merit? Accumulated merit. Joy in

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.600
 appreciation in both each other.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.370
 And also, purely discovering, purely understanding all those are accumulated merit. Merit is so

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.600
 important to actualize the realization.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.890
 So therefore, again, bring more joy, more appreciation. Appreciation is that we have those

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 beautiful opportunities. We are beautiful beings.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.160
 We have 18 endowments. Plus, we have more and more, 10 luxury qualities really we have. And above

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.600
 that, we have all the perfect conditions to do practices.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.390
 That even those great masters at ancient times did not have what we have now. All the facilities

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.600
 and supporters, the kind of community, that everything.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.090
 And many teachings often mentioned, we read the books and all that. Many great masters of the emer

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.600
itus practice on the caves.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.790
 In the moment, you see, it looks like a very kind of appealing, nice thing. But in reality, there

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.600
 is no running water, no heated rooms on the caves.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.700
 And there is no, really, any kind of all the facilities just sitting in the caves and meditating in

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.600
 practice.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.920
 Yet, for their joy and appreciation, courage and commitment, they never complained. They never

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.600
 thought it was bad.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.590
 They're so happy and excited, the joy, really singing the songs of the joy and appreciation and the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.600
 devotions. That's the one.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.700
 We have more than that. Everything is organized. Everything is editing. Yet, every temperature,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.600
 everything is kind of like according to our desires.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.000
 We have all this, really. It's like, it comes from almost real land, I would say. When you're

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.600
 thinking that, we should, really, this is very luxurious, very spacious.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.660
 So, for that, well, the midst of this luxurious college, and then put it, have some ability to kind

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.600
 of have courage and commitment.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 Use this our time as to practice it. And to activate it is so, so special and important.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.600
 Practice it means, you know, we're discovering the luxurious of the mind. Why? That, well, we take.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 We will have that luxurious.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.010
 We will make ourselves happy and peaceful, joy. But when we leave this world, we will take that

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.600
 with us.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 This luxurious college, anything that we do not, with our mind, we're not going to leave behind.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 Behind. We go with that. This is called interlocurious. Interlocurious, really.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.080
 Ex-interlocurious, whatever we have, whatever we use, it is beautiful. All the good purpose, all

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.600
 that.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.340
 But, we leave behind. And that also becomes the legacy in the regions. And also a beneficial for

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.600
 all the beings.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.020
 For something we develop with our mind, our nature of that, develop and discover our innate nature

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.600
 of mind, we go with that.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 That and a treasure is so special. So practice and meditation is to discover our treasures.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 And this, so therefore, again, we promote joy and appreciation with that.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 And then, always in the teaching said, is true in both each other.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.190
 And great master Kamala Shira is the reason, meditation, there's three stages of meditation that he

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.600
 gives.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 And the second stage is already translated.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 He told that Dalai Lama is really gave that teaching so many times in Thailand.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:04.260
 Maybe, if you read that book, it's really very good. But if you didn't read that book, it's so

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.600
 beautiful.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 And the second meditation, Gomorrah Parpa in the communities.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 And there, I mean, it's just Buddha teaching. Buddha teaching.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.980
 He's the Buddha, he recursively by the Kintasandev thing. And so Kamala Shira came, and he recurs

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.600
ively by the Kintasandev thing.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.600
 And all the students, he taught three famous teachings, particularly collected to the meditation.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.880
 And those are some of the big first meditation instruction, second meditation instruction, and

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.600
 third meditation instruction.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 Those are roughly trustworthy, but it's a really good translation.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.930
 I'm sure it's trustworthy, very perfectly, because his only Dalai Lama gave that teaching many

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.600
 times.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 So it's all in there.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 He said, the enlightenment is not coming without any cause and conditions.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Enlightenment has to have cause and conditions.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.600
 That cause also has to be lined up with exactly enlightenment, not just any cause, any conditions.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 So what is cause and condition of enlightenment?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 And that is, he said, in the Great Master, the greatest teacher, Buddha said in the teaching,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
 that enlightenment, the root of enlightenment, is compassion.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.600
 And cause of enlightenment is bodhicam.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 The condition of enlightenment is a skillful means of the six params of the practices.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 Then, when we put together that, we really get enlightenment.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 We have the perfect cause and the perfect conditions, and then get enlightenment.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 So that's what the Great Master said that is.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.350
 Therefore, the compassion, the root of the compassion, is the root of enlightenment, the compassion

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.600
.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 So root of the bodhicata is compassion.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 And what did the teaching say there?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.600
 Bodhicata, of course, we talk a lot in the teaching, so many times,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 but put down, break down to what is bodhicata, it's compassion.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 Compassion for all living beings without any disconnections, without any partialities.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 That genuine compassion arises from the heart.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 Heart, that is the very, very cause of the enlightenment.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 That is the very cause of zoki-realization.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 Zoki-realization is the enlightenment.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.600
 Realization that we need to accommodate the merit, and we build up that realization.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 So compassion is really in the teaching, so many times, it's so special and so powerful.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.600
 Also, why is it so special?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.600
 Because compassion is the very nature of our own mind.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:06.600
 Nature of our own mind, the Buddha-nature, Buddha Dattang Dattang Garbha, we've heard so many times

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.600
.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 What is Dattang Dattang Garbha? Enlightenment nature.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.600
 That is compassion. That is wisdom.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 United Compassion, wisdom, targeted, is Dattang Dattang Garbha.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 That is inherent qualities to all the living beings.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.600
 Whatever we go through, different things, different karmas in our lives.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 But that quality is never lost. Never go away. It's here.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:44.600
 We came with that, we stay with that, and we live this world with that nature.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.600
 For that reason, great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said, and I said many times,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 and our great teacher, K.G. Pali, also walking, said that,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 whether Buddha came to this world, gave the teaching, that quality never improved.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.600
 Nothing improved.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 And Buddha does not come to this world and does not give any teaching.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 That does not disqualify anything.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.600
 Nature remains as it is.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 But that remains as it is not enough for us.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.600
 We have to discover. We have to explore.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.600
 Why we need to explore? Because of due to the duality, due to the habit event,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.600
 that we find out and go over that as a thick cloth, thick cloth.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600
 Life after life, life after life.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 Our love, our compassion, our wisdom is very limited.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 Why? This is governed by the habit event, dualities.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 Otherwise, our love and compassion, our wisdom, is totally vastness,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 vast and spacious as the sky.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 For that reason, the great Master, the original, said,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.600
 when you break that, I mean, he used the example many of you know.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 You know, if you put the example in the lamp,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 the pole that has a lamp inside, so you don't see the light from the pole.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 You see only the pole.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 But if you make a hole to that pole, you see the light.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.600
 You see, if you put two holes, we will see two lights.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.600
 If we put three holes, we will see three lights.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 And then he said, if you break that light,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 book the verse, V-A-S-E verse,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 that light completely expelled throughout the space,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 or beyond the space.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 That's the great teacher,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 Buddha Chagamani and Gaurupayama Sammam.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 That light is compassion.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 That light is wisdom.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 That is what that light is.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 When we practice toga meditation,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 zoki toga meditation,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.600
 that light, that is what we are exploring.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.600
 That's discovery.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.600
 That nature, realization on the regions of toga

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 is not just created by conception externally.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 It's a rising quality of nature.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 Deep is hiding behind the dualities.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 In the teaching of ocean measurement, youthful ways, bodies.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 What is youthful?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 Youth, that means is never getting old or dead or in it,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.600
 always remain fresh, young, energetic and brilliant.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 That is Buddha nature.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 That is primordial wisdom, that which is inside it.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.600
 And then that youth is where?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 It's vast, again, similar as Nagarjuna.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.600
 You use the example, vast, V-A-S-E, vast.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 But when you break that through the checkness of the zoki meditations,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 then we discover that the youthful freshness of the old in life ecologist.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 So therefore, again, the bodhicata,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 back to again, the bodhicata is always in the teaching sense,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.600
 that whatever you do, whether we are sitting,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 whether we are walking, whether we are sleeping,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 and we have the compassion and bodhicata taught in our heart and mind.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 Now all, what the gracious teacher, Buddha, Shikham, said,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 all the Buddha's teachings are came to your palms.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 Everything is not far in the distance.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.600
 Everything really comes after all.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 So this bodhicata and the compassion, the essence of the compassion,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.600
 is the essence of the bodhicata's compassion.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 And bodhicata is more activated, that compassion.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 And what in the teaching sense, by the compassion,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.600
 you are all projecting all the beings.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.600
 Where are we going to target that compassion?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 To all the beings of the six realms, they all have troubles.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.600
 As long as we have the emotion, karma,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 as long as we have the karma, that long we have troubles and difficulties.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 Troubles, all the beings.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.600
 So compassion is projecting all the beings of six realms.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 And our wisdom is projecting to get enlightenment, making more wise.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.600
 So in order to perform the reaches of the bodhicata, we need more wisdom.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:48.600
 Therefore, bodhicata is a union of the compassion and the wisdom together,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.600
 which is known as bodhicata.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 And what sometimes in the teaching sense, the cause,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 you are projecting by compassion all the beings,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.600
 which is a cause to get enlightenment.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.600
 And then, through the wisdom, you are projecting to the result of the enlightenment.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.600
 I'm going to get enlightenment, I get achievement and fulfillment,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 and then I'm going to help to all the beings.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.600
 Not just only the reading for the anti-irritous enlightenment,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.600
 but that from now, according to our capabilities,

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 helping to support and treat the beings with the genuine, compared thought.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.600
 Thought, that is really known as bodhicata.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.600
 So even when we do practice meditation, whatever we do,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.600
 if we have always bodhicata thought, then I ask gracious teacher,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 Buddha said, "All the teachings that came into your forms, not power."

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 And you're keeping, holding up so perfectly all the teachings.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.600
 Those are the teachings.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.600
 And with that understanding, and then, and the doki teaching.
