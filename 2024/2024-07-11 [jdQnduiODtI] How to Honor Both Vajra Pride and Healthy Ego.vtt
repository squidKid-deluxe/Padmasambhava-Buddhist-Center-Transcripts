00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.480
 Thank you. Following up on what you just talked about, in terms of Vajra pride, would you teach a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.560
 little bit about Vajra pride, as well as, oftentimes, there's a lot of emphasis on developing a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.620
 healthy sense of self, like, these are my talents, these are my limits, I like hot food, I'm from

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.980
 this place, there's kind of a healthy sense of me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.280
 So there's kind of an emphasis on how do we care for, like, a healthy me, and at the same time,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.670
 really have Vajra pride, like, I am the deity, and just, like, we were just teaching. How do we do

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.000
 both?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.800
 I think, I mean, of course, both are according to the Buddha's teaching, is relative. Relative

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.120
 truth, relative truth, and relative truth, and absolute truth, there's true truth. But within the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.000
 relative truth, there is also truth, truth. One is more purely connected, relative truth.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.960
 And one is just mundane, only the functional truth. Functional truth, even though they are not

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.980
 really existing in reality, that can shift, that can change, change as time grows, as our mind

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.000
 grows, so that can change upon that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.860
 So it's, like, more relative, like, functioning, communist, or mundane, relative truth. But the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:50.960
 relative truth of the pure relative truth, also known as the pure, yeah, pure relative truth, as it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.330
 is, or as it's there, what we're talking now, according to Buddhism, what we're talking now,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.000
 everything is a deity,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.930
 mantra, and the rest of the mind, that is relative truth, relative truth, but that's not going to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:18.620
 change. It will be as it is. As your realization grows, our wisdom grows, expanding, become more

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 clay, and more clay, and more clay, that's really not going to change.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.640
 So that is known as relative truth, such as realization, and the display of the Buddha's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.940
 realization. Buddha sees that everything is in enlightened state. Buddha sees everything is in the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.010
 previous qualities, and the Buddha sees all the forms are all enlightened, as I'm directly talking,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.000
 that is according to teaching, that's never going to change.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.390
 You will see at its is, and that's called violent, violent understanding, and sambhokaya

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.870
 realization, understanding, so that really no one can change. But what do you, what will be that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.780
 nature, what Buddha sees in nature is not something solid, indestructible, unchangeable, that this

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
 is not, it's a sambhokaya display, all that realization displays,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.390
 also like magical display, illusion, magical display of the wisdom, but it will be as it is. And

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.000
 then our day-to-day mind and thought, and what things needed, good, these things, and of course it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 has also common groundness, which is good, which is something more practical, more healthy, more

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.000
 simple, more aligned with the nature.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.670
 I think those are definitely very special, and I think very, very good, and I think that can be

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.870
 changed. I don't want to say we will stay forever, and for example, even the diet of the medicine,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.000
 the diet of food, they're explaining so many times, they said, three, four, five years ago, maybe

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 something is really good, everyone said the doctors recommended all that, and now they say maybe it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.000
's not exactly good.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.320
 Maybe it's not exactly good, or they shouldn't, this and that, they're changing that, but however,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.000
 it's trying to improve that, that's the common, because we all have, we don't know exactly clearly,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.370
 our presumption, and trying to accurately, that is not always complex, do the best to that, so that

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.000
 is, I think, common thing.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.900
 And the regular pride is, this is what we're talking, this 3D is poem, and song, and the mind that

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.660
 are in the enlightened states. That is reality, according to Buddhism, Buddha teaching, reality

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 callers, reality nature, it's true, we are, the Buddha nature is totally enlightened, totally

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.000
 enlightened, it has all the good callers.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.440
 And when we visualize as a deity, and when we see that our area as pure land, see, it's not just,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.000
 of course, it looks like imagination, but reality is really, as it is true.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.400
 So when we really have that kind of realization, when we get the realization, when we have that

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:36.000
 confidence, confidence, and as Buddha taught, and then, that is really regular pride.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:06:03.220
 I pose number, I'm the Vedic light, I'm the Vedic light, we know we want to realize that deity, and

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.340
 we have that confidence, is the Vedic light, confident, and we don't have the realization of the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.480
 Vedic light, that means that our visualization, the confidence is shaking, when we don't have the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.000
 confidence, that means the deep zone is the hesitation, or the doubt.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.390
 And that is obstacle, according. So when you have the confidence, the reality nature of our Buddha,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:22.260
 our nature of the mind, it really is, is in that waking state, it's truly, so now, we're not caught

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.000
 in the mundane world, or kind of carry the force of duality, but we return back to the origin state

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 of our own,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.030
 nature of the mind, or the tatagatagarbha, and see ourselves as the Vedic light, or the Buddha, and

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:47.850
 remain that confidence, that is known as the regular pride, or that is, that if we don't have that

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.000
 confidence, then the realization is shaky, even though the meditation is shaky, so therefore, have

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 confidence is really important, and that is regular pride.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Thank you, everyone.
