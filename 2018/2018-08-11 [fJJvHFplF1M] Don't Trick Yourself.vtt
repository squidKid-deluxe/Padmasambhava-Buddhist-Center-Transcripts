00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200
 "Even though we recognize, we may behold the glimpse of the nature of the Dharmakaya of our own

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 mind, our own nature. That is not enough. Now, what is it? That is called we have to meditate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.520
 Meditation is one of practice. Practicing in that way is "Gom". "Gom" means, in the teaching, "Gom

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:37.000
 ba mai Gom ba hai" means meditation is nothing but making more familiarness. More familiarness.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 That is what it is. Meditation is more familiar with the nature of my own nature.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.030
 Now, we glimpse our understanding through the kindness, teaching, the techniques, the skillful

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 means of the techniques of Dzogchen teaching. We kind of glimpse that. But our realization is not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 stable.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.940
 Because duality is massive. Grasping is strong. And the ignorance of the grasping is thick and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.000
 heavy. Through the power of teaching of the Dzogchen, we glimpse and experience it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.670
 But it soon can be blurred by, again, all those reasons or conditions. Therefore, we have to be

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.000
 continually carrying all these and meditate at practices, practices, practices.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.660
 And that is again, here again, teaching says clearly, all that is pleasant. This is not going away

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.000
 immediately. These dualities.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.620
 And when we develop these dualities, according to the teaching, from the beginning less times, from

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.000
 the beginning less times, we develop that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.310
 We mishandle it. We mishandle it. So therefore, we have to do continually with practices. We have

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 to do continually with practices.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.490
 How we practice this? Really, exactly, I put the frame of the day by again, at the light of the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:29.000
 great Massa Japukumra. Those eight different frames, we should practice this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.310
 Practice with the basic foundation practices of the Buddha teaching, those Mundra practices. This

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.000
 is the important essence embodiment of the entire Buddha teaching.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 Day one is teaching, and tell the very other teaching all for that. In other words, the entirely

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 condensed teaching of the Nain Jana teaching, known as the Mundra practices, foundation practices.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.210
 Steady feeling on that, we like to really explore our triggers. Have to be more practical, more

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.000
 simple, and more down to the ground.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.990
 Not looking always at emergency exits. Or not looking always like parachutes somewhere. That's not

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.000
 the way. There is no way that we can do.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.760
 It's just tricking our own self. We trick our self from the biggest times, thinking we are doing

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 something best.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.990
 According to the Buddha teaching, we trick our own self. We really bounce our head again and again,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.000
 all the time.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.960
 Again, when we come to the spiritual light together, the solution of something, like to change our

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.000
 direction, and the life starts.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.610
 Again, bring the same old habit, like to feel the easy ways. Easy way, communist way, emergency, or

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.000
 shortcut, or whatever we use next.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.240
 There is no way. This is what the Dzogchen teaching is shortcut. There is nothing higher, better,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.000
 safer, more simple, more rarely shortcut than the Dzogchen teaching.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.350
 That was renowned by all the practitioners from the time of the Buddha taught this teaching until

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.000
 now.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.590
 Now. So therefore, feel the great joy in the application of strong reward and prayer, and really

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.000
 this, they absorb this teaching to the heart.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.060
 Heart and practice follow the footsteps of all these ancient great practitioners, great masters,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.000
 what we call, but they are great practitioners.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 They are great, beautiful, humble, simple, very human, and very, very humility. Really, they are.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.480
 When you look down or read the books of their life stories, how they are full of love, full of

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:57.000
 compassion, full of kindness, full of gentle, peaceful, humble, respectful, appreciative.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.660
 All that good things, what we name in the book, everything they encourage, encourage, commitment,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.000
 digital emergence, and simple, and always very content.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.480
 Really, they are so beautiful. When you think these, these, these, they are just marvelous,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.000
 beautiful, more than beautiful.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 That's how in this great follow that footstep.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.300
 And we like to discover exactly what the great master, whom he discovered, or the human, who

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.820
 discovered, or the part of whom discovered, or his or her, who discovered, covered, or the Buddha

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.000
 Shakyamna, who discovered.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And we like to do. Do. That's this the way. Practice those. Those.
