NOTE     "synopsis": "An introduction to Palden Sherab Pema Ling, Lotus Land of Glorious Wisdom, a Buddhist retreat center being built in South Florida.\n\nPalden Sherab Pema Ling is located on ten-acres of land that includes a pond, numerous trees, fields, and wetlands that are enjoyed by abundant local wildlife.\n\nWe\u2019ve already begun construction of the main meditation temple. The horse barns are being converted into a temple, meditation sanctuary, and fellowship hall, and the land will be preserved as a park-like setting for contemplative walks, meditation, or simply sitting in quiet reflection.\n\nThe Palm Beach Dharma Center\u2014a local branch of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\u2014is looking for funding to create this beautiful sanctuary. It will be a place for spiritual rejuvenation to promote natural beauty where outer peace and harmony, foster inner healing and tranquility.\n\nIts namesake is Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, one of the great Tibetan Buddhist masters and scholars of the 20th century. He and his brother, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, long dreamed of creating a Buddhist retreat center in South Florida. With the help of your kindness and generosity, this dream could now become a reality.\n\nDonate here:\nwww.gofundme.com/f/develop-dharma-center-in-jupiter-fl\n\nPlease visit the Palm Beach Dharma Center website for more details:\nwww.pbdc.net/palden-sherab-pema-ling-retreat-center\n\nThe International website of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center:\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.480
 The

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.900
 Kempo Rinpochets had dreamed for years of creating a retreat center in the beautiful Florida

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.680
 countryside,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.560
 a place where Buddhists and others could engage in tranquil reflection, deep meditation,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:44.000
 and authentic retreat. That dream began to be a reality in 2014, when we found the land that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.960
 would become Palden Sherab Pema Ling, lotus land of glorious wisdom, named after Ven. Khenchen

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 Palden Sherab Rinpoche, who passed into Maha Parindirvana in 2010. A little over 10 acres with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.520
 a cypress grove, three pole barns and a house, and hundreds of trees, Ven. Khenchen Palden

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 Sherab Rinpoche saw what it could become. After careful planning and preparation,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.600
 we worked together to transform the property, tending to the cypress grove, planting hundreds

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.760
 of new trees and shrubs, and creating a beautiful Buddha garden. Then we turned our attention to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.840
 the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 central barn, converting it into a Buddhist temple, opening up the interior space, bringing in

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.440
 natural

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:55.120
 light, and enclosing the exterior to define the sacred space. We plan to unveil this beautiful

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.920
 temple in early 2020, offering a new and unique home for the Buddha Dharma here in South Florida.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.440
 We welcome you to join us on this journey and to contribute to our efforts in whatever way

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.080
 feels best for you. We hope that you will join us in celebrating the endless compassion

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.040
 and loving-kindness of the Buddha.
