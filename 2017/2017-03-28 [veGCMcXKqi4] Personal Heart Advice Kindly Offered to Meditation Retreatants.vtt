00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.630
 I'm going to encourage everyone practicing meditating on the Te Choo practices. Te Choo is so

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.520
 important.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:31.120
 What in the teaching said, "If we don't have the stable of the Te Choo, the Togal won't break the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 lip of the Togal. Therefore, the Te Choo is so important."

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:56.720
 The two meditations are whenever the Togal, where the Te Choo will start with joy and appreciation.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.120
 As I said many times, and you know, you all know we need this. We need joy and appreciation.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.000
 And such a meeting, such a great teaching that we have opportunity to practice this, and a meeting

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 to the Buddha teaching, is not just co-accident, according to the Buddha teaching, is very, very

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.120
 important. Really, promote joy and appreciation.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.040
 We are soaked with the great teachings. Prominent great masters, one approach. How fortunate we are

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.120
. Really, we are soaked. We're not just one, it's a small teaching. We have so many great teachings.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 Teachings. How fortunate it is. Now is our time. We have to make that, bring some result from that.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 We have to do.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.250
 Teachings alone are not true. That's what Buddha says to you. "I show you the path. I show you the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.940
 path. But now it is up to you." Buddha said. It's true. Buddha gave the teaching. Buddha gave the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.120
 early techniques.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 When we come to the practice, we have to put practice. If Buddha practice, that won't work to us.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.890
 Buddha written like already. Of course, Buddha gave the teaching. We got the teaching. But this, we

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.120
 don't get enlightened because Buddha written like.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 We have to do our share. Our share is put that in the practices. We have to do it. When we come to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.120
 practice, how we start? With joy, with appreciation.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 How fortunate we are. How grateful we are. How graceful. Being graceful. We really should do that.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.900
 With that, then also we have great bodhicam. Longing kindness compared to your thought. Think of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.510
 this world, how many difficult tablas are going. Within this country, this is one of the great

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.120
 countries.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.720
 Also, how many things difficult tablas are going. And outside of the world or this country, how

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.120
 many difficult tablas are going on.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.120
 This is just only on the world, human level. How many beings are suffering? Really.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.690
 We really think that. And what we are doing is, there really is benefit to all good beings. Put our

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.180
 mind, put our body together, our intention. Let that ripple effort to all the living beings. Really

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.120
 wish that.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 That's what those great masters teach. All those great beings.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.540
 That's how we can make the difference. Make change. Make a difference to the others. We can make a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.120
 difference. That is our practices.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:47.070
 So increase the bodhicam. Then the devotions. Bring the devotions. Join the devotions. Life is very

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.120
 precious. It's not going to stay forever. That we know.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 And then also, situation and circumstances are all in the right time. They're not going to let us.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.120
 We should play right in our time. And particularly this time, you all met a great kind of element,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.120
 a great organizer in your life and come here for about a month.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.490
 I mean this is how really my son feels that I did good. I did practice good. That's what we plan to

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:31.220
 do. Kind of feel that. That's all. With that, then we do this with devotional practices at the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 beginning times.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.660
 And of course you did group practice, we do target all that. But if you're alone, when you're

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.120
 practicing alone, bring on your devotion, devotion, praise, this praise. All those are the words.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.200
 I'm going to play some words with great masters. As he said, it's not something that we wrote or I

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.120
 wrote. It is really the words authentic, blessed words of the great master.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.370
 Read that. Join that. Make that as your own world. Make that meaning, apply that meaning to the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:13.110
 heart. Receive blessings. Feel strong presence. May I actually the realization of this life time,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.120
 as you great master did, please bless me that.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:25.090
 I can't make that urge. And then started only meditating. Meditating that I will say, what we have

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.120
 to do, even though zuki meditation, our mind have to be stable.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.920
 Even if mind is not stable, zuki meditation is not happening. That means our conception is carrying

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.120
 our thought and we are following up with that thought. That is called unstable.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.320
 During meditation our physical is kind of stable, sitting. But our thought and conception are

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:04.270
 following up with thought, chasing up with thought. That thought is what in the teaching said, dual

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.120
ity.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:15.600
 What that duality is, that is very rude, very cause of samsara. That's called samsara. We were

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:24.990
 wondering samsara. Zoki is beyond samsara. Zoki is beyond nirvana. We are not beyond. We are within

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.120
 the territory.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.280
 We have to stay with thought. To make stable thought, maybe even if needed, do shamata meditation

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:42.580
 for few seconds or few minutes. Make stable. And shamata has to, I mean you know all this. You all

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.120
 know.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:54.760
 Shamata has to focus shamata, un-focus shamata. I will say, shamata with focus, use some object,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:02.120
 some imagination things and focus on that. Not let mind go out of that force.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:13.340
 So that will maybe help, not maybe it will help. Anchor down our mind. Anchor down our mind. Un

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.120
stable mind. Mind.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:35.350
 Then do the zokki meditation. One is mind step. One is zokki meditation. And even zokki meditation

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.120
 is relaxing on the natural state of your own mind. Not doing anything.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:45.740
 But that's what always zokki teaching says. Effortless. Free from the effort. Effort is a

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:54.120
 conception. Effort is that means samsara. Zokki is out of the samsara.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:06.120
 Samsara, zokki is out of the nirvana. Zokki is natural. Natural. Relaxing in a natural state.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.120
 Therefore many times they say, nothing to do. Relax.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:25.130
 Calm. Peaceful. Relax. Relax. Not forceful. Relax. And to do this, what in the teaching said always

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:34.090
, look to your mind. Who is going to look to your mind? Your mind or our mind, my mind is going to

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.120
 look to my mind.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:50.960
 We are going to viewing the viewer. We are going to viewing the viewer. When you are viewing the

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:59.120
 viewer, when you are looking to the looker, the subject and object are merged.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:10.690
 There is no subject and object. It is blended in. And you are relaxing in that state. Relax in that

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:19.120
 state. Relaxing in open vastness. Relax in that state.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.060
 And where you are relaxing that, able to relax that. And occasionally, if you continue to stay in

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.470
 that state, it is quite good. Occasionally, even if you are meditating strongly, bring more dev

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.120
otions.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.520
 Feel strong presence of the great master, Murugan Maasamma, or his only Dhanuran. Really bring up

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:46.120
 that joy and feel how great as transcendental was to the rainbow body. Feel their blessing power.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:54.120
 And just for a few moments, again let that absorb. Let that dissolve back to where it came from.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:05.120
 Again, continue to relax in that natural state. Natural state. Continue to relax, expand.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:16.120
 In the Zogji teaching, what I will always say. Open, again, keep relaxing naturally. Everything.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:23.120
 All the senses are naturals. That means we are not changing anything about our senses.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:33.270
 Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or anything. Relaxing calmly, peacefully, and nothing changes. And

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.960
 for those reasons, also in the teachings of the teachings said, "App is not too disturbance or not

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.120
 too difficult." Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:54.590
 And also in the teachings said, "Let breathing come from the mouth." Slightly open the mouth. More,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:02.120
 let it naturally come from the mouth.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:10.490
 And nostrils are the normal passage of the breathing. In the teachings said, "It's the passage of

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:21.270
 the karma, the karmic wind. But if you reverse that, it naturally subside the karmic wind, force,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:30.090
 and allowing the western wind that will connect to the heart center." Heart, and it will bring more

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.120
 clarity.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:42.590
 So, "F" is not too disturbance or not too difficult. Open the eyes. Slightly open the mouth. More,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:50.120
 let breathing come. Even the may come, let it be on the mouth.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:12:01.680
 Not again forceful or uncomfortable. Then, continue to relax. We are able to do that. We are able

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.120
 to relax in that nature. We are very relaxing.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.340
 We are relaxing in our own, old, natural of the Buddha, some of the Buddha, as I said before, sub-

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:17.870
evident, some of the Buddha states. You are relaxing that state. You are relaxing, or we are

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.120
 relaxing in dharmakaya states. That is dharmakaya.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.380
 For that reason, great Muslim, his whole duality, in his modern literature, what he said, "How

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.120
 fortunate we are, as thankful we can revel our own dharmakaya right now."

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:41.930
 He didn't teach and said, "That is what I am really teaching." He said, "Relax in that." And then,

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:49.120
 concluding with again, with full of devotion, graceful devotion and delicately merit.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:57.880
 Merit. Okay, so that is my brief talk for today, and then I think we will stop here, but we will

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.120
 answer the questions of the hour tomorrow.
