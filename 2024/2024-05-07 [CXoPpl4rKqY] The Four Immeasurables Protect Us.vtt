00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Again, thank you so much everyone for participating. Thank you. Again, we continue now with the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.000
 teaching.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 We will be teaching following the light of the all the great masters, such as the great masters,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Rabdolje, all the way until now, all of the great masters.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And then we will also highlight and follow the great masters.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 People and the reluctant beings, the fact that all of these teachings, as well as the addition with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 all the great masters,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 they are teaching with the joy of what I want. I can digest them in my mind.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Mind and thought is so benefited to all of ourselves.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 So we are trying to let them more activate it, learn this teaching.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I like to follow this teaching with this power.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I'm a little bit understandable, different kind of all that we had.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Cheating together and put together and as to present as well.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 But I've been doing again this way.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.400
 Today, again, we continue, we strengthen our little motivation of the joy and appreciation and that

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.000
.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 So with that, and we also activated our body and the thought.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 So they will be sensory from heart and the grip.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 With the Paul, the Paul in measure of thought.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Not just a once in a while giant, but really truly mean that from heart.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Start with the Paul in measure of thought.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 That is so powerful, so touched to the heart.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 All of the Buddha's teachings, teaching and all of our own true nature.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Teaching is Paul in measure, really wishing that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 This, that is, we can do.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 That is not something we have to say, oh, I don't know if the cup of light is this or that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 In the mental state, the mind is very eager to do anything that we like to do.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 We can thank, we can this thing, the motivation, thinking for all living beings.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.460
 All living beings, may they all have happiness, may you owe it peace, call of happiness, may you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.000
 all know.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 That is about really so powerful, so special.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 In the Buddha teaching in measure, as well as also great master in measure,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 if you have really genuine those thoughts in your heart and mind,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 it really put a fight, obstacles, hedders.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.270
 It was protected from the, oh, not the kind of, if we think that there is some, is with the ways of

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.000
 hurting or doing something.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 If we have that, that Paul in measure of things, it will protect us.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 That it will become protection.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Because they see, they feel your power, love and compassion.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 They think, we are not aliens.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 We are, we like to copy your, every living beings.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Whether we see or whether we don't see, it's really sincere.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 That for one minute, or two minutes, three minutes, everything, that is tremendous power.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Power will accumulate the merit, and as well as remove obscurations and the progression.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.460
 That is, this bodhika, there is love, immediately love and compassion is so special in human

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.000
 movement.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 When we talk about the bodhika, the love and compassion, it has no boundaries.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 No limitations.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 That we call is the bodhika, the love.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 It's not just a regular love.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Regular love is best on that, but love for all beings.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 All living beings wishing that.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And all wishing, everyone is free from suffering, cause of suffering.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 That compassion, no boundaries.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 That's what is bodhika.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 That's what also is named, Immanuel.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 It's Immanuel.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Many ways, all Immanuel.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.320
 So brain of those, those beautiful motivations, the intentions, the input shot for moments is so

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.000
 powerful.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And that is very foundation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Our whole practice of meditation is, really the practice is to improve that, that one.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Improve the loving kindness, improve the compassion.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Improve the joy and appreciation.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Improve the equanimity of the realization, the understanding of true nature.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Dzogchen or Mahamudara or the Kanyaparamas.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Equanimity, that is what really we started from there.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And that is what the really practice is.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So that when we have those beautiful attitudes and beautiful thoughts in the heart and mind,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 whatever you can, that person, that person is really beautiful, become special.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 They are the peacemakers, truly peacemakers.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Makers, locally peacemaker and brain of peace, according to the energy.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And we combine them with the blessings of the Buddha and Buddhism, our intelligence,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 it become enormous.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 It become the ripple effect.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 It goes far where we can even imagine.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Go all the sentences by the blessings of the Buddhas.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And Gaurabhima, some of them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And Bodhisattva or Manjushri.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And Bodhisattva and Tijin said, summon the Buddhas.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Their expression, praise, their inclination to benefit all living beings is immeasurable.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Even the Buddha, the great teacher of Buddha, appreciated them

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 and glorified them with their attitude, with their intention.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Taking all the sentient beings with that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 So we join, kind of, use that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Our meditation, our prayers, joined with that, kind of,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 use as suffering bow and then swing to the old galaxy of the universe

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 and all the beings with sex lands.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And attaching to every single living being.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Free from suffering and difficulty of trouble.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And reward their energy and nature.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 From the gold and the deep of their heart.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Nature of love, joy, and peace.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And the Buddha nature.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 That is.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And there were those beautiful motivations.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And then we did the Vajayana motivation or realization.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Three kayak status.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 So those all are our practices.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Not just the motivation, thinking your thing,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 and then kind of, we skipped someone else.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Really, those are the principles of practice and meditation.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 The Dzoghi teaching, in what we practice,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 is to discover, incidentally, three kayak status.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That really is what Dzoghi teaching is.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Discover any three kayak status,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 both externally and internally.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Or internally, externally.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 That is what Dzoghi teaching is.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 So, have those beautiful motivations.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And then, so now, in Dzoghi teaching, as you all know,
