00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580
 It is then again reactivating, reactivating of the teaching, of the old teaching of the five parts.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.580
 More condense level, condense level, and more as secret mantra level. This is again what is known.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.000
 Skilful means, Buddhist teaching generally all is best upon skilful means and compassion.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 So by the compassion, again summarizing entirely the Heart Sutra teaching into these mantras.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.040
 And so that is now, what is this? The following mantra.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 Mantra, therefore, now goes again to summarize of this teaching and practices more and that will

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 immediately benefit and help it to cleanse and purify

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 and then should we see this following. So this following mantra is the mantra of the Pandya Paramat

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.000
as, mantra of the Pandya Paramatas.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And again, mantra is in the Sanskrit word and it has two meanings, man and ataras.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Man is in the Sanskrit word, means mind. And ataras means protected.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 So protector of the mind, that means protector. And what is protecting?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It's protecting from the negative emotions, wrongdoing of the mind.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 Mind is a fundamental source to do anything. So this protecting from the negativity, activity, and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.000
 all habitivity and bring the mind toward its own origin and nature.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 And then, therefore, it's called mantra. And this mantra is the great awareness mantra.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 And this is also, that meaning is absolute mantras. It is not just a mantra, but it's one's own

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.000
 awareness, one's own Pandya Paramata.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Nature is reflected in the form of this mantra or form of this syllabus.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.860
 So, also awareness means there is no ignorance. So this is the mantra of the verses. Man is not an

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.000
 inner mantra.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.900
 It brings up our realization, understanding, wisdom, dispel, darkness of ignorance. Darkness of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.000
 ignorance.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.350
 Since this is the mantra of the awareness of the wisdom, then there is nothing more matter, better

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.000
 matter than this.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.600
 This is the best mantra that will protect us from the wrongdoing of the mind, or it will protect us

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 from the emotional obscurations and the knowledge obscurations.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 So, therefore, it is, nothing is higher and better matter than this.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And the mantra that equalize what is not equals, that means it will purify all the dualities.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.450
 Duality is the unequal. It makes a bump. But when you release the duality, then everything becomes

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.000
 equal with ordinary natural states.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 The ordinary natural state of exaggerating is at both the relative level and the absolute level.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So, this will bring that realization, unequal, that which is equal.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.800
 Because of that, this practice, if we continue practicing, even if we didn't reach that realization

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.000
, it will pacify all the sufferings.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.610
 And the mantra totally pacifies all the sufferings. So, it will purify all sufferings, all the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.000
 difficult troubles those will purify.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Because of this mantra, it is the mantra of the wisdom. This mantra is then called Pandya Paramata.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.180
 And that is the cause of the, it will clear away the cause of those sufferings and call suffering

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.000
 itself.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And why it is? Because it is truth. It is an expression of the truth. It is exactly where it is.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.760
 Therefore, it is so powerful, so special, so forceful to clear away all the unnatural, think in

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.000
 natural habit appearance.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And that is what the religious, this mantra should be seen as that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And it should be known as to, I am sure, known as well.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.040
 And what is that Pandya Paramatra? Mantra is then Pandya Paramantra is uttered here or said here,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.000
 that is.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And that is the yata of gati, yati, para, gati, para, san, gati, body, source, that is source.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And now, this, so what is it?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 But the other is, we translated this again, translated this, that the other is das, das.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 I think that is what many times translated das.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Das, om is prosperity and peace, acupicius, glorious, all that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And then gati is go.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And gati is go, very go, para san, very, very beautiful go.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And then bodhi, enlightenment, soha is astellish, astellish.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 So that is the brief meaning of this.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.970
 Now, what means here, again, go, go, I mean in other words, go, go, go, very go, par go and very

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.000
 fully go.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Where to go? Go to the body, go to the body.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 That is really the basic meaning.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.840
 So now, to understand this is our, again, we looked in other world, what Buddha gives the teachings

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.000
,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 the first teaching of the Buddha in Varanasu, four noble truth teachings.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And those are known as suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, part truth, and cessation truth.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.320
 So this is, it openly is saying the part truth and cessation truth, openly explaining or is, so

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.000
 that means it is essence of that teachings.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 It directly saying then suffering truth and cause of suffering truth.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 So that means why is that?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 That means where we are now, for example, where we are now, so where we, why we have to go now?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Why we have to go?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 This prison moment, us in the suffering truth and cause of suffering truth, that's what we are.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 We are staying.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 In another world, we are suffering truth status, I call it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Suffering truth is what?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Is this world, this samsara is suffering truth, according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 It is suffering truth.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And then what kind of suffering, the difficulty challenges we have?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 All things that we can really name into ourselves, parts and the levels.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 What do we have troubles? You think? All those are known as suffering, suffering truth.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Why is it called truth?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.770
 Truth, even though it's all illusions, but even though it's illusion, we are going through that

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.000
 experiences.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 It's not uncomfortable.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 When we experience that, it's not comfortable.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 It's true.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 True is not just a making up, it's true uncomfortable.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Therefore, it's called suffering truth.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 In another world, challenging truths, all difficult truths, and uneasy truths.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 We can use all those words.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 In samsara, we have that.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 At the mental level, psychological level, physical level, we have that.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 It's all uncomfortable, always something.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And then plus, what the teaching says, that you know this goal underneath troubles.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 That whole difficulty troubles, all the challenges have summarized, three things summarize.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Those are known as all pervasive uncomfortables.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 We will say uncomfortable. Then the second is changeable uncomfortable, uncomfortable challenges.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And then, third one is challenging upper challenges.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 All in the teaching, also sometimes we use suffering upper sufferings.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Those are naturally phenomena occurring that we all have to go through, or we are.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Among that, the fourth is pervasive, uncomfortable challenge.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 That in the teaching said, as long as we have the physical, as long as we have the duality mind,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 we are tended to have challenges.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 That is easy to erupt immediately, something to come up.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Because of that condition, the circumstances are hiding there,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 but otherwise, maybe there is always a challenge that can come up.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Because of that, then changeable challenges come.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Changeable challenges come.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 One after, maybe not having, now it's going good, everything, and suddenly something came up.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Come, all gradually come up, whatever it is.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 It's called changeable challenges.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Then challenging upper challenges, because of that pervasive undercurrent in that situation,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 then many times it happens one after another, repeatedly, one after another.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 That means just very soon from each other, each other, that happens.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Those are all known as challenge, like suffering truths.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 All this is difficult, trouble and challenge, one after another. So that is called samsara.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Samsara is full of challenges.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And then from this, we have to go.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 From this situation, we should go.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And what is the cause of those again?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 And of course, you all know.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 The cause is known as then, the cause of suffering truth.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 The cause of suffering truth, whatever we are going through, is not just coming by itself.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 It has cause, it has conditions.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 As we have been talking about the day, the day that everything started with the cause and condition

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.000
.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 The combination ignited that situation.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And the cause, the principal cause and condition are negative emotions.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Negative emotions.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And then it is action.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Negative emotion, it is action.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 It is a principal cause.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And those are negatives that started to work.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Again through the illness of mind.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Mind we went through in the teaching and in the new practice.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 We all practiced in some degree of the zouki. We know mind is empty.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 But even though mind is empty, yet all these things are propagated from mind.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 And negative emotion is not outside.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 It is all of our mental states.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And those are the ignorance, the attachment, the anger, and then doubt and all those things.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.820
 And self-report and self-breathing, all those started with kind of that boiling in our mind, mental

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.000
 state.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 When it is reflected and then in action, that is known as negative activities.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 That negative activity is also known as in Buddhism karma.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 That is karma.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So karmic, karmic and with that consequence.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 And then continually maintain these troubles.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And that is the cause of suffering truth.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 So now here in this teaching, what is teaching here?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 What is teaching here?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Say from this samsara, from cause of suffering truth and from suffering truth go to the path.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Go to the path.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Go to the five paths.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Go to the five paths.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 That is what is really teaching this is.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So first in gati, for example, gati is accumulation path.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Second in gati is application path.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Para san gati is seeing path.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So not san gati.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Para san gati is seeing path.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And para san gati is meditation path.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Bodhi is normal starting path, an enlightened state.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So that is what really teaching is.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Teaching is negative.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 And now we go here again.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 So that is the general meaning.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And again the great master Verojana,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 or the Kona teaching of the Kilesana in this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 These all others are really same.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 So that is why I really go here.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 It is all same because the absolute truth has no really difference

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 between bhayana and vedayana.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 All that as we were said this.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So you be at your own.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 [ Pause ]

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 And now here according to the vedayana teaching,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 this is again teaching of the Verojana,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 the great master Dax Vettel and Ed Vettel

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 and one of the nine hearted students of the European assembly

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 and the first order of the most,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 one of the first order of the most of Tibet.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Tibet and fully ordered the most of Tibet.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And then the great Dax later in the world called Verojana,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Verojana Rakchita because Verojana told the ordination

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 from the great master Shanda Rakchita.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 According to Vinaya tradition or the teaching,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 the one who received ordination from that master

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 always give the last name as their part of names.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 So Shanda Rakchita, Vosam Shanda Rakchita is the last name

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 and therefore Verojana Rakchita, Kawapati Rakchita

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and Joro Yancey Rakchita.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 All those 25 disciples, all those really open that you see.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 So Rakchita, Rakchita.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 So this is Verojana Rakchita.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 He's one of the first monks in Tibet.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Verojana Rakchita says that in Buddhism that was concerned,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 attributed to have the capability to keep up these vows,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 vows and how that will be, if they can keep or not, Vinaya vows.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 So for that reason, first they decided to test with seven men,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 seven men or seven young men.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 So they taught this way, Shanda Rakchita, and become the order in the master,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 the principal master.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 And then many other monks also invited from India

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 and gave the first ordination.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 So Verojana is one of the first one and Verojana Rakchita.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Then later Verojana started under the guidance

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 of Shanda Rakchita and Gaurabhema, some of the Sanskrit language.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 And then he was a genius.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And the teachings said also he was emanation of the Ananda.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Ananda, even though Swamiji said he is emanation of the Buddha Verojana.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Buddha Verojana.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 But either way, he is one of the very brilliant and just a genius in that time.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 And he, in the teachings, said he knows 360 languages, 360 languages.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 And not just know those languages, but he knows the exact meaning

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 and vocabulary, exact as their own countries.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Brings the nose there.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 So he is the Kudasrezo, great master, Vasram Dapini.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 There is no vast network of welcome ever as of before and after like Verojana.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Verojana has such great knowledge.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 He particularly honored that much, honored to him.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And then when he was grown up in the 80s, 80s, 80s, 20s, then Kudasrezo and Dapini

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 and Gurbama Sambo, Chantalak generally suggested that he should send this young Tibetan to India

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 because also they thought that they were like, they thought that Chantalak

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.990
 to make the Buddha of his trusty, because the king won't have any kind of like doubt and hesitation

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000
.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 While Gurbama Sambo and Chantalak gave teaching, he is not authentic teaching of the Buddha.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Buddha to kind of correct that or to declare any those hesitations, what if they have or have,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 and then Chantalak told that the same, Verojana in India.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 India and Verojana stayed quite a while and then he able to meet the western body of the,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 of the, of the Hidisana and Garabdho ji Erezilago teachings.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So then he came back.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 So that Verojana become the first, also a royal teacher or root guru of the,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 one of the royal teacher or root guru of the characters of dating, really that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 So, so this is, that's it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 And then he bought Dzogki teachings,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.580
 particularly Dzogki teachings of the mind section and the space section of the Dzogki teaching to

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.000
 Tibet.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.460
 Tibet and therefore he is considering three great Dzogki masters of the, to be the Buddhism and the

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.000
 Nyingma.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 So Murpema Sambhava, Murmatra and Verojana, those things.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So that is what.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 So as he received this teaching, from this teaching, from Chirisana,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 and then he gave this teaching to Khay Chasson Dejis.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 This is.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And now to do this, so that is just a green color again.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 We have the, of the, of the.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And so this again, this mantra, explaining of these mantras.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Mantras, this is a mantra of the Pandya Paramata.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 When you practice of this mantra, what is your object?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So it is explaining object of, of your focal point, focal point.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 How to practice this?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 What will bring the result of these practices?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Practices.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 That is, that is explaining.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And the focal point of this practice of the Pandya Paramata Mantra,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 and again say way, both each other, thinking of all living beings.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Living beings and to benefit, to remove their suffering, difficulty.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 At the same time, according to the different levels of what is already explained,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 it is seeing everything as a perfect status.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 As like Sambukaya levels.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 With that, with that meditation, seeing all is in task, task, lucidity.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Task, lucidity status.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Everything as like emptiness.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 All forms of emptiness, that realization, task, lucidity status.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And join this, then this mantras.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 When you join these mantras, then what it will bring the result.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 It will bring the result quicker than any other method.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 It will cook the brain.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 That means it will bring cooked realization of the true natures.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And then, it's not just brain realization, that while also by this practice,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 it will turn samsara into pure land or the naranas.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Naranas.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 So therefore, this mantra is very, very powerful and spacious.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Spatials.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And also, this mantra is not, this realization and achievement

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 is not relying to the other techniques because it is all right with us.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Right with you.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 That awareness is with us.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 There is nothing higher than our own awareness, our own true awareness.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So this exploring, discovering our own true awareness.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 And also, when you join this, what will be done?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 You begin to see how rich in the scholars of the awareness contains.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 At a coded zoki level, then also the spontaneous and etheric, all qualities.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 That will shine out or that will bring out by these mantras.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 When you recite this mantra, then also it will bring,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 as it will bring all the richness of the awareness

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 and that will benefit to also something that is unequal, unequal benefits,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 unequal benefit to all the sentient beings, to everyone, equal sentient beings.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And this is the nature of your own mind, our own mind.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 We are exploring with discovery of this very nature of the, nature of one's own.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 And then, it says again, this is mantra of the Konyapaka parameter.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Mantra also means essence too, essence.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 What that means?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Essence of our own awareness, essence of our own true nature,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 which is, cannot be separated by any ways, any ways.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 So in another world, it's indestructible, indestructible,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 unpredictable, the nature of the awareness will be reworked.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 When you have that realization, you transcend that all the challenges

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 into great blessfulness or great peaceful status.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 When you recite this mantra, can I recite this mantra without any focal point

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 or without any grasping, cleaning, relaxing with this?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 So if you join that way, then you will see the benefit of this mantra.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Therefore, it is not untruth.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 It is a truth you were witnessed by yourself.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 You were witnessed by yourself.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And then, that mantra is explained by the great master.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 No, our lock, the shorts, our lock, the hip.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Taddiata is mid, taddiata and I translated, das, das.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Here I said, I mean, taddiata is intubated.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Dattati, dattati.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So that is in the yata translated as das, t-h-u-s, das.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 But here I said, das means both samsara and nirvana is same.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Das it is, means both samsara and nirvana are the same nature.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Nature, to bring up that realization and it says das it.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 And that also means here, I said, it is that when it is same,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 there is nothing to have to think, do this, do this.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 But nirvana and samsara are also inseparably same.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And also, unchangeably is same, unchangeable same.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 So that is the meaning of this das, t-h-u-s das.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Then here, this mantra starts of course.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Om, gati, gati, para, gati, para, sangati, bodhisu.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Om is a symbolized of the, when we don't have this realization perfectly,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Om symbolized as five poisons.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Five poisons are such as ignorance, many of you already know,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, arrogance.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Those are the five poisons.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Five poisons.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And then, when you realize the nature of the rupa, that awareness,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 when you realize it, this is then five dhyana buddhas.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Five dhyana buddhas or five male buddhas.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Buddhas, so that is what it is.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And at that level, also from Kiki, what they generally measured,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 and I saw that also in some other texts.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Om, you even write Om, I mean a little bit, I can't talk a little bit,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 that r, then o, and then this sankal.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 So there is only three words.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 But here we can imagine that Om should write,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 like most Om should write, all those mantra Om's write,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 like of course that r, narrow, and then same way in the Om,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 that moon shape, moon shape, and then there called,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 and underneath is r, r.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 So that it makes five syllables, and I saw that many texts,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 and here also mass, great mass.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 When we turn over here, I was explaining that.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 To symbolize that, so that Om has five parts, five parts, five parts.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 So that's what this is.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 So it is symbolized in samsara,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 when you don't have the realization of that,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 it is a five, symbolized, five forms.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 But when you realize of this nature, this is then five dhyana buddhas.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Buddhas.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Buddha.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And...

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 So that is really, so we understand this.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And now, so the next one is ghati.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Ghati is that when you have the realization of the awareness of the Pandya Paramata,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 when you realize it exactly, then what now, next one is ghati.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Ghati means, again I said, go.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Go beyond or go.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Go.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 So what that means?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 By the realization of this Pandya Paramata or the awareness,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 you go to fulfill your own benefits.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Fulfillment.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 In the Buddha's teaching,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 occasionally you heard, or many of you,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 fulfilling the two purposes, or dual purposes sometimes.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Fulfillment is one's own purposes,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 and then fulfilling the benefit to all the beings.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Means, those are really two purposes.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 One's own purpose, and that means,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 in order to benefit to all beings, you have to be strong,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 you have to be free from all the negative emotions,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 all those hinders.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 So then fully we are active and ready,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 and we can reach and benefit to the other beings.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 So therefore, first you should take care of yourself,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 and then to the others.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 That didn't mean we should not think of others.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 We are taking care of one's own self in a way,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 that thinking of to benefit to all beings,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 and start with both each other, same thing.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 But what it does, immediately,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 when we do the practice of thinking of all living beings,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 practice that immediately help to one's own self,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 cleansing and purify, obscurations, that immediate effort.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So that aspect is known as fulfilling the one's own purpose.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 So here, Gati, go first.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Go first, referring to fulfilling one's own purpose.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And the second Gati is fulfilling,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 now you went to fulfill that,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 or you go on to fulfill the benefit to all beings.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So the second Gati is fulfilling the benefit for all beings.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Paraṁ gatthi, tahuṁ turuṣi, jinnaramit.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 And the second Paraṁ, the next third, the third one,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 is a Paraṁ Gati,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 now you fulfilled the ultimate of your own benefit,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 therefore, you are went beyond of the expectations.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Beyond of the expectations.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 So there is nothing to expect.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 You reach the full insta, fully fulfilled.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And the next one is Paraṁ saṁ gati,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Paraṁ saṁ gati, that is also,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 now you fulfilled to benefit to all the beings,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 you really went to fulfill the benefit of all beings,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 and therefore there is nothing more for them to go.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 This is the highest thing, perfectly going, perfectly went.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 You did, it's supreme, supreme is fully good.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And then, next, when you went that way, what it comes?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 The great being benefited to all,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 or just to benefit for all the same things,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 means that moment that you have the tremendous support,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 the full development of great compassion,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 compassion that has no discriminations.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Bracing compassion to all the same things.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And for that reason, then you begin to emanate,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 also next one, the Bodhi, this is explained on the Bodhi.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Bodhi is a Buddhahorn, and that is here,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 I called it chilisana, or the master of Vedic explaining,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 because you got great compassion of the without any focus,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 to all living beings.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 For that reason, then you also begin to emanate the many emanations,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 many emanations, those are known as then sambogaya and nirmakayas, nirmakayas.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 And those are then, those who are highly developed disciples,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 or the audience, you appear as sambogaya and nirmakayas.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And then, as well as, those are then, the obstacle beings,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 you appear as nirmakayas and nirmakayas.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 And then also nirmakayas, the many divisions,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 I think you, many of you know, many different emanations of nirmakayas.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 So what is root and cause of that whole emanation is compassion.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Compassion is the principle cause of that emanation,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 and then with, of course, wisdom is struggling with that.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 And for that reason, then this therefore is called bodhi, bodhi.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 And now, bodhi, soha, soha is what? It's a Sanskrit word.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 It is established. Established.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And that is what head teaching said.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 It's called the tandara or the jokin level.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 It means, it's liberated.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Soha means liberated.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 So that means, what, where are you liberated?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 You're liberated only in a status, exactly as we belong.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 You back, you ask, you re-establish it,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 back to that our own nature, awakened state of the rupa.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And who liberated, who established that?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Nobody else established it.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 You established it, or a rupa itself established it,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 back to the rupa status, rupa status, status.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 So that is really the meaning of this mantra of the panya parabola.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Panya parabola is that, according to the jokin level,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 or according to the radio teaching of the jokin levels.
