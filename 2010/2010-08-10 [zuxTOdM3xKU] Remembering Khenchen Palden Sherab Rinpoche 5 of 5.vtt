00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
 "Tobgyal" for 49 days. I'm so happy and so impressed with your dedication, the love, your devotion

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.760
 to the kinder, into the down, that you never complain, you're never going to say anything, but

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.000
 continue to support in heaven. We did practice every day, every day we practice.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.890
 It's something that we just do to the things. So I'm so grateful and thankful for all the support

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 that we have. Really just so special. Actually, it's a marker, that fulfillment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 As Khenchen Rinpoche said too, for the enlightenment, it's not really necessary to support for them

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.320
. But however, we do this ceremony in prayers, it also fulfills us prayer to be more active, more

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 fulfillment of the giving enlightenment as offering.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.700
 We need like-minded beings, like aspirations, and aspirations to perform, to benefit so many beings

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.000
, so many beings.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.030
 So therefore, it's beneficial to fulfillment of the environment, in the same time it benefits to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.000
 ourselves, to remove our obscurations, obstacles, and many defilements.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 So we bring the new dimension of the natures, true nature, understanding that we feel. So that is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.000
 how we feel at home.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.100
 Like Colin Kinwood himself, as Khemasana said, as you all know, we look into the life story of his,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 looking back to his legacy. Life story, he was the one of the very great masters, great

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000
 practitioners, great scholars.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 But yet so humble, so simple, so direct, he keeps his soul on the ground. He never bragged, boosted

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.000
 his realization, his understanding, his knowledge.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.370
 And even some people say that he is really a connection, or he was really a connection of this and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.000
 that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 But he never used those as credentials to boost of any ego-cling or samsara to be received.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 He always states what he was. What he did is the legacy and monument, and that is his credentials.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.530
 When Kinwood looked to his credentials, time was born, and Atreyagandhad Mahaparinarana, he is one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 of the beautiful novel samsara of the Buddha and Muruban Mahasamur, a lineage of what is true.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 He was an old aspect, a scholar aspect, a realization aspect, legacy and monument of the monastery,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 centers, institutions, and what he contributed, put it later to the new Buddhist school, and the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 new ma school.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.830
 And then as well as to us, truly he was the warrior, he was the great bodhisattva in his great

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.000
 dreams.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.180
 So he was, this is one of the true hero of bravery, and for him, he came with beautiful, he left

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.000
 with beautiful.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Beautiful? For that, I mean, for that, we don't have to concern him in worry about that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 But even that is so good for everything. When you look into the historic bag, it was so beautiful.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.950
 But of course, those were left behind, such as me and Lorraine and all of us, as we feel sometimes

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.000
 his head, and his heavy, heavy and difficult.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 His kind of goes on and on sometimes, almost like walking in the desert lands.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.910
 But yet, from reassuring how precious of this light, how precious every time you practice and do

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.000
 good things, well, we have every opportunity in our head in our situation.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.920
 So we feel in those ways, we saw how, and again, thank you to all of you, all of you, thank you for

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.000
 coming by the straight end, keeping up this light as a continuous passage.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.120
 And again, I'm saying thank you, thank you to you, you look like you don't, but we all lost, you

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.000
 know, we lost the same, something that we love.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 We're all in the same boat, and we truly, we did good Sangha memory.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.630
 And Sangha memory, the teaching said, Sangha's meaning of the Sangha is to help and support each

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.000
 other, help each other, support each other, learn from each other.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.800
 And Sangha said, truly, we did that, and stay in one boat, and each day, he had the same feeling,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.000
 same thought, same words.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 So, I was so grateful, and so thankful to all of you. Thank you, thank you very much for coming.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Thank you, and then, you all, in which, Sangha, you said, there is another.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.310
 We have beautiful big women and other victims, and then, I throw them at him, you all know, so I

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.000
 don't have to repeat that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.980
 But truly, we all are so happy and proud that we have a relation to his great master, the disciple

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.000
 who is the great master.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.360
 So, they said, to preserve his legacy and his monument is to, perhaps, meditate with him, which we

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.000
 can make him, as our Sangha, as him.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And that will be another great monument. So, thank you again. Thank you.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 And now, we have some blessings of that, which is a piece of rock, his cloak, and what we did.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.320
 And then, we sailed, put the sail, sail of the Thasamunasik, Muratakho, there, my teaching,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.000
 everywhere, he discovered the low sail of the Skorponi, Skorponi.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.990
 So, Kirubali has that too, and so, we sailed, that sailed on, and these, these physical clothes,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.000
 and then, with the photo of that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 So, we like to offer you that, and as blessings and remembrance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.100
 And then, I will also have our Sangha member organize with the Chairwoman, and put yourself back in

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.000
, to lecture you.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So, we like to offer that to you, as Ali and Lorraine.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 So, we were one who stayed last, his kind of physical, in this world.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 So, we thought we would take that to you. So, please welcome Ali.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Ali, then, also, we like to thank you, to the same team, same team, that this beautiful Thaka,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 again.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.480
 And we asked to each other much, and, of course, you all know each other much. He is one of the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.000
 great masters,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and such teachers, leading, and oldest of the master's of the new schools.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 So, we asked him what to do, and through his daughters, we got the message, that we should do,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 he's relaxed, as many as Chassas, and then, also, we should thank the Thakas of the 35 Buddhas,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.770
 Buddhas of the qualifications, and so, that he told, that we can do that before the 49 days, which

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.000
 is really good, you see.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.460
 So, then, we don't have, I mean, Chassas we're making, that indicating Dara Dev, awesome, making

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.000
 that.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Then, of course, then, we have beautiful artists here. I said he was very devoted to the King,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.210
 so immediately we asked him. So, ever since then, he started, then, this beautiful Thaka of the 35

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.000
 Buddhas,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 on the King, which as Chara Dev has started, not just only Thaka he met, Beddha, but he saw this,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 saw it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.230
 The broadcast, this is how it works, so thank you very much, if you said you were ever going to do

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.000
 that.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:55.990
 And also, we were able to make the Chassas, and then, at the beginning of the time, I jokingly said

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.000
 to Dara and Mark and Katie,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 "I'd like to make one thousand eight Chassas." He says, "Wow." He says, "Okay, recall."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 I also really thought that the cannot have. One thousand eight Chassas is large, large.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.800
 So, then, they started making Chassas ever since we passed one thousand eight, I think one thousand

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.000
 thirty-five.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.540
 And then, I think when we live, I said that all the ceremony we do, every day here, is a neat

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.000
 preparation.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 It needs so many things, this and this thing, a neat, delicately, joyful effort to continue it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 And I just said, one time, two times, and the Sangha members all support it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:02.300
 Lya, Japa, and Lorraine, Amilda, Laura, and Demi, I can see, and the Sangha members here, and Eric,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:09.000
 and Anu, Anu, and Katie.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.650
 I mean, so many really support it. I think, again, I must be broke at the level, so I want to take

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.000
 that all.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And then, they will learn from the violence, I think. But, thank you, everybody, we support it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 We thought, always, and whether you say, lifting up the carpet in four corners.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 And then, truly, we did. We left up the carpet in four corners to maintain the outside, all this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 I mean, all this, the dark, and the calm, and the words, I mean, so many support it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And they will be able to go through it. Thank you, again.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So, you know, say, we will take the office, and then we will do this. We will offer these things.
