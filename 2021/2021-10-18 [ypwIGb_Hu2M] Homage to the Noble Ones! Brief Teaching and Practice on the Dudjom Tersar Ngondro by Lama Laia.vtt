00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 And so as always, before we begin any practice, any study, any reflection, we just again connect

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.480
 with our motivation and our intention of what we're doing. So we have these three essential

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.920
 motivations we try to remember again and again and again, because they're the essence of

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.480
 the whole great perfection teachings of the three yanas that we're all working on understanding

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.040
 and realizing for the benefit of all beings. So again, just connecting with our joy, our

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.920
 appreciation, how precious this moment is, how precious this life is, how precious to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.280
 have these teachings in our life, all these four thoughts that turn the mind toward the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:08.760
 Dharma. And then of course, expanding our vast bodhicitta impartially to all beings that,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.360
 you know, through this, this time of practicing together, as well as all the things we can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.840
 do in this life can truly be nothing but benefit for all beings as limitless as space. And

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 then also with great devotion, recognize and relax with the innate purity of how perfect

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.760
 this moment is. And so we'll just take a moment expanding our bodhicitta, relaxing in our

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:53.640
 joy, appreciation, devotion.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:19.960
 So I guess just before we begin our practice, we've been slowly just each time we meet reflecting

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 on different kind of reminders to help us keep fresh with our practice and also kind of reflect

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.200
 on the basic the framework of all the teachings we've been given. And these nundro teachings

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.920
 are of course, the essence of all Buddhist practice, all the Buddhist teachings. And

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.080
 that's why they're so essential as we've heard, or maybe we haven't. But nundro means

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.200
 the kind of the foundations, what really needs to be firmly established in our minds and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 our hearts in order to really be a benefit for ourselves and others with a practice that's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.480
 alive. And so we, we're going to just do the practice if anyone's new to that, we'll do

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:18.680
 that. And I think we've been kind of slowly going over the structure of the nundro, which

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.440
 of course, like I just said, begins with our renunciation or our joy, our appreciation,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:37.080
 how precious the moment is, that's, and then bodhicitta, absolute and relative. And our

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 pure perception, our awe at the innate purity of all phenomena and kind of being introduced

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.960
 to that view, but then how we stabilize that is what's going to make the difference. And

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.160
 so within the structure of, of the nundro practice, we have, of course, just our opening

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.840
 prayers. And then we've kind of gone over to some degree, the four thoughts that turn

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.200
 the mind toward the Dharma, which are basically in our formal practice, as well as our informal

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.240
 when we're out in the world, just trying to reflect again and again and again, on how

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:34.920
 is it, how precious this life is, this precious human birth, and how precious and rare it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:43.480
 is. And also how in looking at impermanence, just again and again, reflecting on how everything's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:56.600
 changing, ceaselessly ceasing, never for a moment still. And then reflecting on the teachings

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.560
 of Karma, of cause and effect, that all of our actions based on our perception and our

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.240
 motivation have results. And those results are nothing but exponential fruition of like

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.440
 that basic state of mind that our actions of body, speech and mind do. They follow us

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.400
 like, they say like a bird, a shadow follows a bird. When the causes and conditions meet,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.920
 they ripen. So just the inevitability of our action, the results of our actions. And it's

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.240
 our motivation that makes all the difference. And then how we meet those, of course, how

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.760
 we meet what arises makes the difference for the future. And then of course, in the fourth

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:59.560
 thought, just looking at samsara, that samsara is misunderstanding the nature as it is. And

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:08.520
 through that misperception, we're all deluded, we're all misunderstanding. Therefore, we're

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 challenged. We're going against how things are. So samsara, all aspects is nothing but

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:25.120
 challenge, is suffering, is uncomfortable. So just looking at how that's true, both according

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.040
 to the great wisdom words of those who know and see, as well as what we can see in our

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.120
 own lives, just looking at our own experience, observing the world. So these four outer thoughts

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.240
 just beginning every practice by reflecting on these thoughts and again, bringing them

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.880
 up in our mind from time to time throughout the day, just really helps us to, like Rinpoche

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.800
 says, soften our mind and heart, bring some warmth and moisture to really realize what's

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:05.800
 truly beautiful, what's really reliable, what turns our mind towards the Dharma. And so then

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.680
 we started to talk a little bit more about the process of taking refuge, which is the

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:25.380
 inner essential really profound nundro practice. And again, refuge is the gateway to all Buddhist

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:34.640
 practice. Refuge, the essence of refuge means where have some degree of trust and confidence

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:44.080
 in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and all of that is entailed and embodied within

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:54.120
 the Buddha, within the realization of the teacher. And so we've gone over a little bit

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:02.880
 of what is Buddha, the life of the Buddha, outer Buddha, inner Buddha, absolute Buddha,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:14.100
 which is also having trust and confidence in our own basic goodness and wisdom and intelligence

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:23.040
 and capacity, natural capacity for love and compassion, the Buddha nature. Like again,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.760
 just as always a good reminder for me at least, the only difference between fully realized

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:37.600
 Buddha and ordinary being is the degree to which we realize that. And here with our nundro

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.660
 practice, Gurumpushe is always present. So both in our formal practice, we're keeping

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:50.120
 the presence of Gurumpushe, as well as as we walk in the day, trying to feel that presence

00:08:50.120 --> 00:09:00.080
 and the all-pervading wisdom, love, compassion, teaching to awaken us into our own basic goodness

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.720
 and bring out our good qualities and purify our misunderstandings and the results of actions

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.560
 we've done with them using all these skillful means. And of course, our formal practice

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:20.200
 time is a time we can really touch home base in order to really awaken and refresh with

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:27.560
 what's natural and good and again and again and just keep going and keep going through

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:39.520
 all the paths and stages of realization that all the different Sangha have. And so I guess

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.400
 again we don't have a whole lot of time and we all have so many books at hand, you know,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.960
 from our precious teachers as well as so many other lineage masters. But just again, maybe

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.200
 just for a few moments, remembering, reflecting on when we take refuge and then Dharma, what

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.100
 is the Dharma? So I guess right in that and again, I know I'm not seeing anything new

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.920
 and I'm sure there's people who know a lot more than I do, not to mention realize that

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:19.200
 more than I have, but we're all here reflecting ourselves. The Dharma is so huge, so vast,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.060
 so rich, it's the nature itself expressing and turning our minds, awakening us to understanding.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:36.920
 So the Buddha taught according to, you know, the capacities of all beings. The Buddha is

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:47.500
 that mind of enlightenment, the realization of the nature as it is, that great vast openness.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.440
 The Dharma is the natural expression the Buddha gave, both the teachings, the words, the

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.720
 demonstrations,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.880
 the actions, the example of what the Buddha made and Guru Rinpoche made, all the great

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:10.640
 ones have made. And so those teachings are going to every being according to their needs,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.600
 including ourselves. Like, you know, there's a beautiful in one of the sutras, I just wrote

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.200
 it down, I think it's called the Lankavara Sutra, which is essentially saying, like I

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:31.280
 said earlier, the only difference between a Buddha and ordinary sentient being is how

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:40.080
 much one realizes Buddha has complete realization, fully awakened, completely purified, wisdom,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.680
 love, compassion. And the only difference is then the degree of misunderstanding or

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.840
 delusion or not knowing that nature as it is. So the quote goes as long as there are

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:07.440
 deluded minds, there will be no limit to the number of vehicles. Once delusion comes to

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:15.680
 an end, there will be neither vehicles nor sentient beings. So, you know, I guess in

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.640
 my own mind, one way of saying that, by here, we're talking about vehicles. That's like

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:27.200
 what are the tools the Buddha gives us to explore the nature and to remove our, correct

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.760
 our misunderstanding. Dharma, like Kimpocheung Rinpoche really emphasized, the meaning of

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:43.760
 Dharma means to redirect and correct. So it's kind of like how in what moving how to correct

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:51.000
 our misunderstanding of how things are and our mishandling of the nature and power of

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.520
 our own mind. And so the Buddha taught again, according to the needs of all of everyone,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:08.840
 everywhere beings, you know. So as far as there are beings, there's that many teachings,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:17.320
 as many as there are negative emotions, there's teachings to help purify and uproot and transform

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:26.440
 all of those. And of course, these were vehicle or the yanas were given, you know, as we said,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:33.280
 the Buddha taught, all those teachings went throughout all Asia, the light of Asia, came

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:41.600
 to Tibet in the eighth century through the great devotion and courage of King Trisandetsen.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.640
 And then inviting Kimpo Shanta Rakshita and Guru Padmasambhava to really establish the

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:55.400
 teachings. And something that's so beautiful about that is it embodies all the whole spectrum,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.680
 the full great wholeness of all the Buddha's teachings came to Tibet. And our practice

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.380
 to this day, and that's what we've been given and what we're touching and reflecting on

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:14.680
 and absorbing into our own mind and heart with our practice. So these vehicles, again, Lama

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.760
 drop was mentioned. And of course, it's true. All the teachers, all the great ones are saying,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:28.200
 but the vehicle means it's something that helps us usher our mind towards realization.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.640
 That's why it's so important we relax, we allow change to happen and not be of course, it's

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.960
 good to connect with the teachings, but understand that they're going to usher our mind into

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:47.040
 realization. Because that's also the two kinds of Dharma we've all heard of, right? There's

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.060
 the scripture, there's the words, there's the teachings, and then there's the realization.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:00.840
 So that's where it's talking about, when as the teachings, the vehicles, the yanas are

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 there to help us realize and awaken. And through that they kind of disappear and subsume and

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:20.100
 then we get more. So we could again reflect on these three yanas is one basic way of looking

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:28.240
 at what's Dharma. You know, there's the foundational teachings, which is basic again, like we said,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:43.680
 our renunciation, more contentment, you know, less obsession with this life. And kind of

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.360
 looking at our conduct and what causes refraining from what causes more harm, more disturbance

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.480
 for ourselves and others. What really looking for ourselves, what creates more peace, more

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:05.920
 harmony for ourselves and others. And ultimately taking responsibility for our own experience

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.680
 to the best of our ability, according to our capacities. It's the essence of all the teachings.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:25.600
 And then the basics of renunciation, contentment, less grasping, kind of look and then as far

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:33.320
 as what the foundational teachings or Theravada, the basic teachings that the Buddha first

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:41.320
 gave looking at the Four Noble Truths, the truth of suffering. Again, I'm glossing over

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.120
 because I know many of us know these so we can reflect on the meaning quickly. And we

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.920
 can look at books too, because our real point is here, we're going to practice, but I'm

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.800
 just trying to refresh and reflect maybe one way of like holding Dharma. What when we're

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:08.320
 taking refuge in the Dharma. And so the basic kind of essence of the foundational teachings

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.480
 or the first turning of the teachings that the Buddha gave were these essential teachings

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:27.000
 on kind of on the relative level that there is no self, you know, looking at Karma, how

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:39.960
 cause and effect happen, interdependent coordination, the Four Noble Truths, all these kind of

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.320
 really

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.120
 essential teachings, foundational teachings of looking through our own ways we can in

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:56.760
 our own experience kind of begin to see how, how, how we're identifying as I as our self,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:03.880
 what that constitutes that and begin to see how open that is and how kind of essence less

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:13.320
 how there's no interdependent, independent me that we can really find if we really explore.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:21.320
 And then of course, on the philosophical level, we have like these basic, basic philosophical

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:30.280
 views that are established in the philosophical schools of basic Buddhism of fundamental Buddhism,

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.900
 where you know, kind of on the relative level, there's, there's the aggregates, there's the

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:44.240
 elements, there's the, the ways we constitute our experience. And but we can see that they're

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.480
 selfless, that we are selfless in nature. But still, that's on the relative level, but

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:57.120
 on the absolute level. Again, according to this philosophy, this basic philosophy, kind

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:05.040
 of according to our own capacities, then the teachings are that there's actually are kind

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:13.640
 of substantially existing particles, like maybe in our modern science of atoms or something.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:23.740
 And then there's also moments of time that are substantially existing. And yet, our experiences

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:34.280
 on a relative level, that's kind of like not seeing that absolute truth, clearly. And then

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:40.040
 when that's investigated a little further, then philosophically speaking, it's established

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:53.080
 how there, there's still no self. And there's also no substantially existing particles.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:20:02.000
 And there are substantially existing moments of consciousness. And of course, there's a

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.160
 whole very complicated expositions on kind of how that views established. But those are

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.320
 just the philosophical view and investigation of reality, that's kind of within the fun,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.320
 the foundational Buddhism. Then, of course, sometimes foundational Buddhism is called

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:33.720
 Hinayana, which is not a derogatory term, but it means, you know, in relation to Hinayana,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:40.680
 the Mahayana teachings and philosophical views are greater. You know, the view is greater,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.160
 the result is greater. And of course, the real essence of the Mahayana is the teachings

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:57.560
 on bodhichitta, of absolute bodhichitta, relative bodhichitta, the Paramita practices, the four

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:04.400
 boundless thoughts, you know, kind of intentional bodhichitta, fruitional kind of actualizing

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 bodhichitta. And then also the teachings on the nature as it is, which is then this is

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.560
 kind of called the second turning of the Buddhist teachings. So in the first teaching, the Buddha

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:23.640
 is kind of establishing our ordinary kind of impure relative truth experience, ways

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:30.160
 that we can in our experience, explore it, the reality of it, and see how it's open,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.920
 like for ourselves, not this kind of high flying, vast view, but actually engage in

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:45.120
 a way that again, ushers us towards a clear understanding. And so then, great the Prajnaparamita

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:57.380
 teachings, the teachings on the great emptiness, that not only is self, empty, but other,

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:57.600
 everything

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.000
 is empty. And of course, if we just read through recite and reflect on the meaning of the heart

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:11.800
 sutra, all these teachings are right there. So on that level, the absolute truth, in one

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:21.800
 way begins to be then that everything is mind. So the mind only or the Chitta mantra, philosophical

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:28.640
 view is established. And then through investigating that, really led to say, well, where what

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:38.920
 is mind? Where is mind? And then the Madhyamaka or the completely free of extremes philosophy,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:44.800
 sometimes called the middle way. And here middle way doesn't mean it's in the middle

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:54.120
 means free of extremes. So then we know things are established as being free of existing,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:03.440
 non existing, both neither. Anyway, we look, things can be nothing holds up under analysis.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:09.320
 If we're really got our wits together, and look clearly, we have tools to really see

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.880
 again more directly, at least intellectually, how things are empty and yet appearing, not

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.200
 trying to negate anything, but really just show with the power and the gift of our intellect,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:35.080
 if we explore reality, there's nothing substantial to find. And then so based on this really

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:42.400
 view of great emptiness, and then the pure and the inseparability of appearances and

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:54.080
 emptiness is then what we have with the Vajrayana, the great unity of emptiness, and clarity

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:02.480
 of compassion, and emptiness of wisdom and compassion, skillful means and wisdom, all

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:13.200
 the many different words, but that inseparability of everything appearing, being pure in nature.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.160
 So that's where it starts to move into pure relative truth, because in the the Vajrayana

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:29.040
 Dharma is where we're going right to a realized view of how everything, all that appears,

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:37.480
 this Buddha nature is intrinsically pure. And looking to its nature helps us through

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:46.200
 our many skillful means realize that. So I mean, this is kind of big, big view, and lots

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:54.640
 of details. But I guess the essence of the Dharma is also one way of subsumed or kind

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.360
 of categorized into three baskets, which I know we've all heard, but these three treasuries

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.160
 that no matter what level on the Theravadin foundational level of the teachings, on the

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:14.280
 Mahayana level, Vajrayana level, the three baskets are within all of those. And what

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:26.680
 are the three baskets? So that's Vinaya Sutra Abhidharma essence of Vinaya. We've heard

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:38.120
 is what is our conduct and morality, kind of again, looking at what's appropriate, what's

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:45.800
 going to be appropriate and beneficial for the situations we're in, for ourselves at

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.920
 our current capacities and the capacities of others being more and more attuned to that

00:25:50.920 --> 00:26:02.920
 and acting appropriately according to the situation. The essence of the Sutra is the

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:12.840
 concentration, the teachings on concentration and the training is concentration of how to

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:22.240
 focus, how to really not be distracted. The essence of the Abhidharma is wisdom, how things

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:30.000
 are. So again, we're trying to not only hear the words and have lots of books and remember

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.920
 lots of lists but use them as a means to really absorb in our heart and mind and have some

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:49.680
 change for ourselves. So basically training ourselves in pure conduct, you know, of not

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.200
 being less, more focused, less distracted and seeing more and more clearly things as

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.760
 they are, both relatively and absolutely. That's the essence of the three baskets and

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:09.200
 then the three trainings that we're doing with all this practice. And of course then

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.200
 to the essence of all the Buddhist teachings we can all look at are what are these four

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.920
 seals, right? Again, just as we're practicing, look again, just see how much we're keeping

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:30.080
 these in our minds or exploring how is it true or even looking how is this not true.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.900
 The essence of all the Buddhist teachings, what really shows them all that everything

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:48.640
 is impermanent. How much are we taking that to heart, just reflecting on that time to

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:57.120
 time or seeing how it is how things are impermanent and how great that they're impermanent. Of

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.080
 course we can lose things through impermanence that's because we've grasped to them that

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:11.920
 they exist in the first place. But also if we think about through because things are

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:20.920
 impermanent that's how we can awaken that this experience of samsara as samsara beings

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:29.480
 it's based on impermanence. It's based on misunderstanding. That essence of the Buddhist

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.080
 teachings are things aren't just impermanent. It's also all of our from our ignorance, our

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:53.620
 attachment, our anger, jealousy, doubt, hesitation. All emotions are based in uncomfortableness.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:06.120
 And then how all phenomena are empty of any being substantially independent, permanent.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:13.600
 Everything is relying on other things to be something including ourselves and the universe

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:23.120
 we inhabit and exist. And then the fourth seal is of course nirvana is peace or which

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:30.360
 means beyond concepts. It's free of extremes. When we really understand things are as at

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:41.840
 all we're we're not relying on extremes of existing, non-existing both either blah blah.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:48.100
 So I guess that should wrap it up but we can all do this. But as we're doing our refuge

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:54.880
 practice really as we're standing there before Guru Padmasambhava and all the refuge tree

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:02.360
 together in one voice with all the beings of the six realms, you know kind of reflecting

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:08.280
 on the qualities of the Buddha, the meaning of the Buddha, what we can recall and remember

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:16.280
 of what is the Dharma, both the teachings of the Dharma as well as you know the realization,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:25.480
 the view, the meditation, the conduct, the results of Dharma which are embodied in all

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.940
 the Sangha. Be there other ordinary beings all aspiring and practicing engaging just

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:39.080
 beginning on the path to those you know the Arhats, the Pratyaka Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.440
 you know all up through the Bhumis to all the fully enlightened Buddhas you know are

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:53.520
 all are Sangha. So just all embodied as Guru Vipashay. So just that's all. And again the

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.040
 Buddhas in all the teachings the Dharma is pointing out the nature as it is. It's just

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.040
 as we go like through these yanas through these vehicles the teachings are just more

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:14.160
 and more direct, more and more vast, more and more detailed. And so there we have it

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.800
 and it's up to all of us just again through our study, through contemplation and then

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:27.000
 through really sitting with our practice and being with it day to day through all life's

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.280
 ups and downs and that's how we're transforming, that's how we're purifying, that's how we're

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:39.200
 awakening is trying to keep awake within our experience using our formal practice but not

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:46.440
 leaving it behind us bringing that out into the world. Good. And like Rinpoche say Ken

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:55.740
 Shinpalden, Kenpose Wang Rinpoche the essence of Dharma is gentleness just being more calm

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:08.760
 being more understanding, more content, less distracted, more bodhicitta even if we don't

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:15.520
 know all these big lists and things just working with trying to do that is enough. So maybe

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:27.360
 we'll call that it for talking so thank you for your patience and I hope that's helpful

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.400
 or at least and like I've said before and I'll say again we all have heard so many teachings

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:40.040
 and we've all been practicing we all have our own direct perception and knowledge of

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.080
 the teachings and just we're all here to support each other to reflect on that and to take

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:54.960
 those to heart and just keep going. Just like the Prajnaparamita mantra, gatte gatte paragatte

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:05.400
 parasam gatte bodhiso ha we'll just open, open, keep opening really day in and day out

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:11.520
 just try to go and if we fall in the ditch like Rinpoche says get up and start again

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:18.800
 purify acknowledge our mistakes as mistakes, connect with our intention, connect with our

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:27.000
 bodhicitta, refresh, relax, keep going through all the paths, through all the boomies till

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.600
 we're fully enlightened as along the way trying to be of benefit to the best of our abilities

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:40.340
 at least not causing any more trouble for ourselves and for the world so thank you I'll

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.640
 be quiet now and we'll practice together.
