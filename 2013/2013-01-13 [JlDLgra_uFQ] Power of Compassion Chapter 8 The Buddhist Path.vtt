NOTE     "synopsis": "On December 10, 2012 at Padma Samye Ling, the local sangha recorded the eighth PBC Morning Dawn Study Group webcast where they discussed Chapter 8 of The Buddhist Path by the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches, entitled \"The Power of Compassion.\"\n\nTwo Main Topics Being Discussed:\n\n1. \"Pure compassion has the power to remove all the karmic obscurations and obstacles to enlightenment. As inner wisdom is uncovered, your understanding of relative and absolute truth increases as you progress toward enlightenment. The Buddha said many times that compassion is the most powerful tool for removing ignorance and increasing wisdom. ... Guru Padmasambhava taught that without compassion, dharma practice will not bear fruit, and in fact, without compassion your practice will become rotten.\" (pg 41, 1st paragraph & pg 43 last paragraph)\n\n2.  \"When he saw Maitreya he was overjoyed, but at the same time he was rather upset. After practicing for so many years, it was only when Asanga saw the old dog that Maitreya had revealed himself. Asanga started crying and asked Maitreya why he had not shown himself sooner. Maitreya replied, \"I was not uncompassionate to you. From the first day you arrived at the cave I was always with you. But until today your obscurations blocked your view. Now you see me because of your great compassion for the dog. That compassion removed your obscurations to the point that you can see me.\"\" (pg 43, 1st full paragraph)\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nsix paramitas [Skt. satparamita; Tib. pha rol tu phyin pa drug]. The \"six perfections\" are a bridge we use to cross from samsara's shore of delusion to the other shore of enlightenment, and are thus the principal practices of the bodhisattvas. They are (1) generosity, (2) self-discipline, (3) patience, (4) joyful effort, (5) concentration, and (6) wisdom.\n\nThe third pa\u0304ramita\u0304 of patience trains us to be steady and open-hearted in the face of difficult people and circumstances. Patience entails cultivating skillful courageousness, mindfulness, and tolerance. The three categories of patience are (A) patience with enemies, (B) patience with hardships on the path, and (C) patience with the ups and downs of life.\n\nTo download the pdf of all the Main Topics, Concepts, and PBC YouTube Videos to refer to for this PBC Morning Dawn Study Webcast, go to the main \"Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\" Facebook page: www.padmasambhava.org/facebook\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

 Happy New Year! Welcome to Padmasamyaling, the Venerable Kherpmo Rinpoches' Monastery and Retreat

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.000
 Center in New York.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.800
 We are doing the 8th Morning Dawn webcast, and today we will be discussing the chapter "The Power

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 of Compassion" from the Venerable Khemper Rinpoches book, "The Buddhist Path".

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 First, we will just do our usual opening prayers, and then we will go into the discussion. Thanks!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 So this chapter 8 of "The Buddhist Path" is mainly going over the story of the great master Asanga,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 and so maybe you thought Amanda would just kind of overview this story.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So then after that, we will go into these main topic points of discussion in this group.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.780
 So this is the chapter on "The Power of Compassion", and basically the Rinpoches start out by

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.000
 talking about how compassion is the most powerful tool for overcoming our karmic obscurations,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 and also for overcoming obstacles to enlightenment, so compassion being so important.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.970
 And then they go into this story about Asanga, who is a famous Indian scholar, about 500 years

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.000
 after the Buddha's time.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.650
 And he was really very learned, and he still had many questions and sort of doubts that he wasn't

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.000
 getting resolved,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 so he decided to go on a retreat, do practice on Maitreya, Buddha Maitreya, future Buddha.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.490
 So he went into retreat, and he was there for about 3 years, doing a lot of retreat on Buddha Mait

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.000
reya,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 and then after those 3 years he didn't have any signs really of having gotten to meet Maitreya,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 which he really wanted, so then he decided to leave retreat.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 So he was leaving retreat, and the first thing he encountered was an old man, and this man was

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.000
 rubbing an iron rod with silk, a piece of silk,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 and he was trying to make a needle out of this iron rod.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.180
 And so Asanga saw this and really just realized, wow, what patience, this is extraordinary, the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.000
 patience this man has to do this.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 I can continue my retreat, so then he decided to go back into retreat.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.180
 He went into retreat for 3 more years, and again he had some dreams of Maitreya, but he was really

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.000
 longing to meet Maitreya, and he didn't.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And so he left again after, so now that's 6 years, and he was leaving, and this time he was looking

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and he saw a pool of water and rocks,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 and he saw like where this one drops of water were falling on a rock and created a hole.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.420
 Just slowly, a drop by drop, this hole had been created in a rock, and he realized, oh wow, so much

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.000
 time, you know,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.110
 but look what can be done after with just diligence, and he says, okay, I'm going to go back into

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.000
 retreat.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So he went back into retreat again for 3 more years.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Still during this time he continued to have more dreams and positive signs of Maitreya,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.460
 but then still Maitreya didn't appear to him, or at least he didn't get to ask the questions that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.000
 he wanted to ask Maitreya.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.440
 So he left again, and this time he saw something else, he saw this rock that had become shiny from

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.000
 a bird,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.330
 I guess like rubbing its wings up against this rock, and again like thinking how much time that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.000
 must take for a bird's wings to create a shiny rock.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.650
 He thought, wow, you know, I could take some more time and keep trying, so he went back in again

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.000
 for 3 more years,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and still he didn't have, he didn't meet Maitreya. So this is 12 years of retreat.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And then after that he left, and this time he was going down the mountain, and he encountered a dog

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 that was severely injured and wounded,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.430
 and had like I think just like the bottom half of his body was kind of his skin had been eaten, and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.000
 he had maggots and fleas on his skin.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.530
 And so Asanga saw this and felt such compassion for this dog, contemplating the Buddha and how the

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.000
 compassion of the Buddha,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 he decided, you know, I'm going to try to act similarly and help this dog.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.430
 And so he realized he couldn't use his hands, because he'd injured the fleas or the maggots, and so

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.000
 he used his tongue.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And he went down, you know, and started to approach the dog to lick the maggots off the dog's skin.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And immediately his tongue kept hitting the ground, so he wasn't actually getting the dog.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And when he looked up, he saw Buddha Maitreya. So, you know, illustrating that after so much time,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 you know, he did get to see him.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.200
 And Maitreya said, "The only reason I've been with you all this time, and the only reason you're

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.000
 only seeing me now is because due to the power of your compassion for this dog."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So illustrating that point of just how powerful compassion is.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.850
 And then at the very end, Rinpoche has concluded the chapter about how really essential compassion

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:53.000
 is, that without it, our practice is rotten.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.160
 So the first main topic point takes place on page 41, the first paragraph, and page 43, the last

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.000
 paragraph.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.830
 It says, "Pure compassion has the power to remove all karmic obscurations and obstacles to

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.000
 enlightenment.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.400
 As inner wisdom is uncovered, your understanding of relative and absolute truth increases as you

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.000
 progress towards enlightenment."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.600
 The Buddha said many times that compassion is the most powerful tool for removing endurance and

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.000
 increasing wisdom.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.670
 Guru Padmasambhava taught that without compassion, Dharma practice will not bear fruit, and in fact

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.000
, without compassion, your practice will become rotten.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So my question was just, "What makes compassion so special? Why compassion?"

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 You know, I heard a story this weekend, actually the woman was telling me this story.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.870
 She had lost her daughter in a car accident about 12 years ago, and right after that, she couldn't

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.000
 do Christmas.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.950
 Couldn't do Christmas at all, particularly for anyone who's lost a child, holidays become a very

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.000
 hard time because they have a lot of memories.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 So she didn't bring out the tree at all, couldn't do any of the different things.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 They actually just went to Virgita. It was as good as far as ways they could.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.130
 And over the years, she just couldn't really bring herself around to do it. It was too painful, too

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.000
 many memories.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And she has two other daughters who are now in their teens, I think.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And this year, her husband had decided to get this really big Christmas tree.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.570
 I guess for him, he'd finally come around and said, "You know, it's time he got a 12-foot Christmas

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.000
 tree, fill the living room."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.610
 And her daughters were having this wonderful time finding Christmas ornaments, putting them up on

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.000
 the tree,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 dancing around the garlands, dressing up the tree.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And at one point, they had realized that they didn't have enough ornaments to fill up the tree.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.260
 And they said, "Mom, we don't have enough ornaments." She said, "Actually, we do. They're up in the

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.000
 attic.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 They're the ornaments we had from when your sister was still alive. You go up and get them."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And the thing that made the story so interesting was the fact that she was saying, afterwards, she

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.000
's like,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.300
 she could not bring herself to do that on her own. She couldn't revisit that pain for her own

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.000
 benefit.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 But when she saw her daughters having such a wonderful time, that was that thing that moved her.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.130
 It's like, okay, it's okay to go back there. I can have patience with that. I can be there with

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.000
 that pain.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 I can go back through that for other people.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.080
 It reminded me a lot of the story. Actually, it was funny. I didn't even realize the 12 years part

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.000
 lined up, too.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.460
 Because it had been 12 years since she had had a Christmas. But it's that willingness to revisit

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.000
 things,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.260
 to go through things for other people. That's what compassion can do. Really move you beyond

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.000
 yourself.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 It was just a story that reminded me of this chapter.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 It seems like compassion is, too, that aspect. Like earlier, we were talking about loving kindness.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And all of this is relating back to bodhicitta, of course, but the absolute bodhicitta,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.230
 and then our inspiration and our vision, and just how compassion is kind of based on loving

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.000
 kindness,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 but the way compassion is actually, maybe when we begin to actualize, to actually make an outward,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 we have that love, and we have not only a love, but a desire to help,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 and a desire to comfort beings and to uplift their minds and hearts.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 It's kind of, in a way, maybe it's related to that actualizing power, too, as far as bodhicitta.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And it, of course, is based on thinking of other ascent. I mean, I think that's definitely related

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 to that, too.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 You know, a big thing, or something that struck me very strongly,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 that I've heard from His Holiness Dala Lama before,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.490
 is he said, if we really take, or he was saying, genuine compassion is when not only we have a

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.000
 natural sympathy

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 for other beings' suffering, but we actually take responsibility to help end that suffering,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.050
 to do what we really can that's available to us, to take responsibility to actually remove that

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.000
 suffering.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And it's really, the emphasis point that struck me was it really strongly, it's not just a wish,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 there is this aspiring bodhicitta, for sure, but then it really, we have to actually engage it,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 we have to, in a sense, make ourselves vulnerable, and to go into an unfamiliar thing,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 and to really put ourselves at risk, in a way, just like in this story with the dog,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 and just this overwhelming concern for this dog, and like, a song is probably going to get sick,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 and he's going to get mauled by this dog, you know, when he goes down to try to save the maggots.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.820
 But it's the responsibility, it's not just a feel good, I'm with you, but I'm not really going to

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.000
 do much

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 to actually help you, kind of a sympathy.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 You can see there, too, like the way that relates back to the six-fire mitas,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 which are now part of the concepts and things, but the way the six-fire mitas are like that,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 as far as actualizing that intention and thinking of others, you know, in a way, if you think,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 you know, also a song that was also, he wasn't just thinking about the dog,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 he was thinking about like the maggots that were in the dog, and I mean, of course,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 but just so there's like all of that generosity, there's that mindfulness,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 and trying out what's the most appropriate way to fix this situation, you know,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 like really keeping like a wider vision of everything involved in it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 I mean, and again, I mean, obviously, he had all the patience to just get him to that point,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 but then also even with that, even being willing to deal with, you know,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 cutting his flesh and taking the maggots out with his tongue, and all these things,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 and they're just ways to relate him back, but just the way the six-fire mitas really,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 are that part of the way of engaging and really developing our footage into, you know.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 I mean, like I was, like about, along the same lines of everything that people have said,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 like, why is compassion important?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Like, well, if we look at the form of measurables,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 you know, beings have happiness and a cause of happiness, that's the love component.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 May they be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 So I think one of the essential points here is, everyone is kind of suffering,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 you know, like we're in the difficult circumstances, like,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 and from the practical perspective, if everyone has been our mothers or our fathers

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 or our dear friend and benefited us countless times forever, you know,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 I mean, that's what the teachings say.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And the only thing they want is happiness and to not have suffering,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 but yet they continuously, I mean, by then, we, you know,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 continuously engage in all these activities that are actually the causes of suffering.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 So it's like, everyone keeps doing things that just brings more suffering,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 but yet everyone wants to be happy, and it's just such a, it's like, in a certain sense,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 it's just such a poignant circumstance to see that, like,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 and that's, again, I keep quoting this, the words of my perfect teacher Kimpo Nachum,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 he wrote a commentary on it, and he said, what is the cause of happiness?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It's the belief that in karma, so, you know, that's the vehicle of gods and humans,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 which means you do virtuous things and therefore you obtain higher rebirths.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 That's the, that's the, basically the Pratimonta, I mean, that's the gods and humans.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 The second one is the wish to, the determination to attain liberation.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 That's more like the Pratimonta, the Shravatayana, where you're like,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I really want to be free from samsara for myself.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And then the final one is, it's bodhicitta.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 It's like, may everyone have this, may everyone, you know, enjoy the,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 be free from the causes of suffering.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 But, I don't know, it just seems like, along these lines,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 where the cult of any requirement does and everything,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 if your dearest mother and your kindest friend is just like,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 once you see clearly the situation of like, how everyone wants to be happy,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 but yet how everyone is just constantly doing things that like,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 is the cause of unhappiness.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 And just, not just now, but like, long into the future.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Then, I mean, compassion is like, that's not just a negative aspect.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 I'm like, you could emphasize it and it could be really, you know, upsetting,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 but in a certain sense, it is upsetting when you realize it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 It's just like, you know, well, everyone wants to be free from suffering,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 but it's never going to happen.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And like Japa said, like, those four things, like,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 would you take it upon yourself, you know, like,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 wouldn't it be great if they were free from suffering, you know?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Like, may they be free from suffering, that's the second aspiration.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 I will be the one to do that.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 I will be the one to leave them, that's the third aspiration.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And the fourth one is, praying to the three jewels and saying,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 please, you know, like, help me, help all these beings,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 like, be free from suffering.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Anyway, I know it's a little long-winded, but it's kind of a little overview.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 And like Maitreya, I mean, at this one last point is like,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 how good of a motivation is that?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 That's the best motivation you could possibly have,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 to free all beings from suffering.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And Maitreya walks by, there's other versions of this story too,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 and he sees people doing something totally useless,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 like, spending all their time to make a needle out of metal,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 or like, wiping a boulder so that the sun can come in the house.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 That's another version of the story.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And the sun is like, if they spend all this time

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 to do something so useless as just to make a needle,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 and they are willing to do that for years and years and years,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 well, what is my goal?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Is to totally bring all beings to complete enlightenment

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 so they'll never have experienced suffering again.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Then it's like, okay, they'll be willing to do that,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 but I should be willing to spend a couple more years in retreat.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Sorry for the long-windedness.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 I was wondering what practice it's like.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Asanga, he didn't have Vajrayana, right?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 He was before Vajrayana?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 I thought I saw him here, at least in the chapter it talked about,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 he had received empowerment in teaching some of Maitreya,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 before he went in, and so his three-year retreat,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 or all of his four of his three-year retreats were on my trail.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 So he probably had Vajrayana and did a visualizing?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 I don't know the specifics.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 But I was thinking the interesting thing,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 and we already kind of touched on it, is that there's that aspect,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 of course he was in retreat and doing,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 I don't know what practices he was actually doing

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 besides that they were related to my trail,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 but still he was in retreat.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 And then this thing, this moment of compassion that purified him

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 was when he was, of course he was a practitioner,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 but he was out of his retreat.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 He was in the world, interacting directly within his experience

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 with this other actual being right before him on all levels.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 And so the way that, of course based on his practice,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 he had this pure love and compassion

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 that he just naturally did the best thing.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And he thought about it obviously too,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 because he went to town and he bought the knife and came back.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 But maybe there's that aspect too, where it's really actualized,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 where not just, I mean I don't know the degree of his realization before,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 but just that the power of actually engaging with the world,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 with compassion, just that that's such a powerful thing too.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 I mean it was then, that's the moment, I mean it could have been any time,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 but that really brought out his compassion,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 was actually seeing these beings,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 especially the dog who was suffering.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And then it's just a point as far as that,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 as far as there's that action,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 the thing that really purified was this pure moment of compassion

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 that was tangible in a sense.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 It wasn't just thinking about,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 again I don't know what he was practicing in the cave,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 but maybe we have that opportunity.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Of course our formal practice helps us really kind of touch home,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 touch with the freshness and our intention

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 and expand our experience and deepen our meditation,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 so that then as we move into the world and have our day-to-day life

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 and experiences and interactions,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 we're deepening our practice then too,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 based on that kind of nurturing.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 And maybe a lot of that time is also kind of actualizing,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 bringing our practice with everything that we're interacting with.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 This is powerful too, especially with compassion.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 In these circumstances maybe we have less control of what's going on.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 We have a container with our formal practice,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 which is really good to have and good to have that support.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 But then also again there's this aspect when we move out into the world,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 there isn't quite as much control over what we're going to encounter

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 or when we're interacting with other people and beings.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 We're kind of more taking things as they come

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 and actualizing our practice then.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 It benefits the other way as well.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Particularly when you see a lot of suffering out there

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 and you kind of come to this place where,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 I guess from person to person it's different,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 but when you've tried so many things,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 when you've tried to be involved in these things,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 but you don't have the tools that you gain from meditation

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 and you see all of these different ways

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 that people have used for years and years and years.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 We know that war doesn't cause peace.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 We know that anger doesn't bring out kindness.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 We see how we've just been trying for countless aeons

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 and all these other methods.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 It's like, well, what's actually going to work?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 You want kindness, you have to bring that kindness.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Where am I going to find that kindness?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 It has to come out of the practice.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 It has to come out of that mindfulness.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 It brings that fuel because you see how much pain is out there.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 This isn't just for me.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 If it's just for me, I'm going to go get a massage.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 That's where my nice day comes from.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 That's nice.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Maybe I'll go make a brownie or something like that.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 That sounds like a nice way to spend the day,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 but that brownie doesn't help someone else.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Maybe I'll be a little bit nicer after the massage,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 but that's going to last a day.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 What's that lasting thing that actually causes easing of suffering?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 It's the fruit of the practice.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 The post-meditation becomes that fuel

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 and that strong motivation to go back to the cushion.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Yes, definitely.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 It just makes me think too about how they'll talk about

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 and the teachings about the importance of both removing suffering

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 and the cause of suffering.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 What's the cause of suffering?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Ultimately ignorance is the most fundamental cause.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Just thinking about compassion in those terms,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 this compassionate wish to alleviate suffering.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 I can just say on my own, and when I experience someone else's compassion,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 not only am I maybe relieved of whatever suffering

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 might have been there in that moment,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 but there's almost just this inspiration

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 that comes from seeing the other person being so compassionate

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 that I think touches into that cause of suffering too.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 So just reflecting on the power of compassion,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 experiencing compassion on one's own side,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 I think has that two-edged,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 really both relieving that temporary suffering

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 and at least giving a glimpse into the power of,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 "Wow, see what it's like to really act for others' benefit."

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 It's kind of at least starts to steer you there.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 It depends on the action I think and what's happening.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 The motivation could be so strong.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Just getting that taste and saying,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 "Oh, I can offer this to other people."

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 You could be that peace for other people.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 What's the prayer?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 They say, "May I be the doctor in the medicine?"

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 That motivation really just kindles and sparks.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 I was wondering about the meditation.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 You can be kind of bringing up compassion,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 but then I found that sometimes it just becomes a little bit of a lost thought.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 You're maybe being very compassionate,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 but it kind of stops being a meditation

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 and more starts being just thought after thought again.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 What is the practice of keeping in a meditation on compassion

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 as opposed to just thinking on these compassionate thoughts kind of tumbling away?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Just personally, I'm thinking about all the Nuñje practices.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Both the visualizations I can think of

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 are that active attitude of either nourishing

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 or in one of the cases really being that light and really just beaming out.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 So when you're thinking particularly in that case,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 and a lot of the meditations we do, having that focus on the mandala,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 focusing on your visualization itself and maintaining that,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 and of course, like you said, sometimes your mind's going to go,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 "Ooh, burger."

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 It's kind of like a side-track thing.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 But if you keep bringing it back,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 you see it and you just bring it back.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Are you saying that you attach the compassion to the visualization?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 It's not like you have to attach it.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 That attitude of you see the suffering

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 and you know what the suffering does,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and so that natural compassion arises.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 You can't just tap on compassion to something it comes out of.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 When you see the suffering, one of the things about being in samsara

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 is there's no end to the things we can view to give rise to compassion.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 You can see every different type of neuroses.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 You can see so much pain.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 In all of these places, you can see people who look alone,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 who seem distraught, all of these things,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 if you allow yourself to see beyond yourself, they can all give rise to compassion.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 So you don't have to create it.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 You can easily just look, and compassion will spray its sparks.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 So here, in terms of a technical answer,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 if you look at the three frames,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 the three noble ones, for every practice to be a complete practice,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 there's a good beginning, good middle, and good end.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 The good or noble beginning is always establishing the motivation,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 which is refuge in bodhicitta.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 So that's really connecting to that genuine love and compassion in ourselves,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 and also seeing these objects of refuge,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 buddhas and bodhisattvas that have totally fulfilled their own bodhicitta wish

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and become buddhas.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 So that's first, establishing the motivation.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And then second, it's actually the main practice.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 What is it that we're actually continuing in the practice?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 And that's always two-fold.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 So in terms of talking more sutra mayana,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 there's a samatha, or a concentration,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 something we're holding in mind during a practice.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And then there's the vipashana, or the insight side.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And that's actually how flexible our awareness is

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 when we're holding that object.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 So in a way, in vashriyana level,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 that's called a creation stage and completion stage.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 So in terms of meditation and not just getting distracted

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 in a tumbling sequence of thoughts or something,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 just so compassionate and feels so good,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 there's actually a way of applying that in the practice.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And so that's the main noble one, the noble middle.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 And that always has some object we're concentrating on,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 so a concentration aspect.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And then also staying in touch with our awareness,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 or the more open emptiness aspect of our awareness when we do that.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And then the third noble one is always re-affirming

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 that motivation we started with.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So the noble conclusion is making dedication prayers

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 and aspiration prayers.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 So all is a seamless way of bodhicitta

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 being in its more relative and absolute aspects,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 and as a full package for the great Master Long Chambon,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 and of course Kanchipalan Chavarabhichai

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 and Kanchipalan Chavarabhichai

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 have always teach in the context of the three noble ones.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And if we keep it in that context,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 then it really does answer a lot of those questions

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 things kind of being murky, you know?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 There's another way too that he's talked specifically of compassion,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 of like, says visualize your mother, like Oi said,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Patra Rinpoche and Atisha said, visualize your mother.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And Jigme Lingpo said, visualize an animal at the verge of being slaughtered,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 or a sentient being, right, in a really difficult situation.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 And then bring up the fact that they've been so kind to you in the past.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 You know, so vividly see them in front of you,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 and then bring up all that kindness that they've done to you in the past.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 And then think, oh, they've been so kind to me.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 My mother did everything for me, or your father, or your friend.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And then think, oh, I should repay that, like I want to repay that,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 because they're suffering, you know, they're on the verge of slaughter,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 or they're in this difficult circumstances.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Trouble now, trouble in the bardo, trouble in the next life,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 because of all the unvirtuous actions.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So this is so terrible, like,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 and then you do that really vividly, and you have that wish really vividly,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 and you bring up all those different types of suffering.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 And then he says, you know, really cultivate the wish

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 that you yourself will personally take responsibility to bring them out of suffering.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And then apply that, not just to your mother, but to your brothers, your sisters, your friends,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 everyone in the whole infinite vastness of space, all sentient beings.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 You just extend more and more, and then when you get tired, you just rest.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 And you're compassionate.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Like you've got a apostle aspect, you just let go.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 And you always recognize, like Drago was saying too,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 that they're not a for real solid sentient being, you know,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 they say subject, object, action.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 The three aspects are all empty.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 You are empty, they're dreamlike, they're dreamlike,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 and the compassion itself is dreamlike.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 So anyway, that's one specific compassion technique.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 There's just like three aspects of compassion,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 which is, maybe it's what you just went through.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 But that object where compassion for sentient beings is one.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 And then there's thinking about the, on all phenomena.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Yes, that takes sentient beings as a focus.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Right, and then all phenomena, and how all phenomena is impermanent,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 and there's nothing substantially existing.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And then the third aspect is that kind of no focus,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 or like just the complete, maybe more like creation, or completion in a way.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 It's non-conceptual compassion, that's just,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 maybe if anyone has a more clear way of pointing them out.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 It just says, one is like the suffering, so someone's suffering, they're sick.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Two is the, the second can also be said, the cause of their suffering,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 like Amanda was saying, looking what the cause of why they're suffering is,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 and having compassion at that level.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And then third is that natural unconditioned capacity for compassion we have

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 without when we're not restricting our mind in a tighter way,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 or just the natural compassion that arises without limitation,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 all pervasive compassion or something.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 What was the middle one?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Compassion for the cause, or lie, was saying that compassion for phenomena.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 So I think these are three different, they're like two systems looking at compassion.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Or a compassion that takes a dark lot as a focus, that's what it's sometimes translated as,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 looking at the cause of suffering, and the dark light here can mean the dark world,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 or phenomena, or reality, or whatever.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 It's kind of amazing too, you know, we can, we definitely can start

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 with the seeing those very concrete things, and gross things,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 and then the more you experience that compassion, the more fine-tuned your perception can be.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 And then, you know, exactly that progression is.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 You see the gross suffering, you know, when it comes to its full fruition,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 then you see what's causing it.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 And then you realize that, you know, your compassion doesn't have to be sparked by something,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 but it's continually within awareness.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 It's really quite beautiful, very profound.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 There's no corner in samsara that's happy.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Notice there are three types of suffering, the suffering of suffering, suffering of change,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 and all-pervasive suffering.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 The very nature of everything coming together is it's constantly uncertain.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 It always is going to break.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Like literally, there's nothing we ever do in the samsara framework that's happy.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 It's always plagued with instability.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And then really, I think if we get sensitive to that, then the compassion starts really coming

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 strong,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 and that's really too when more of this also like sinking into this emptiness

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 or more flexible, open aspects of compassion is important too.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Because we can't just be overly sensitive and really will kind of drown

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 in the sensitivity to the amazing suffering that's always happening.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.830
 But I think really this is, I mean, two things I thought, and the story is that if we look at a san

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:53.000
gha,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 like he was just, I mean, one of the things I think that this chapter highlights is,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 what didn't a sangha do right?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 For 12 years, what was missing, you know?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Because he was this great scholar at Nalanda.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 He did retreat for 12 years, which, I mean, serious, isolated retreat.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 He had gotten the empowerments, he had gotten the instructions, like everything had lined up,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 but so what was missing?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 And it's really this view or that motivation in terms of Vajrayana context, like you said,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 called the aspiration, so-called Hinayana aspiration, just my own freedom from suffering,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 or freedom of all beings from their suffering, the Mahayana aspiration.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 It just comes down to a view.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 We can do so much work, put in so much time, and that view is really critical.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Both the philosophical way we orient and the heartfelt way that we really feel

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and activate ourselves in that.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Because 12 years, obviously he's purifying and accumulating merit,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 but it really comes down to the view in the end.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And so it says how we start, we really should look at how we start.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 And at the same point, the second thing that was really strong,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 as this is a teaching we hear every time, it's such a fundamental, basic, essential,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 can't do anything without this teaching in Buddhism topic.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And like, it's the basics that make the practice what the practice is.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 You can have all these other things, and without the core, you know,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 it really doesn't work. It really can go really wrong.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Or it can just not really, you know, the result is we fizzle out, you know,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 and we blame the Dharma, and we blame all these things, you know.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 Without that basic core, you know.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 That's the great secret of the Dharma, of the Mahayana.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 The secret the Revachay say at the beginning, every time.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Cultivate compassion. Everyone's like, "Oh, I want the secret teachings!"

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 It's just like, "Here it is! Here's the secret!"

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 If you take that to heart, the whole thing will go totally smooth,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 and that's the secret key that opens everything in the whole Dharma.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 But if you don't, you'll always be on the sidelines.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So I just thought I'd mention, we've been talking so much,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 I didn't give my little cue when we're close to the end,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 but now we're really very close to the end.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 So, in a way, without reading it, we've kind of been touching on this second point here,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 in a part of how what really keeps our practice genuine and complete,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 and not, you know, ensures that our practice isn't just going to kind of be a little rotten.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 And Maitreya, it says Maitreya wasn't being uncompassionate.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.750
 It was really on Asanga's side, his vision, his view, his motivation was being held in a certain

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.000
 way.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 And he said, "Great Master, it should be really noted.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 Asanga is like this pillar of... they say there's two main lineages.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Second turning is Nagarjuna, all this emptiness teachings of the Buddha.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Third turning on all these Buddha nature teachings is this Sangha and Maitreya.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 It's like such a great enlightened being is what his legacy is.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 It's like almost unparalleled, the two beautiful streams of Asanga and Nagarjuna together,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 and this mind only, Madhyamaka, all comes together and we've been handed by Kaparambhiches,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 because it's the same lineage that they hold.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 It's such a great Master, almost unrivaled.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Asanga is so tremendously wonderful.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 And it was this compassion that really, in the end, and then he saw purely,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 is really the quintessential point of this third turning Buddha nature teachings.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 What is the nature of everything?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 It is compassion, and it expresses itself purely balanced ways.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And then you see Maitreya, see things, how Buddha sees things.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 It's really, I mean, Sangha is amazing.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 It kind of goes to like even before every teaching,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 where Vrishas always bring up a course as part of our bodhicitta.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 It's like those two motivations, the way that kind of relates back to,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 but that purely motivation of like really contagion with the bodhicitta,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 and then the motivation of like the vastness view of the purity of all, of everything,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 and of the way those two work together.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And I was thinking another thing that just kind of, I thought of a few times as we were talking,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 but just again kind of on this, the causes and results,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 how Vrishas say many times in many different contexts,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 but if we really like and aspire to like results,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 then we have to love and nurture and connect like even more to the causes of those results.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 And just the way that all relates back to these basic,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 like really essential points that Vrishas are bringing up.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 This makes me feel free.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 For all of us in, never be tired of the virtuous activities

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 and beneficial activities for others.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Only be tired of all the negative things that you've done.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Only be tired of those.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 And then never be tired of continually cultivating that because, you know,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 the mind is so vast and it just keeps going and going and going

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 until you attain enlightenment.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 If you're not enlightened, there's room to grow.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 But for compassion-wise, you know.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 And that's a good point.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 I mean, just, it's so big and that's the nature of our minds too.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 So there's no reason why we can't, you know, expand our view like we both have said.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 All the best wishes for a wonderful new year, 2013.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Thank you.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 By this merit, may all obtain the missions,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 may it defeat the enemy wrongdoing

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 from the strumming waves of earth, old age, sickness and death,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 from the ocean of samsara, may it free all beings.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 The precious bodhicitta and those without it may be generated,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 and those who have it may never diminish,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 but always continue increasing.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Thank you, thank you.
