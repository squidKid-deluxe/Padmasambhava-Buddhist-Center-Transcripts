00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 Take care of the suffering truth, and the suffering truth, and the cause of suffering truth.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.530
 For that, and then Buddha give, those known as the Nainana teachings. Nainana teachings? Oh, you

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.880
 know.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.670
 The Shavaka Jana teachings, Buddha Jana teachings, I will list the names. Many of you know of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.160
 Buddha Jana teachings.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 And Bodhisattva Jana teachings, those are known as, then, the outer three Jana teachings, outer

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 three Jana teachings.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:45.000
 And Shavaka Jana and Buddha Jana are known as, both target as Hin Jana teachings, in terms of the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.880
 basic Buddhism, Buddhist schools teaching, or basic Buddhism teachings.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.720
 And then, third one is Bodhisattva Jana. Bodhisattva Jana is another single name, it's Mahayana's.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.800
 Mahayana.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.190
 And many of you know, I think, the meaning of Bodhisattva. What means Bodhisattva? Bodhisattva is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.880
 Sanskrit word, Bodhi is enlightenment.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.020
 Mine, the sattva is courageous. Courageous one is called enlightenment, or Buddha's. That also

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.400
 indicates that when we are practicing,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.820
 whenever we are practicing zoopshin, whenever we are practicing any practice in the Mahayana

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.880
 practice, we need courage, courage and commitment.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.730
 For that reason here, Buddha sees courageous for the enlightenment, Bodhisattva's. Bodhi is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.880
 enlightenment, sattva is courageous.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 We need courage, commitment, determination, and patience.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:05.960
 Patient is what? Combination of the courage and commitment. You are standing upon the resistance,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.880
 or you are standing,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.880
 finally, any resistance comes, in all different techniques.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.870
 In the samsara, there are so many resistances. When we start doing some good things, activity,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.880
 there is always turbulence.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.580
 Small level, big level, bigger level, very wide level, definitely there is, lot of turbulence comes

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.880
.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 It is going to almost kind of perishing our beautiful attention, beautiful thoughts.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.880
 So, for that reason, we need courage, we need commitment for the enlightenment.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.880
 And then, also, when we start practicing, there are so many inner conveners, again, challenges.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 Mental challenges come, different emotions, different mental states are coming, one after another,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880
 all this,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.880
 and it almost is blowing in hell in our channels, in the channels of the Bodhisattva.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 And challenges, one after another. And all those, sometimes, many times, also in regions, in voice,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 in thinking,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.860
 all practices are not good. I practice it, and this is the kind of making all the discouragement

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.880
 statement,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 and then, kind of, blaming to our practice, what we are doing. That also happens.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.500
 This is what is known as obstacles, hindrance. This is what even the Buddha had, that Buddha is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 what?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:42.880
 He accumulated three countless eons of the merit, in reaching the last level of the 10th vumins.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.880
 Even that's really, when he said, underneath the Bodhi tree, all the different obstacles came up.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.880
 Those are known as the 80 millions Maha. 80,000 millions Mahas began to attack.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.880
 And there is that, because spiritual objects appeared, and soothing, calming world appeared,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.040
 and all spiritual sensory images appeared, one after another, to prevent, and then frighten the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.880
 whole experience,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.880
 and it happened, all that, I mean, you all know that.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.880
 This is obstacles. Have anybody thought that's true, or I should leave, or that's true?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.560
 Even Buddha got the message of your kingdom, and all is destroyed, your wife is robbed by someone

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.880
 else,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 robbed of, even he left kingdom, and your kingdom is destroyed, you should go now.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.880
 Even those words came, those individually, in the teachings said, individuals appeared and sent,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 and given those messages, messages. And somehow, Buddha stopped there, and took those indications

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.880
 as truth,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.880
 Buddha won't become the Buddha, and all that. But however, Buddha continually remained,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.880
 as with courage, he made even statement, right?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.880
 When he sat down under the Bodhi tree, he made the statement, statement,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.880
 and laying a perfectly beautiful, even Victoria grass, on the grass underneath the Bodhi tree,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.010
 and then he sat down on that cushion, with a fragile posture, pressing to the east, and he made the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.880
 statement.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 That in sitting on this cushion, without obtaining my final goal of the realisation,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:45.880
 even my bone is cracked away, even my flesh is dried up, dried up,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.880
 and no matter whatever situation happens, I will never move from this cushion.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.880
 I never move from this cushion. Buddha made that strong statement, strong statement,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.880
 and when he made that strong courage, a commitment statement, in the teachings said,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.880
 the whole universe is beginning to shake, tremble, and at that moment the Mahārāsa,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.500
 what is this happening? Why is this? Then his Mahārāsa soul, so the Buddha is reaching

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.880
 enlightenment.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.880
 And then he did all those obstacles in the teachings.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:33.880
 So that shows, even the final stage of the realisation, in achievement, these obstacles.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.880
 Therefore, we need courage and commitment.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.880
 We should, for those reasons, you need to guide the way and the lives of Bodhisattva.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 How are the teachings, how do you need courage and commitment and determination and patience

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.880
 to really preserve and to bring out your panel goals?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 This is what Bodhisattva means. That is what the meaning of this, Bodhisattva.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.880
 Bodhisattva, the courageous one called enlightenment.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.880
 With the courageous for the enlightenment, then you reach it.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.880
 This is Mahārāsa teachings. Suttara Mahārāsa teaching,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.880
 and many times what is also named causal Mahārāsa teachings. Causal Mahārāsa.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.880
 So now one of the teachings said causal Mahārāsa.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.880
 And what that means, actually. You should think that. What that means.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.880
 Means. Means. And maybe there is something else, Mahārāsa.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.880
 And that Mahārāsa, something else Mahārāsa is the result of Mahārāsa.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.880
 The proof which in Mahārāsa, proof which in Mahārāsa is Vedayana teachings.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.880
 And what it means causal Mahārāsa teaches.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 Causal Mahārāsa is following to reach enlightenment.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.880
 Goal and intention all are the same, both Mahārāsa.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.880
 Whether it is the result Mahārāsa or it is causal Mahārāsa.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.880
 But where you achieve the goal has difference.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 Difference. Direction. Direction is different.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.880
 Causal Mahārāsa teaching said when you reach enlightenment, when you become the Buddha.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.880
 I said, for example, Buddha Shakyamuni in the teaching said three countless eons.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:37.880
 He practiced it. Accumulation married, western married and reaching enlightenment.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.880
 So result of the three countless eons.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.880
 So this is long distance in a very long way that you are walking with cause.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:54.880
 Cause. Therefore it is named as causal Mahārāsa.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.880
 It is just cause to bring enlightenment.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 Result Mahārāsa. Result Mahārāsa is distant level is very quick.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.880
 Now this result Mahārāsa, of course many of you know already.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:22.950
 But who of you don't know? Those are the, again this result Mahārāsa can be divided into six

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.880
 groups.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880
 And fourth three and three three, so second three.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 Fourth three is known as also another name terminology since we are shita, starting the Buddhism.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.880
 And so, again I am going to remind you to you.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.880
 This is the outer three tantra are known as outer tantra or first three tantra outer tantras.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 And second three tantras are the result Mahārāsa and result inner tantras.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 Those are the three, three outer tantra and three inner tantras.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 These are all three, these are the tantras.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.880
 When you practice a tantra practices when you reach enlightenment.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:21.880
 When within Kriya Tantra in the teaching said it takes about sixteen lifetimes, sixteen lifetimes.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:28.880
 And that means, that means in the causal Mahārāsa to reach enlightenment

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.880
 is taking about three countless eons.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:40.100
 Even that one Buddha Shakyamuni said, one who was highly capable, full of skill means courage and

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.880
 commitment.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.490
 Buddha Shakyamuni himself as one of that reaching enlightenment in upper thirteen three countless e

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:48.880
ons.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.410
 And then some of those mediocre courage and commitment continue pursuing same determination with

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.880
 joyful effort when they reach it.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 Seven countless eons, so three countless eons, seven countless eons.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.880
 So it's big difference.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:17.880
 And the very third quality of mediocre capabilities of joyful effort person reaching enlightenment

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.880
 meant in the thirty three countless eons.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.880
 So how much difference that even in causal Mahārāsa that much takes.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.710
 Even the best capabilities such as the Buddha Shakyamuni, he told to reach enlightenment three

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.880
 countless eons.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.880
 But in the day, in that tantra resolved Mahārāsa, Yāna is completely different.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:54.850
 As I said, tantra in the teaching said, Kriya Tantra will take sixteen countless eons, sixteen lif

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.880
etimes, not countless.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.880
 Lifetimes reaching enlightenment.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:09.880
 And then Upa Tantra, second tantra, Kriya Upa, yoga, seven lifetimes.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.880
 Seven lifetimes Upa Tantras.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:22.990
 And yoga tantra, last of the three outer tantras, three lifetimes, those high capabilities can

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.880
 reach enlightenment.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.880
 Why is that?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:39.880
 Because more skillful means more techniques and more courageous.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:53.020
 Courage is more determinations, more acceptance of the old very honest techniques and as well as

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.880
 teachings begin to apply.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:01.880
 And for that reason, what is the famous suttara, not suttara, tantra commentary, system romance.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:13.060
 And they said, tantra teaching is not just only holding on one direction, it's not just below by

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.880
 one meaning.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:24.190
 And many more skillful means, more skillful means is highly developed, highly couple of

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.880
 practitioners.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:33.880
 And for this, these three theories, Vajrayana teaching is the past ones.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:40.880
 And what means that one, not blocked by one meaning,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:49.230
 you're not kind of holding only one guru, such as Mahayana teaching, one guru, who is composed of

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.880
 emptiness.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.880
 The great Mahashananda Realization. Mahashananda.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:00.850
 But in the Vajrayana teaching, it is empty, it is also appeared as a token as a border

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.880
 enlightenment status.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.880
 Border enlightenment, for that reason, Vajrayana teaching often chose three versions.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.880
 Vajrayana poem, Vajrayana song, Vajrayana mind.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:21.850
 It's both are, for example, all, everything is enlightened, not just only focused on one direction

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.880
 of the Mahashananda or great emptiness.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.880
 You also bring together exactly where things are.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.350
 The things there is, absolute truth, relative truth, not just only focused on absolute truth, but

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.880
 relative truth.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.880
 Relative truth is enlightened, absolute truth is enlightened.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:47.570
 Border in the union status, bring that realization clearly as it is and therefore is not just

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.880
 blocked by the one who's part.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.880
 And then all the skillful means in Vajrayana teaching is.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:00.170
 What are the skillful means in teaching? Poets which use simple things, about mantras, about

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.880
 meditation, about the channel,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:08.180
 about the wind, about the essence, the element of the mind, and as well as also the essence, the

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.880
 element of the bodies.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.880
 All the soul, this is just how I'm talking, uses small things.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:21.880
 There's so many varieties of the techniques that all lead, all designed, all focused, activated,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880
 glorified,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.880
 energy, natural called as it is.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.980
 And then of course to handle that, to handle that, Vajrayana practicing, highly capable at

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.880
 intelligent beings.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:42.370
 That means courage level, commitment level, level and determination level, and accepting openness

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:42.880
 levels

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.880
 and devotion level, everything is high capabilities.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.880
 Highly capabilities, devotion, joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, all these things.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.960
 And because you're full of them, everything is kind of like shimmering state of the inner qualities

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.880
 of them.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.880
 Then the Vajrayana teaching when you practice, then it comes, it comes.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:14.880
 What's called win-win situation, embrace that realization, past.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.880
 Therefore, Vajrayana teaching is known as resolved Mahayana, embrace realization so fast.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.230
 Then when we talk about the like, in other, in other countries, such as Mahayoga, Anuya, Ati, or

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.880
 Thanas,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.880
 by these practice of the three, inner thanra bring enlightenment within these lifetimes.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.880
 Within these lifetimes, for look that, to read the life story of all those great masters,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.570
 such as 25 disciples and Gaurabhammas, the practice of inner thanra, thanra practice, reach

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.880
 enlightenment, all that.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:02.580
 And then within, even they just said within, within lifetime, all three years, seven years, twelve

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:02.880
 years,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.880
 all those are also really named and upper thanra.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:11.500
 We have the courage and commitment and determination, devotion and joy and appreciation with joyful

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:11.880
 effort.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.880
 And we really practice as the teachings, really we can make the change, change.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.440
 And for those reasons, even Dokkitaji, many times they said, well, you're sitting down on the

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:24.880
 cushion,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.880
 you can be only beings, but where you get up from the cushion, you are Buddha.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.880
 So, sit back, live with them, really.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.410
 Sitting down, by sitting down, during that time, when you're sitting down, you are little sentient

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:39.880
 beings

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.880
 and you sit hour, whatever, hour, and then you get up, you are Buddha.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:53.160
 You walk out with Buddha, sit down with the sentient beings, walk out with Buddha, even Dokkitaji

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.880
 said that.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.880
 So, that's what they really do, Dokkitaji.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:05.880
 So, their sense of enlightenment comes so fast, for that reason, is named as Risul Janas.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.880
 And I think I'm going to start.
