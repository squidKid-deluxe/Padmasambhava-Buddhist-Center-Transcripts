00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400
 The word is "Dengtotokota" in Tibetan. "Dengtotokota" is a Tibetan word, which means, again, it is

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.600
 confidence.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.940
 So that means, now you recognize, you also appreciate, recognize the atrocity or you had great

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.600
 confidence.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.070
 Now you've built up the great fearless confidence, unshakable confidence and going to liberate

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.600
 everything as it comes.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 Going to take care of everything, not going to crush us by the delusions.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 We are going to crush you or we are going to liberate everything. How are we going to liberate?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 We need confidence, confidence under our will, will. We need confidence in the will.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 Everything is now ruppa, ruppa status. All the display is ruppas. Everything is ruppa.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 When you have that confidence, that fearless, unshakable confidence, then whatever we go through,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 we are going to take care of that within that nature state without hurting our self.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 That is known as "Dengtotokya". "Dengtotokya". This "Dengtotokya" we mentioned yesterday, many

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.600
 times.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 This is all, of course, all the teachings mentioned again and again.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.250
 This is what, again, this "Dengtotokya" is liberating. It is mainly in, of course, both meditations

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.600
 state, both meditations state.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:57.330
 Both we have to be liberated. What we are liberating, actually? The emotions or the disturbance or

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.600
 the grassroots.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 And also this liberating and delusion, both are not in ruppa.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.370
 Ruppa state is, or the zoopi nature of the mind is free from the liberation, free from the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.600
 delusions.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 This liberation and delusion, liberated delusions, all is within the territory of the conceptions.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 What we are liberating is fine. The nature of zoopi is free from that, free from that.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.460
 So now, when we are deluded, when we are engaged in the world, or when we are practicing meditating

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.600
,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 generally there is two kind of like handiness that we can occur, or counter to occur.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.600
 During the meditation, the emotions can arise, all the different emotions arise.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.310
 Emotions can arise, such as we went yesterday, the great master mentioned too, Shyapa Soronara

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.600
 mentioned too.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 The experience of the blissfulness, experience of the clarity, experience of the neutral thoughts.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 Those are also the spirit of the thought, emotions.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.810
 The emotions are not just only this thought, emotion generally in the zoopi teaching says there is

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.600
 at least two emotional thoughts can come.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 Smooth experience and rough experience.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 Smooth experience of the feeling, smooth experience of the clarity or the blissfulness,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.940
 or the blissfulness of course is the blissfulness, but smooth experience, something related with

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.600
 smooth experience,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 also there is rough experience comes, rough experience.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 And then clarity experience also has smooth aspect and rough aspect.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 And neutral thought also has rough experience and smooth experience.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.830
 So there is those great masters in the teaching said there is true experience that we can go

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.600
 through.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.290
 And generally speaking, or however we are speaking, what is this experience? Experience whether it

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.600
 is smooth, whether it is rough, rough, both are good.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 Means we are meditating, it is working, something.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.600
 But however, when it is reflected to our senses, it has different effect.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Smooth and rough, rough, smooth experience such as the bliss level is the blissfulness.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 It is so nice, something that we want, wanting, wanting or wish to have that.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 That is smooth experience.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.960
 And rough experience is suddenly get emotional, rolling course of the emotions, rolling course, or

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.600
 heavy kind of emotion.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 It is so sad, suffering, suddenly kept sad, suffering.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.600
 All kind of will have got more emotion, the anger, or something.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 No reason, something and a deep rest, kind of all that things comes.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.600
 Those are also known as the like rough experiences.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 It is all blissful experience, smooth experience and bliss experiences.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 Both are display of the mind.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 And both are part of the delusions.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 And what we do, what we have to do?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 This and then second is, second is clarity.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.600
 Clarity experiences are kind of soft clarity experience, such as very clear, brilliant.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 Mind is become kind of very open and relaxed.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 And your kind of intelligence looks like also really kind of shiny, more smart, more intelligent,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.900
 more kind of like words, what you use become more kind of clear, strong, looks like so nice and all

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.600
 these things.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 Those are known as clarity experiences.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 And then both stronger ones, even see through the walls or see some things.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 All kind of like detected so many kind of like things that before we don't know,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:39.600
 but now it's coming up more in sport like, sport like those kind of smooth experience.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.600
 And the rough experiences become again, more emotions, more rough and seeing things kind of clearly

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600
, a little bit bit,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 but this is more irritating now, give more irritation, more kind of become more sensible.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 You picking up so many unnecessary things, picking up that by the eye, by the ear, by the nose,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 by tongue, by the body, kind of picking up a lot of things unnecessary

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 and become attached, clinging onto that and become disturbance, disturbance.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 Those are known as rough experience of clarity.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.940
 And then smoother experience of the neutral, neutral or no thought, then become more calm, more

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.600
 peaceful.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.650
 Kind of more, your mind is become a little bit stable, more stable, stable and kind of also you

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.600
 like to meditate.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.600
 Kind of like become very, kind of very slow and very, very kind of subtle things.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 Those are the smooth experience of the neutral.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 And then also rough thoughts such as then, as more kind of dullness.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600
 More, before you kind of know a lot of things, quite okay this day, but now suddenly looks like

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 mind is become more dull, more kind of poggy

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 or more sleepy, more kind of like heavy, heavy, these things.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.600
 Those are known as rough experience of the simple.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.600
 Now all of this, what is all this is?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 As I said in the teaching, it is all good sign.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.600
 Good sign, whether it is rough, whether it is smooth, your practice is working.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
 But that is really good.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 But however, if we code with these emotions, then we are now falling back to the samsara

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 or going to fall back to samsara.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 Therefore, what we have to do?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 With great confidence, you already know the will,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 you already know like what is rappa is.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.600
 You also see rappa is embodying everything.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 Rappa cannot be diluted or this primordial person or rappa cannot be diluted by object, by subject.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.600
 No matter what is happening, it is not going to change anything.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.600
 Re-spend your confidence, re-spend our understanding of zokki teaches.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 Zokki teaches, then we are going.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 This is the time we are going to play technique of that liberated tells.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 Why are we going to liberate all those delusions?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 Whatever it is, we are not going to hold and code with that.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 That is known as liberating.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 Thank you.
