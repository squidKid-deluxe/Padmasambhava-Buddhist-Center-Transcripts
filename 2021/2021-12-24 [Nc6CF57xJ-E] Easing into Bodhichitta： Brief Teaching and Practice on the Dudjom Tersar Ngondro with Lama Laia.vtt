00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 The wheel of Dharma, always turning, ever resounding, the outreaching display of compassion of the

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 true nature beyond past, present, future, the very essence of things. How beautiful we can

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 be together, actually together, in honor and love for that. So just as usual, as we begin,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.240
 any study, any contemplation, any practice or activity, just really reflecting on our joy,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 appreciation, really these four thoughts, how precious our situation is, to kind of really

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.800
 just, again, take a peek at our situation. How precious we're free of so many

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 circumstances and endowed with so many good conditions and qualities.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.120
 And then, of course, impermanence,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:21.920
 and some glimmer of the natural law of karma, cause and effect, result, causes and conditions.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 And then, of course, samsara, our samsara,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.040
 everyone's samsara. There's really, to whatever degree, that big ocean, just looking at suffering

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:53.440
 and its causes, kind of really feeling more and more in our heart, how samsara isn't reliable.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:05.120
 Recall, of course, the wanderers is another word for samsara beings in the Buddhist teachings.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.120
 We're all wandering, looking for just the right space, running from the wrong place,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:22.170
 trying to find the right place. But, of course, we know eventually we come to realize a little more

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.480
,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.880
 there's nowhere to go.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 That's what the Buddha is pointing out in the Four

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.000
 Noble Truths, the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, but more importantly,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.080
 beyond and transcending what's more reliable is that our nature is free of suffering

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:00.960
 naturally, and that there is a path to awakening that. So, of course, just

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.840
 spending time with that, it's always pointed out, so important to reflect on those thoughts.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.760
 And again, with love and devotion, feeling the presence of the lineage masters,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.200
 and we're doing this nundra practice, which again, it's the essence of all the teachings,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 all the practices within Buddhism, and within our tradition, which holds all nine vehicles,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.000
 the full spectrum of study and practice of the Buddhist teachings is what's come

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.560
 to us, and that we have this beautiful karmic connection with in the nundra practices.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.160
 Like Kimpo Sei Wong Rinpoche says, they're not only the foundation, they're the central column

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.600
 of our practice. If every building or structure needs a good foundation, it also needs strong

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:13.200
 support, you know, a backbone. And in fact, it's every part of the great, you know, cathedral.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.320
 Nundra is everything. And we have these beautiful, concise practices to do, and contemplate,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.120
 and a place to kind of let all of the teachings we've heard in the past, all of, you know,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.240
 whatever kind of thoughts and understandings and comprehension we've had with that can land in our

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.320
 nundra practice. And then of course, practicing and taking it to heart, really savoring the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 instructions, you know, they say like a mute person who's very hungry, you know, just savoring

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:05.680
 delicious food. Really giving ourselves the time to practice is so vital and so important,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.520
 no matter how big it is, it's quality, right, not quantity. And then having reflected a little on

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.400
 these thoughts with big bodhicitta, that, you know, just the thought that remembering we're doing

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.560
 this,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.520
 not just for ourselves, but for all beings, just really spreading our minds and hearts to that.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.720
 And connecting with this purity of this moment. That's the essence of everything we're doing.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.520
 So that's why it's always important to begin with that. And then the nundra practices themselves

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:53.760
 are all of that. And so we've done some discussion on the four thoughts with some

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.200
 kind of been talking a little bit on the taking refuge, the three jewels and like

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.600
 Kim Po Se Wong, Don Joe Rinpoche gave such a beautiful teaching last weekend,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:14.800
 really pointing out so beautifully how Guru Padmasambhava is the embodiment of

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.320
 all the three jewels, the three roots, three kyas. So we take refuge

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.240
 with that great kind of trust that's ever expanding, ever growing, which means also again

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:40.880
 in our own goodness qualities, we have trust. And that's why we're taking the three jewels,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 the three roots, the precious lama as our guide to awaken our own goodness qualities and be able

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.280
 to be truly of benefit for others. Because until we do, I guess we're just confused.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:08.800
 And then the second part of of nundra, the second section, of course, is our bodhicitta.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:20.560
 So there's so much can be said about bodhicitta. And but as bodhicitta is the heart essence

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:31.600
 of all the Buddhist teachings in general, but very specifically brought out the these teachings

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.480
 in the Mahayana teachings, which naturally are foundations for the Vajrayana teachings.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:49.440
 And what are what is bodhicitta? What is Mahayana? You know, the view here, right, is

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.000
 everything is mind.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:10.880
 Mind is empty, radically empty beyond all extremes. I mean, this is kind of the view

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.560
 that we're becoming more and more aware and having more and more in our awareness,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:29.920
 the vast openness of our situation, and having more and more of an open heart.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.920
 And then, of course, loving kindness is also inseparable from that.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:45.840
 So the bodhicitta really comes down to, again, wisdom, knowing things as they are,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:09:00.960
 open, empty, vivid, and engendering a kind heart. That's how Patra Rinpoche really sums it all up.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.400
 We can have all kinds of grand, really beautiful explanations and beautiful lists that help us

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:16.480
 remember all the great qualities and things to remember. Having a kind heart and an open mind

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:24.880
 and heart is the essence of, really, our bodhicitta practice. And I'm not going to talk a whole lot

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.520
 today, but maybe just give a little brief review, and these are all things I know are nothing new

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:43.200
 to anybody. But bodhicitta, we often think of bodhicitta while it is about having a kind heart

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:52.560
 and wanting to benefit others. It's really understanding that the only way we can really

00:09:52.560 --> 00:10:02.800
 help others is through waking up, and increasing our wisdom and understanding more and more and

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.040
 more.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:11.920
 Bodhi is enlightenment. Chitta is the heart or the mind.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:21.280
 Those who are working to awaken that in themselves for the benefit of others and helping others

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.480
 are those who are courageous for enlightenment. It means it's not always easy.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:35.600
 Why? Because we are samsara beings. We're all confused. We all have ignorance. We all have

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.440
 aversion. We all have attachment and all the other things. We're purifying those things.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:49.920
 We're releasing those things. We're bringing out our innate wisdom, our innate compassion,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:59.360
 our Buddha nature. But really, taking that to heart and remembering that for ourselves,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.920
 being kind with ourselves with that is so vital and important.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:17.040
 First too, then we have as far as the aspiration to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:26.160
 beings. We have these two basic things that the Buddha gave us to really begin to take that into

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.440
 our heart. I know we've all heard this, right? The four boundless or four immeasurables

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:42.720
 and the six paramitas. The four immeasurables are there. The four immeasurables are what are

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:53.040
 immeasurable boundless love, immeasurable boundless compassion, immeasurable boundless

00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:01.680
 joy, rejoicing, immeasurable boundless equanimity or impartiality.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:17.770
 Those are the things that we call more aspirational bodhicitta. If we can truly really take the

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.080
 time

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:30.800
 to engender a mind of loving kindness and concern and really actually feel tangibly

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:39.520
 our love, our wish that beings be free of suffering and its causes, including ourselves,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.600
 including those we have challenges with,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:52.400
 but have happiness and all of its causes, be free of suffering and all of its causes,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:00.560
 rejoice in all the fulfillments, temporary and supreme, finding peace

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:12.240
 and that everyone could be impartial. So within the four boundless, they're called boundless

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.960
 because of this fourth one, impartiality or equanimity,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:27.680
 means that we're not reserving our love and our compassion and rejoicing in others'

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:37.600
 fulfillments only for a select group, but for everyone, everywhere in our life, beyond our life,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:45.280
 but really not having that just be lip service or a little ramble in our head, but really taking

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:58.640
 that to heart so that impartiality is so really vital. So, you know, like the teachings say,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:07.760
 really spending, taking time to really just open our minds and hearts to thinking how we're all

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:18.720
 equal. We're all in the same boat. We all have the same beautiful nature and potential for

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:27.360
 peace and awakening and joy that's free of clinging and misunderstanding, hope and fear,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:39.360
 this naturalness. We all have that potential and we're all in the same boat that while we all have

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.320
 that same potential and same nature, we don't understand it or see it in different degrees.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.560
 We're all confused, you know.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:01.040
 And so, of course, just opening, thinking of those we do know and love, wishing them happiness

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:09.040
 and its causes, but spreading that out, really thinking of those that we have challenges with.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:20.800
 There's all kinds of ways we can think about that, but maybe at some point they, we had good

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.720
 relations with them either in this life or another life. Maybe the people we love in this life or

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:37.120
 another life we've had challenges with in the past have even been, who knows, mortal enemies with,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:45.680
 you know? These are the teachings. This is impermanence. Things change. We all want happiness.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.160
 But so it's really just trying to spread that, thinking of those we have challenges with,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:03.440
 at least trying to see how we can have another way, how they want happiness too.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:16.000
 Just spreading that. Because it's really that impartiality that's going to really

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.680
 spread and just increase, using that as the foundation to really increase our true wish

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:33.040
 for others to have happiness and its causes, really have that love expand and truly be impartial.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:49.040
 And our compassion, or ningjie, have our heart really wish that people be happy and be free of

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:59.200
 any suffering and truly rejoice in everyone's fulfillments. If we really have this as a truly,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.680
 just an inclination that's more and more natural and more and more part of our experience and our

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:14.640
 wishes by actually seeing how we're all equal and just pointing our mind in the direction of our

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.320
 love and compassion and joy for others, as our children, as our friends, as our mothers and as

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.360
 our fathers, all sentient beings. If we have that inclination, then we're more engaged to really

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.480
 bring out our own bodhicitta and then that's the six paramita practices. And similar to the four

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:48.400
 boundless, where it's equanimity or impartiality that makes all the four boundless boundless,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:58.720
 it's the sixth paramita that makes all the others transcendent and truly beneficial.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.720
 That's because what is the sixth is increasing our wisdom,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:17.280
 seeing things as they are, our awareness beyond concepts, and then also just understanding things

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:26.240
 as they are relationally, is going to make us more and more informed as we engage and develop

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.600
 and perfect these other paramitas which what are doing what again, they're just uprooting our ego

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:42.480
 clinging our aversion, our attachments, where we're hung up and snagging, creating more trouble for

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:50.080
 ourselves and others, whether we know it or not, or like it or not. So the practice of generosity,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:19:00.640
 just an open giving mind and heart of pure conduct or morality, just being more and more

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.480
 sensitive to what's appropriate or inappropriate in all the different situations we find,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.880
 which especially in this world we all know can be challenging.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.120
 We all come from so many different backgrounds and cultures.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.480
 There's just a lot, so becoming more and more sensitive to that, refraining from what's

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:31.760
 disruptive and upsetting, engaging more in what's nurturing and balancing and uplifting,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.760
 that's morality.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:45.280
 Having more patience means dealing with our uprooting our frustration and our anger when

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:53.440
 things aren't going the way we think they should, but trying to be more understanding and accept

00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:02.240
 things as they are, in situations as they are, ourselves as we are, others as we are,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:13.120
 and then joyful effort and not being distracted, developing our concentration with our wisdom.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.640
 So then, of course, it's all easy to say and it starts right now, but really in the teachings,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:29.760
 these six paramitas, that's the whole moving through all the 10 bhoomis, even through the

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:39.360
 five paths. At least I'm just a little beginner, but even all the great bodhisattvas are perfecting

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.560
 these paramitas. It just becomes more and more transcendent, more and more perfect, more and

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:53.600
 more natural. So I'm just trying to give a quick little overview of these two things and we can

00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:01.040
 explore them a little bit more in the future. And of course, there's so many great teachings

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:08.800
 on these things and we've also heard them, but as we all know, it's really taking these things to

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:19.280
 heart, relaxing, absorbing, really being with what the teachings awaken in our minds and hearts and

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:29.440
 keeping with it is so important and so vital no matter what happens. Ups, downs, goods, bads,

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:43.280
 troubling. Just keep going, keep practicing. So that's all I'm going to say for now.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:49.360
 And we'll enjoy this time to really practice together. So thank you. Thank you for your

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:56.720
 patience in listening to this a little bit. I hope it's helpful. And again, I'll say really,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:03.680
 if people have any questions or anything like that they want to kind of know more about or clarify,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:13.360
 please do feel free to write in or call or there's people in the room too. So everyone's included

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:13.520
 in

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:27.760
 that. So thank you and now we'll just do a little practice. So.
