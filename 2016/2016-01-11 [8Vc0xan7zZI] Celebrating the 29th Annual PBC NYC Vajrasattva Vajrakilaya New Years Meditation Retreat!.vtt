Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche!\n\nJanuary 2, 2016\n\nNew Year's 2016 Vajrasattva & Vajrakilaya Practice for Healing, Removing Obstacles, & Fulfilling All Wishes\n\nDedicated to harmony in this country and to world peace.\n\n\"The Vajrasattva fire puja practice mainly focuses on pacifying negativities and obstacles while increasing prosperity, joy, longevity, peace, and bodhichitta realization. This is one of the rare terma of Minling Terchen and practiced widely by all the Nyingma lineage.\n\nVajrakilaya is the embodiment of all the buddhas\u2019 activities and is one of the most famous practices of the Nyingma school. Practicing on Vajrakilaya removes our obstacles, eases the flow of Dharma activity, and reveals the Buddha nature. Daily practice of Vajrakilaya is suggested as it is very powerful. Practice on special occasions is also very beneficial.\"\n\nJanuary 1, 2, & 3, 2016\n222 Bowery \u2022 NY, NY 10012\n(between Prince & Spring)\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",
