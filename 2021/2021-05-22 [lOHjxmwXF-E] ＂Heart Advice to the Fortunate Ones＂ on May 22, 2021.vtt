00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.340
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much for your participation. Thank you again.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.720
 Making time and getting participating is a lot of time and effort and organizing, and I'm very

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.540
 thankful.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:25.340
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, we are continuing to follow and come to the touch to the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.340
 teaching of our gracious, kindness, compassion teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, which is that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 this one individual can summarize, condense in very practical way, to put in a simple way

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 so that we all can release somebody, some can carry our own path in practice as a day

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 to day, and also remind it to us. That's what His Holiness, the new day, in this one beautiful.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 It's simple, it's short, but yet it really carries every essence. All baggage, our essence

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 baggage of the practice that you need is on our trail of joy and happiness to the path,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.340
 to the enlightenment. These ingredients, every key, borrowed our journey of the trail to the path

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 or to the path of enlightenment, it is excellent. It really carries, condense everything.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 You read this, and everything it tells us, from the force of the Buddha's teaching, such as known

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 as Pundarajan teaching of the Buddha, now all the way to the Durya at your teaching,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 it is a condensate, something, a nugget teaching that we can apply. We are trying to do that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 teaching. Which is our practice? It's not something that new idea we are learning today,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 or some completely kind of different thing. We are reactivating our practices, that's what we know

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.770
 in a very beautiful way, so we can remember this. Remember this every day, or every time our

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.340
 practices,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.340
 or along the path, we can remember. So this is what it is. So it's so special.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 And therefore again, then the Buddha teaching, and old, and then being as a beautiful human being,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 all those reasons bring up the joy and appreciation, and that is so important.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.670
 And as I said many times, it's not just important, but those are the foundational, very

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.340
 foundational

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 of the Buddha teaching and our practices. We practice with joy and appreciation, and thankful,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.340
 very cordial. Really, that's it. Every reason we have, every reason, you can think, reflect it,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 and collectively think, "Why I have to have you with joy and appreciation?"

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.340
 Being a human being, and as well as all the other reasons that you need,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 go through your check, not books, as Buddha taught, or teaching taught,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.340
 with those great marks and say, "Just check, really, we have so many reasons to be happy and joy,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.340
 even though we are in a samsara. Of course, we are in a samsara.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.340
 We have so many difficult challenges going on and on, but in the midst of those tribulations,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.340
 we have great hope and vision, light, that we can care of ourselves, sustain ourselves,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.340
 and move forward with vision and goal." How wonderful. That is known as courageous moving,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.340
 bodhisattvas, courageous for the enlightenment. Not that they did not say Buddha did not say

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.340
 timidness for the enlightenment, courageous for the enlightenment.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.340
 We have to courage and enlightenment to discover our true nature.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.340
 Truth, it is very, very challenging sometimes, but it is rewarding forever.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.340
 It is not that going to ask fail or fall down. It is so special.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.340
 Therefore, we have all the tools, closely, very far away, that everything is in our sight,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.340
 in our way. How wonderful, how beautiful it is.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.340
 Really, therefore, with joy and appreciation and happiness.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 And together, we did bodhisattva, extending that joy and appreciation,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 with love and kindness and compassion for all living beings,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 as we learn, as we receive the teachings, as we practice, extend.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.340
 Then, together with purity, realization, as very analytic, always highlighting.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 Yes, that is not just very analytic, but that is our ultimate goal,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.340
 to become as everything enlightened.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.340
 When the bodhisattva comes to reach enlightenment, not just he reaches enlightenment himself,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 but the entire universe is. For him, he is enlightened.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.340
 Not just he is sitting in the middle of the evidence, the frivolous state,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.340
 but on his weakness, on his realization.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.340
 The whole, everything, whole, total, everything is enlightened.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 Home, soul, space, mind, everything, totally awake status.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.340
 That is known as totally enlightenment.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.340
 Partly the enlightenment, final goal of our journey of the enlightenment,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.340
 over the whole. And that, again, for the very end of practicing,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.340
 we begin right now, not waiting for a long time to become that.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.340
 It begins, that dawn of that purity begins right now.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.340
 Dawn, or light. It begins right now.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.340
 That also, how that happens, Buddha gives those teachings,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.340
 great masters give those teachings, but we have to activate it.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.340
 Enlightenment is more personal, in a way. We have to activate it.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.340
 That is our job, our responsibilities. We have to enlighten.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.340
 We are not going to be waiting to be enlightened by so much,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.340
 never going to happen, according to Buddhism.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.340
 You have to walk for your enlightenment.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.340
 And that begins right now, with those goals,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.340
 and then again we move to these teachings.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
 Teaching or activating those visual motivations, visual intentions,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.340
 and we move to this one.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.340
 And here, great master, his Holiness, Dhunurumudjib.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.340
 Dhunurumudjib said, whole, everlasting treasures,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.340
 whatever lasting treasure of practitioners that he highlighted,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.340
 that means we should always keep this poor, activated, that means.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.340
 It really means that we don't have, but we have to activate it.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.340
 We are not going to put our sight in the corner,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.340
 or somewhere in the wake, or in the distance, or in visible ways.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.340
 We have to activate it. What are those?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.340
 Again, Ami is here, he supports a lot.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.340
 I mean, last line of this quote, post-veg, devoting to the root teacher.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.340
 Root teacher.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.340
 And then love and affection for Samayas, brothers and sisters.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.340
 That's two.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.340
 And bodhicata of conviction towards all mother sent in the beings.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.340
 That is three, or three, wealth, three wealth, or wealth.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:59.340
 And the reduction of grasping due to the knowledge that all compounded things are impermanent.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:05.340
 This is the four everlasting treasures.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.340
 Every have these four, every keep that close to our heart,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.340
 we will be always good practitioners.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.340
 Not just good practitioners, we are very full of graceful practitioners,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.340
 advancing practitioners.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.340
 Our practice is not going to stay as dominion, what's called sleek mood.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:34.340
 It is fully working, and it is engaging, energetic, moving forward,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.340
 developing, being, purifying our obscurations, accumulating merit.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.340
 Really we are advancing to the part.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.340
 We are going to advance in the path of all those Buddha teachings said,

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.340
 five path, ten movements, we are going to advance.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:57.340
 One after another, this is wealth, this wealth become more richer,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:03.340
 richer, stronger, and stronger than what in many times in many other teachings,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:11.340
 opening the trail of skies, the endless treasures that we are really going to open.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:19.340
 All the luxuries, bundles, spur of spirit, joy and peace and happiness,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:26.340
 as all opening with love and compassion, courage and commitment and confidence,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:33.340
 those are really just kind of rushing, just out, rushing, really welcome.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.340
 That is known as wealth.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.340
 This wealth, as I said the other day, I mean you all know,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.340
 this is not going to leave behind us when we leave this wall.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:50.340
 This wealth, we will trade with us, wherever we go.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.340
 As Buddha teaching the part of in the next life,

00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:01.340
 it will go on and on and expanding, more flourishing, flourishing, flourishing.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.340
 Really this will happen.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.340
 So those are like what poor wealth, as we were last time.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:15.340
 Last time, the first one we went through and what we said devoted to the teacher,

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.340
 so we went on why we feel the devotion.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.340
 The qualification of something worthwhile to be devoted,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.340
 those we went through according to Buddha teaching,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.340
 explained and went through the Vinaya level,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.340
 we went to the Bodhisattva level or as teaching taught,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.340
 we went as very analytic.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.340
 Then we filled devotion.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:45.340
 We filled Namaskar, Peh, F-A-I-T-H, Peh and the devotion.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.340
 Devotion is so important in the teaching sense

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.340
 that devotion is the really taught, it depends on our achievement also too.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.340
 But in the teaching sense, all those great master in life stories,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.340
 our realization is measured by the devotions

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.340
 or the blessings of the Buddha Dharma Sangha

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.340
 or is measured by our own duty of the devotions.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:21.340
 And we have small devotions, we have small blessings or small achievements.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.340
 We have quite medium devotions, we have medium blessings and medium realizations.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:34.340
 We have big devotions, then we have big realizations

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.340
 and big achievements and big blessings.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.340
 So that's in all the teachings, if you read those many great books,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.340
 such as like words of my teacher and some other books,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.340
 really in the teaching sense,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:57.340
 that realization and achievement is dependent upon the duty of our devotions.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:06.340
 And our confidence, our commitment is not just that, it's commitment.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.340
 So therefore, devotion is so important.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.340
 But if we have all the others, these two portrayal of those three,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.340
 all target, devotion comes naturally.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:26.340
 You see value and importance and this goodness and benefit of the teachers

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.340
 and the teachings and the lineage, devotion comes naturally.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:38.340
 And devotion is a combination of joy and appreciation and confidence

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:44.340
 and freshness or appreciation, richness.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.340
 That is a combination of the devotions.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.340
 When you have these devotions, we begin to settle down to our practices.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.340
 We're not going to become the gift seal of the spirituals.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.340
 We're not going to become the wanderers and again mover, goer all the time,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.340
 goer, going, going, going.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.340
 We are settled at that moment.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.340
 We begin, from that on, we begin to grow, develop.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.340
 Generally in the Buddha teaching, we say things are named as goer.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.340
 Dua in it, very teaching.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.340
 Dua means something is moving all the time.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.340
 We move, we go.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.340
 Larger level, small level, we eat the level.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.340
 We're really moving, never going to stay.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.340
 We don't start doing our spiritual practices, like going all the time,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:42.340
 moving, like jumping as grasshoppers, kangaroos, kangaroos.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.340
 Jumping all the time, we're never going to settle.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.340
 Settle.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.340
 When we're not settled, we're not rooting.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.340
 And how we can grow, develop, jump all the time.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.340
 But when you have the devotion,

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:06.340
 and the devotion is joy, appreciation, confidence, and,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.340
 and reach this feeling of the lineage and teaching,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.340
 then really we settle.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.340
 Settle.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.340
 That moment, it really started developing, growing, rooting,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.340
 plant is rooting.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.340
 Our spiritual bodhicitta, root, is now rooting,

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.340
 not shaking the root all the time.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.340
 And trembling, moving all the time, changing root all the time.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.340
 Even this plant, the plant is water, the plant,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.340
 that we change all the time, both.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.340
 Moving all, it won't grow.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.340
 Grow.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.340
 In short time.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.340
 Time is not going to wet us.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.340
 Time is, this is perfect time.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.340
 We have to let it grow.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.340
 Let it develop.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.340
 Let is nourish, nourish.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:04.340
 Therefore, this, this movie is so important, important,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.340
 and to the root teachers.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.340
 And the root teachers generally, as you mentioned,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.340
 generally all the teachers, all those who have been kindness to us,

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.340
 from the beginning time, when we were growing, baby times or young times,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.340
 until now, we should respect all the earners many times in the teaching.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.340
 But the teaching is all the earners, the earners of the knowledge,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:35.340
 that who help us, nourish and grow and develop something really to show the world,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.340
 something that made us more practical, more sensible,

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.340
 with more common sense they give us.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.340
 All is respected.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.340
 We respect everyone.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.340
 And then by regularly, then, teaching that we are really now,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.340
 cultivating and developing, then we have to be to devotion.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.340
 So those are really about this first one.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:03.340
 And the second one is love and effort with a smile, brother and a sister.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.340
 This is, in a Tibetan, I don't have to read, but this is,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:15.340
 this is, brother and a sister, and she, in a Tibetan, she is brother and sisters,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.340
 so that we should always have love and affections

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.340
 to all our regular brother and sisters,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.340
 and particularly his Samaya brothers.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.340
 What means Samayas? They are generated.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:36.340
 This Samaya means one who, we are all sharing the same practices,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:43.340
 same meditation, and that is really called bonded Samayas.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:50.340
 Generally, in the Buddha teaching, when we go for the teachings,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:57.340
 we are, for example, all of us, all of us have similar Samayas,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.340
 all of them particularly very unpractical.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.340
 We all have similar Samayas.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.340
 And those Samayas, according to Vedayana teaching,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:14.340
 we are the keeper of the three different vows, three different vows.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:20.340
 Those vows are known as like individually vows or pati moksha vows.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.340
 And the second is bodhisattva vows.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.340
 The third is Vedayana vows.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:37.340
 All the Vedayana practitioners are the keeper, holder of these three vows.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.340
 Three vows. And that in Vedayana, these vows are named as Samayas.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:50.340
 It is vows. It is known as Samaya, but it is conjunct, it is morality.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:58.340
 Morality, conjunct, ethics are named in the Vedayana Samayas.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.340
 So generally, what are those Samayas?

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.340
 And of course, you all know. You all know.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.340
 But I highlighted that. I highlighted that.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.340
 What in the teaching said, what is pati moksha vow,

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.340
 or sometimes translated pati moksha is a Sanskrit word,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.340
 or sorry, in the English translated, individually vows.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.340
 Vows are individuals. What actually that means?

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.340
 Because in basic Buddhism school, basic Buddha teaching,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.340
 not so much emphasize of all the living beings.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.340
 They more emphasize to individuals of their realization,

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.340
 and they are kind of free from suffering and cause of suffering.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.340
 They more emphasize individually.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.340
 So therefore, it is done individually,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.340
 liberation from the suffering and cause of suffering.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.340
 The vow that you take that.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.340
 And then, in the bodhicata vows, that changed.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.340
 That is then what we all know.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.340
 In bodhicata vow, in Mahayana teaching, Buddha highlighted,

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.340
 not just you, but all the living beings.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.340
 All the living beings are more highlighted than one's own self, in a way.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:23.340
 But every time we say, I'm going to practice in order to benefit all living beings,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.340
 in order to benefit all living beings,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.340
 in order to make the enlightenment, I'm going to practice.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:35.340
 Not that this highlight, or I'm going to practice to get myself enlightenment.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:41.340
 I'll highlight others. It's called, that's called, Mahayana's.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.340
 All bodhicata vows.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.340
 In the Vediana teaching, the old, triggered with those vows,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.340
 post and second vows, everything is enlightenment status.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:20:01.340
 Poem, song, spirit, really keeping up that attitude or that realization.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.340
 Subject, object, all enlightenment status.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.340
 Enlightened, so that means how in the teaching said,

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.340
 the all-related truth is totally, everything is enlightened.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.340
 Everything is enlightened.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.340
 And the absolute truth, everything is also empty.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:28.340
 Empty, so that means that all enlightenment is also within the emptiness.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.340
 The emptiness is within the enlightened status.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.340
 There are inseparable status.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:45.340
 Having that realization or keeping that attitude is Vediana vows.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:51.340
 So, in the Vediana practitioners, we all received empowerment.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.340
 We all received empowerment.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.340
 Then, perhaps we received roughly vows.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.340
 Or maybe we received the opasika vows.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:07.340
 Or maybe also many of you received full opasika, full ordained vows,

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.340
 whether male or female.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.340
 In that is Vinaya or the Papi muta vows.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:21.340
 Above that, Mahayana, we received bodhicata vows.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.340
 And bodhicata vows.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.340
 Vows, again, received.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.340
 Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata vows.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.340
 And then above that, in Vediana teaching, we received Vediana vows.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.340
 So therefore, we all are mostly Vediana practitioners,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:51.340
 keep, not mostly, all Vediana practitioners, keep three vows.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:59.340
 Therefore, we are bonded with one or the same Samayas.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.340
 We are all with the same Samayas, same vows.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:13.340
 We are all the same medhala or the same platforms of the vows.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.340
 Vows.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.340
 And then we very unhighlight those such as vows,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.340
 all those vows such as the Papi muta vows and the bodhicata vows,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:30.340
 all that summarize into five dhyana Buddha vows that you all know,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.340
 I think many of you know, listed five dhyana Buddha vows.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:43.340
 And then plus, 14 dharma vows.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.340
 14 root dharma vows.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:53.340
 And as big ones, we join those prayers for those practices.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.340
 Many of times, we join.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.340
 And when we attend debuya such as a vulnerable debuya, we join those.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:07.340
 We join those prayers as a purification, if we did any mistakes within that range,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:12.340
 within that time, we are cleansing, we are purifying, we are acknowledging

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.340
 in the presence of the Buddha dharma sangha, or, or,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.340
 muru deva rapini with the dharas.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.340
 Dharas.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.340
 And add don't, add big ones.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.340
 Those all.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.340
 So those are known as dhyana vows.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:40.340
 And again, maybe I listed this at five Buddha family vows.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.340
 I listed.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.340
 I mean, you all know, many of you know, we went through this, our solitary.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.340
 I remember we went, and you know, but again, those five dhyana Buddha,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.340
 of course, first you all know, what are those?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.340
 I don't know what I said.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.340
 Debi.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.340
 Tatagata families.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.340
 Tatagata families.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.340
 Rigid families.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.340
 Retna families.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.340
 Patma families.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.340
 And karna families.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:19.340
 Those are the five dhyana Buddha, or five Buddha families.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.340
 Those are five Buddha families.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.340
 Those are, yeah, they are five Buddha families.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.340
 They are not just individually family.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:35.340
 They are the ultimate state of the work of our natures, natures.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.340
 They are five Buddha families, states.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.340
 Tatagata Buddha families.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.340
 Vows of Tatagata Buddha families is work.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:56.590
 In the teachings said, the bodhicitta and morality, rafu, just are the vows of the Tatagata Buddha

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.340
 families.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.340
 Vows.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.340
 Bodhicitta means work.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.340
 Wishing vows of the wishing bodhicitta, vows of the actualizing bodhicitta,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.340
 and morality divided into three.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.340
 As we went last time, and you all know many, many of you already know this.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.340
 Those are the morality that's stopping all the negativities,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.340
 or trying to stop all the negative activities.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:33.340
 Morality that's trying to gather all the virtuous activities,

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:45.340
 and morality that's performing the beneficial activity for all the beings.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.340
 Those are the three moralities.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:56.340
 And plus, in the highlighted, rafu, vows of rafu.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:02.340
 This is what I call in the essay Tatagata Buddha family.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.340
 Vows of Tatagata Buddha family.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:11.340
 Because Tatagata Buddha family represent the body aspect of,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:19.340
 the body aspect of the Buddha, or the ground aspect of the enlightenment.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:28.340
 All the realization, achievements, is dependent upon this ground.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:34.340
 If our wishing bodhicitta is shaky, realization will be shaky.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.340
 If our actualizing bodhicitta is shaky, our realization is shaky.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:49.340
 Our morality what I listed as shaky, our realization result is shaky.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:55.340
 Our rafu, vows are shaky, realization is company.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.340
 Company, or the shaking.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:09.340
 Therefore, if these are our, if those are our family, F-I-R-M family,

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:15.340
 family, realization, achievement, result is going to be family.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:23.340
 Therefore, they are known as vows of the Batagata family.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.340
 Batagata family, or the Vedaya Bodhi family.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.340
 Then, second is Vedaya families.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:40.340
 Vedaya family vows are holding the symbol of the bell,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.340
 of the ritual object bell and a dorti.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.340
 Dorti.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:57.340
 And seeing ourself as enlightenment beings, ourself as enlightened.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.340
 So that means, you hold in the ritual object of the bell and a dorti.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.340
 That symbol, that is symbol, but what is symbol like?

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.340
 We see ourself as enlightened.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.340
 Our body is enlightened.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.340
 Our mind is enlightened.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.340
 Speech is enlightened.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:25.340
 So, mudra of the realization of the verse is keeping up.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.340
 That is, that is our, our mind is going to keep that.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.340
 We are going to keep with this, our realization by mind.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:41.340
 That realization, that attitude, therefore is called Vedaya families.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.340
 Strong and famous and confident on that under status.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:54.340
 All the skillful means and wisdom and the union of that fulfillment, keeping that.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:59.340
 It is vows of the Vedaya families.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340
 Families.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:06.340
 And then, next one is the Redna families.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.340
 Redna is what Sanskrit word Redna is.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.340
 It is prosperity or richness, richness.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:27.340
 So here, in the teaching said, because of that vows, you give always poor kind of generosity

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.340
 practices.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:33.340
 Generosity or giving and sharing the bundances.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:44.340
 And those are, first three are known as giving the abundance of materials,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.340
 giving the abundance of the word to wisdom, second is.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:55.340
 And third is giving the abundance of the protection, the security,

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:01.340
 protection is security to the other beings, whatever we have capabilities.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:08.340
 The fourth one, those all gift are completely bounded within the loving kindness.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:15.340
 So always give the abundance of love, the effortions to the others.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:21.340
 Those are known as vows of the Redna families.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:30.340
 And then, next one of vows is. Vow it is Bhendma families.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:37.340
 Bhendma family is known as Lorosa families, but also is known as speech family.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:44.340
 Speech, S-P-E-E-C-H-I-B-L-E, speech family.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.340
 Speech family means giving the word to wisdom,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.340
 sharing the word to the wisdom and holding,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:31:02.340
 keeping the word to the wisdom by starting, contemplating and meditating in the practices.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.340
 That is vows. What are those in the teachings?

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:19.090
 All the vowels, all the teachings, all the Avriyanas, inner yanas and the secret yanas, three yanas

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:19.340
.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:25.340
 What are all the Avriyanas? Those are vows of the Shravaka yana,

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.340
 but the Buddha yana and the bodhisattva yanas.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.340
 So that means keeping the teachings of the three Avriyanas.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:39.340
 The teaching of the Shravaka yana, teaching of the Pathi Buddha yana,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.340
 keeping the teaching of the bodhisattva yanas.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.340
 Keeping the teaching means what I said.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.340
 Starting, contemplating, meditating, practicing. That is keeping.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:58.340
 And then sharing to the others every year, couple of letters and ready to share to the others.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:04.340
 Sharing. And then keeping vows of the inner, inner three yanas, three inner yanas.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:12.340
 Those are the three outer tantras, such as Kriya Tantra, Upatantra, Yoda Tantra teaching.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.340
 Keeping. What means keeper again?

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.340
 Keeping means not just keeping the books. That is also Churya, of course, keeping the books.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:30.750
 Keeping the meaning of those teachings into the mind by studying, contemplating, practicing, med

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.340
itating.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:38.200
 And then expanding to the others every year, couple of letters, every year already, all those ready

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.340
, if needed.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:50.340
 Those are known as keeping the teaching of the inner, outer yana, inner yana.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:33:00.480
 And the Siva yanas. And keeping the, again, Siva yana is then Mahayoga, Anu yoga, Ati yoga, same

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.340
 way.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:07.340
 Starting, contemplating, meditating and practices.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:14.340
 Those are known as keeper. And also again, it's only all the teaching to the others,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.340
 all sharing that to the others every year, couple of letters.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:25.340
 Those are known as keeper of the yanas, yanas.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:32.340
 So that is, and that is the vowels of the bhima-pemilis.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:38.340
 In the Bhima-pemilis, the teachings are generally, the teachings are the speech of the Buddhas.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.340
 Bhima-pemilis is speech, so therefore keeping that speech.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:51.950
 If you keep that to yourself, practicing, then we are the keeper of the vowels of the bhima-pemilis

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.340
.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.340
 The next one is then Kalma-pemilis.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:00.340
 Kalma is Sanskrit word which means action or activity.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:06.340
 One is activity, related with all the Vedayana teachings that you are keeping.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:13.340
 So that means, that means you keep all the vowels, the post-post-post-post vowels,

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:19.340
 the Buddha-pemilis, the Vedaya-pemilis, the Vedana-pemilis, the Bhima-pemilis, those vowels,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:27.340
 keep those vowels above that, keeping the ritual practices, the tiny practices, the meditations,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:36.340
 that are as you said going to do, you promised, you promised to be in front of the teacher,

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.340
 or in front of the sangha, or in front of the, visualize the Buddha's bodhisattva,

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:48.340
 you mentally made those, every mentally made, not just you, we mentally made those commitments.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:54.340
 Keeping up those vowels, vowels and practices.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:35:02.620
 And together we perform with any action, activity, such as related with or within the frame of core

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.340
 activities,

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:12.340
 such as pacifying, increasing, overpowering and subjugating or removing those.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:19.340
 Any activities we can do, according our capabilities, but keep the practice and meditation,

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:25.340
 and all the, keeping the vowels exactly as, as keeping the promise, as we promised.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.340
 Those are vowels of God of Heaven.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:36.090
 So that is it, so then those, when we take the vowels, in our mind, usually we take all these vow

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.340
els,

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:42.340
 we join, or I keep them with, but the Mukti vowels, I keep my bodhisattva vowels,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:49.340
 I keep the bodhisattva vowels, we did that vowels, that is the Zeno name, we keep this vowels.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:55.340
 So now we're here, in his old dungeon we say, all those who share the same samaya,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:01.340
 we are in boundary with the same samaya, we should have affection to death,

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.340
 affection and love to all the various brothers and sisters.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:13.340
 Generally in the Buddha teaching, again in Vaidyana teaching, or Nuhangara, in Nurbata teaching,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:21.340
 generally there is four groups of the brothers and sisters, four groups of brothers and sisters.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:29.340
 Look, distant brother and, first group is distant brother and sisters.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:34.340
 Second group is inner brother and sisters.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:43.340
 And then third is, is closest, close means close, close to one's own, closest brother and sisters.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:51.340
 And the intimacy brothers and sisters, those are four groups of the brothers and sisters.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.340
 And generally to all of them we should have love and affection.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:06.250
 The first is distant brother is what? All the living beings are known as distant brothers and

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.340
 sisters.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.340
 All the living beings.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:16.340
 Second is, inner brother, all who follow the Buddha teaching, Buddhist practitioners,

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.340
 who follow in that teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Kshaktamani.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.340
 They are inner brothers and sisters.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:35.090
 Then, such as the close brothers and sisters, who are practitioners of all such as Vaidyana

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.340
 practitioners.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:41.340
 All are close brothers and sisters.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:52.330
 And then intimacy brother and sister is one who share the same Samaya, same teacher, same teachings

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:52.340
.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:38:00.340
 And practice the same thing. Those are known as intimacy, Vaidyana, brothers and sisters.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.340
 They are not just regular brothers and sisters, Vaidyana brothers and sisters.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340
 What that means?

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:12.340
 It means this bond of this connection is not just a short time.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:20.340
 According to Vaidyana teaching, from now on, until we reach enlightenment, we will be together.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:28.520
 Together, we will continue to go together and carry the similar light, carry the similar goal,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.340
 similar destination.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:37.340
 Therefore, we need affections and love and affections.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.340
 And somehow, we disregard that.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:47.880
 And then, when we carry it, for example, quote in dong pho, second dong pho, I think, or third dong

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.340
 pho, is, or third dong pho, I think, third dong pho is,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:58.340
 and criticize one's own various brothers and sisters.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.340
 Third dong pho is making big mistakes.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:09.340
 By knowing those things, what is, then we have to put it away, should put it away.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.340
 And clearly, that is really the goal.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.340
 So therefore, this is affections and love.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:30.220
 And to all these various brothers and sisters, is second trigger of, second trigger or second

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.340
 richness, wealth of the practitioners.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.340
 So that means the pure perceptions.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:42.540
 Those are the teachings, pure perception, love, and respect, and the affections of all various

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.340
 brothers and sisters.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:52.130
 Even though we see some differences, different kind of things in each other, but forgive each other

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.340
, excuse each other.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:40:02.340
 And again, that is the Buddha teaching, such as patient practices, patient practices, and forgive,

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.340
 excuse each other,

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:10.610
 forgive each other, cleanse and purification, not stay in this kind of shadow of that stance and

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.340
 clear way and move forward.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.340
 That is known as being practitioners.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:23.340
 We are making more refining of our wealth of our traders.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:30.150
 So that is really my talk for today, and I strongly thank you very much again for your

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.340
 participation.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.340
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.340
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.340
 Thank you. Thank you.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.340
 Thank you.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.340
 And now we do, again, this practice.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.340
 So I complete the talk, the teaching completely now.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.340
 And so we do short dedication prayers.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:58.340
 And then after that, then we do, what's called this, then we do the healing practices.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:07.340
 And then quite a few individuals ask to pray, do pray.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:13.340
 And then we do the pray to all those individuals who ask to do pray.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:19.100
 And then as well as we dedicate the merit for all living beings, including those who ask to do pray

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.340
.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.340
 So those are our kind of program on the schedule, so what we will do.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:30.340
 But now I completed that today's my brief talk, and we did short dedication prayers.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.340
 And we did, if you have this opening prayer, do it.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:41.340
 And we do these prayers in first words, first words.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:48.820
 By this matter, may all obtain the omissions made to be in an unknown courtroom, from the storm

00:41:48.820 --> 00:42:01.340
 phase of birth, old days, sickness, and death, from the ocean of samsara, and free all beings.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.340
 Thank you very much, again, for participation.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:13.340
 And then tomorrow, again, we continue to go on this topic at 10 o'clock in the morning.
