00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 "I was wondering, when Rudjo Rinpoche was offering teachings on his terma, was he reading ever from

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.280
 yellow scroll? Or was he..."

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 No, most of the time, his terma teachings were the "Mind Terma". What's the "Mind Terma"?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.170
 The teachings said that when he was around the age of 10, he saw Murpema Sambhava, and he saw him

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.600
 in a direct perception stage around the age of 10.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 And they turned him as Tehtung, and they gave the name as known as Dondar Lampa. I think many

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.520
 babies saw that in our Calling Lamma Pa, that Calling Lamma Pa is what?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:04.830
 "Nirma Kaia Lamma", I recall you, I call you "Nirma Kaia Lamma". So "Nirma Lamma" was the name

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.640
 given by Murpema Sambhava Hinshoja to him as Tehtungs.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 And at that time, also around that same time, that he is, when he was young, many girls came on the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.690
 direct perception, as like, what's it called? "Plimet", just with playing, like child playing,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.120
 around Tehtung.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.600
 And they really gave him yellow scroll papers and many objects, and they also have instructions to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.680
 the world.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:46.170
 But when he reached around 10s and in the 20s, then in his teaching, he said he got so many

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.670
 different kind of disturbance, one after another, and the condition looks like really not circumst

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.760
antial, the conditions are not correct.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:07.150
 And he said, "I offered all those yellow scroll papers." Welcome to the Mother Gurgaon. Gurgaon is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.640
 the fire deity, the fire prima Buddha, the prima Buddha of the West, I think.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.080
 "Sasanya Chumma Mee Gurgaon", yeah. Gurgaon is the mother of fire, that means honor, but however,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.360
 in the common level, he burned everything, as he offered.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.420
 So he said, he said, "I'm not going to make effort to reveal the Tehtung from the Earth, but I'm

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.010
 going to help and to re-staintenate the ancient those great Thetungs teaching, teaching and re-st

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.720
aintenating, and that's what I'm going to do."

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.060
 So he made that statement and he burned all the yellow scroll paper, what he obtained, the alien

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.800
 bath.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.460
 So therefore, he really didn't reveal too many in art, art thetmas. So all his, most of his Themah

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.000
 teachings are what's the mind Themah teaching.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.140
 So for example, for example, this Vaidyakalaya teaching, but Rupung, Rupung, that few years ago, we

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.340
 had the opportunity to give the teaching and go all that short sadhana, we went through that, that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.410
's all teaching is like mind Themah teaching, and with that happened, also, mixtures, I think, which

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.480
 already translated in the mind, that book, in the image, what that happened.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.880
 He's, I think, around eight, in the early thirties, and his retreat in the tiger nest, tiger nest,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:46.340
 nest, and during that night time, he had the dream, one beautiful young again, lady came, came,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.380
 came, and she said, she pulled him his hand, arms, arms, and that moment she pulled out, out, one

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.400
 purva, purva, purva, and this purva is giving to me,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:27.680
 by girl body, just before his departure from Tibet, Tibet at the Bhuntan mountain pass, Bhuntan

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.710
 mountain pass, now I'm going to give you, and when she said that, and handed that, he was so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.770
 excited and happy, happy, and he kind of, in a way grabbed that quickly, and I'm going to take the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.360
 empowerment, of course, I'm going to take the empowerment, so he put in three places, his forehead,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:38.450
 and chakra, and half chakra, and that moment, himself, become instantly that Vaidyakalaya, the last

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:51.540
 day we practiced, the Black home practice, like that, the whole universe is trembling, waking up,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.300
 trembling, and shaking, with roaring homes, and a mantra, and this young lady said, that's the way

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.360
 you should receive empowerment, that's the way you should receive empowerment.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.750
 He said that, and so that's the time he received that, this re-activated his, this, that, what's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:18.850
 called, Munahankar Kipa, as we talked about, that the three lineages, that Kabab Bhunti designated,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.360
 and prophetic lineages, and empowerment, aspirational lineage, activated, and then Dakini handed,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 handed, that seal things, handed, activated,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.360
 so that all these three, this Vaidyakalaya teaching came, but however, even though it's a dream,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.960
 and I had also opportunity to see, see, that purpa, is really, he had that purpa, it's not just a

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.800
 dream, that purpa, that many disciples said, and he, not necessarily him said, when I had the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.360
 opportunity, he showed all the collection of his therma, therma discovery things,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 but which is not mentioned is therma, all that, this is what I have found, and all these things,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.950
 they didn't say exactly when, when that, but later, though some other older students say, that's

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.390
 what he forgot, therma, that purpa, that ritual object, permission, soya, in the chagal nest, and

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.360
 when he received the, or when he re-activated it, purpa, purpa, pudrupam teachings said that.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.640
 So that's what, mostly he's on Dhuniramalaya teaching, therma teachings are like, mind therma

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.520
 teaching, and then, then of course, as he commented, that he re-activated the many therma teachings

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.400
 of the ichin therma teachings, such as Bhima Lampa, Durya Lampa, and Rana Lampa, I mean, all those

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.080
 therma teachings, he really, he re-activated that, and then re-extend, and then corrected, and then

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.360
 he kind of supported, he spread those teachings to, to so many,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.580
 told and told the students, and so that's what is the duty, and that was also predicted by Murubhe

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.860
ma Sambha, in predation, Murubhema Sambha said, his only Dhuniramalaya, all that, his, this and that

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.080
 things, but he said, he will do two things, he will re-world the new therma, or he will re-stend

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.360
 any spirit, ancient therma teachings, say that, so he did that.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.360
 Can I ask a follow-up question? -What? -Can I ask a follow-up question? -Yeah, okay.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:33.630
 When, when, when, when you were telling about when Durya Rinpoche took, took the purva and received

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.070
 the three empowerments, could you elaborate more on, you know, when, when Yeshay Sojo said, that's

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.690
 how you receive empowerment, could you talk more about how we can follow in those footsteps, and we

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.360
 can receive empowerment?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.180
 That, that is, as, as we, we, we learn, we teach empowerment, blessings of the body, speech, mind,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:52.360
 we receive that, those are the, the body blessing and the blessings of the Vedic kalaya.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:59.360
 You, when you receive the Vedic, bless of the Vedic kalaya, or when you receive the body blessings,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.510
 that means your body is become the Vedic kalaya, the same, similar status, but not just only body,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.360
 but all forms.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:17.360
 Forms of the universe, or the mass and metal. Metal are transformed as form of the wisdom.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.360
 That is the one really receiving body empowerment, with your body, but all the forms.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.170
 And then when you receive the speech, your speech is transformed as the blessings, your speech is

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:36.360
 blessed or become, become as like speech of the Vedic kalaya.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.970
 And, but same time, the whole, whole systems, and wind, wind, all transformed at the wisdom, wind,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.360
 wisdom, song.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.360
 That's what you receive the, the empowerment of the speech.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.480
 And the mind, and when you receive that empowerment, and your mind, and mind of the Vedic kalaya,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.360
 more and more, become no different, same status.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.940
 But the same time, the whole universe, the speech and the scholars, it is completely become as vast

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.360
ness, spaciousness, as Dharma, that of true nature state, as all Dharma kalaya states.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.400
 And the receiving that understanding and being in that state is known as the receiving empowerment

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.360
 of the body speech mind.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360
 Thank you.
