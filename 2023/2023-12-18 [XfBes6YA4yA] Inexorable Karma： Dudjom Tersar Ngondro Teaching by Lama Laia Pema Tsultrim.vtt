00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860
 I think what we'll do today, since we're getting started a little late, we'll have a little

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.400
 longer practice session and in relation to that a little shorter reflection period.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 So, being kind of thinking about these four thoughts that turn the mind toward the Dharma

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.120
 and of course again and again and again, as we begin every practice, calling them to our

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 mind and our heart and then with joy, devotion, contentment with all of our freedoms and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 circumstances

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.040
 that are so favorable, with really vast Bodhichitta and purity perception and that motivation

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.280
 we begin our practice and so we've gone over of course many times in the past reflecting

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 on this precious human birth with all the freedoms and favorable conditions.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.680
 We also, I think, one of the more previous times reflected a little bit on impermanence.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:34.040
 So then I was thinking to just reflect again about karma, right? The results of virtuous

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:46.280
 and unvirtuous actions which are causes are inexorable. This very profound teaching from

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.960
 the beginning that this great kindness teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni gave us, so encompassing

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.560
 and so fundamental, right? Even we say every day everything that proceeds from, for everything

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:12.400
 that proceeds from a cause, the tatagata has explained the cause and likewise the cessation.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.160
 This is the doctrine of the great sage, of the great ascetic, of this great kindness

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:31.240
 teacher, the Buddha, who pointed out the truth of interdependence. So these four noble truths

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.600
 from the very beginning are really teachings on karma.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 And what is karma, right? Is action. I think sometimes, maybe for we fortunate ones who've

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.720
 been exposed to the teachings, when we hear the word karma we know it's not only karma

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.800
 isn't just what happens to us, but we also have a play in how we react to some degree

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:17.200
 and even more so based on how we react we have some play in propelling karma. So this

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.920
 law of cause and effect, the natural law of cause and effect that the Buddha pointed out

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.760
 in these very first turning teachings that only deepen through the second turning, the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.400
 third turning. And as the obscurations are released, as bodhicitta is increased, as wisdom

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.940
 increases interdependence and relative truth becomes pure and vibrant, nothing but enlightened.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.520
 But in the meantime for we little ones, the Buddha gave these kind teachings on pointing

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:09.140
 out these real fundamental teachings like we have this four noble truths, the suffering,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.560
 the second noble truth, there's cause for suffering, the third noble truth. There's

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.200
 such a thing as the cessation or the end of suffering, freedom from suffering and for

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:30.720
 there's the path to realizing that freedom. So these are all nothing but teachings on

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:42.120
 cause and result, causes and conditions bring result, right? So the first two are focusing

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:52.720
 more on samsara on suffering. The second two truths are based on freedom from suffering

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.560
 and the conditions and causes we can engage that bring up, bring us that, that help us

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.720
 to investigate our true nature and create conditions that are more attuned and more

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:20.080
 helpful for us to absolutely have more and more direct perception of that true nature.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:36.760
 So karma means action. All of our actions have their results. You know, the cause of

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.160
 suffering, the cause of each one of us of our samsaras for all the infinite sentient

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.360
 beings is of course, as we know, the fundamental ignorance of knowing the true nature, the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:00.400
 true openness, the inconceivable great emptiness nature of everything that arises. And that

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:08.240
 very, very deep, deep down, you know, our samsara arises from not recognizing from that fundamental

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:23.080
 ignorance and based on that from deep, deep, subtle, profound hope and fear reject, you

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:33.440
 know, aversion and attachment. We wave this great spell of samsara of this interdependent

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:45.840
 web of confusion that we have. And the Buddha, of course, he taught that even emptiness, at

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.960
 least intellectually can be comprehended pretty easily. But the Buddha taught karma, the law

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.640
 of cause and effect, to truly understand it, one has to be omniscient, one has to be fully

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:11.360
 enlightened. But there's basic things we can all ways we can, we can understand karma,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.320
 which is what again, if we always remember is one, it's inevitable. Every single experience

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:28.280
 that we're having, every perception we're having, the experience of our current body

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:36.120
 and the emotions we have, the way we read things, the choices we make, to do or not

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:47.200
 do things, all of that is nothing but karma. So it's a really interesting play of like

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:55.920
 what appears to be our choices. But it's all, again, fabricated, because like the Buddha

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.160
 pointed out, every, we have this sense of I, but if we look at everything that, well,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:11.020
 what makes up this I, such as the teachings on the aggregates, these like groupings of

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:18.480
 different classes of our gross and subtle experience that makes up ourself, when we

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:27.680
 go to look, we can't find that, right? So this basic ignorance and the actions we do

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.160
 causes our samsara. So I'm going to kind of go over things very skim over things, because

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.120
 I think it's really important we practice. And then next week, we'll go a little bit

00:08:40.120 --> 00:09:00.640
 more in depth into some of these details. So while we have all these sense of self and

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:10.100
 all of our experiences and everything we've done, its effects are with us now. So along

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.280
 with, you know, all the teachings the Buddha gave on such as the five aggregates, he also

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:24.800
 gave teachings on, you know, the 18 dhatus or, you know, which is essentially other ways

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:33.680
 we frame our sense of self and our experience, right is there's our con our consciousness

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:41.680
 and all of our sense consciousnesses inside inside. And then there's the objects of those

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:52.160
 consciousnesses, all the sights, all the sounds, all the smells, all the tastes, all the sensations

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.160
,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:03.520
 all the mental perceptions we have are the objects of our mental consciousness, of our

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:10.280
 eye consciousness, of our ear consciousness, of our nose consciousness, of our tongue consciousness

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.440
,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:19.000
 of our body consciousness. And the habitual patterns, again, that help kind of connect

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:31.160
 those two realms are then these organs, right? There's our eyes, the eye organ, the ear organ,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:40.960
 the nose organ, the tongue organ, the body organ, the mental organ, which is the brain.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.760
 That's through all right, all the senses are going there, all the consciousness are, says

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:55.000
 are perceiving through them, their objects, subject and objects. These are all habitual

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.960
 patterns. And what we're doing in our practice, right, is we're breaking down our habitual

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:11.560
 patterns, which is to say we're increasing our wisdom. The other thing, again, we say

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.320
 every day, right, from everything that proceeds from a cause, the tatagata has explained the

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:29.120
 cause. And likewise, the cessation, these four noble truths. And then so those are the truths.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:38.280
 These are kind of the views. But how do we actualize that? Along with our joy, appreciation,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:45.920
 our bodhicitta, our trust, we actualize that through this basic thing that sums up all

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:56.920
 of our practices. Avoid harmful, un-virtuous actions. Engage in positive, helpful, balancing,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:06.640
 virtuous activities. Tame our own mind. So on that rough edge of things, become more

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:16.000
 and more aware of what's helpful and what's harmful. Try not to engage with what's harmful.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.880
 Let go. Engage more with what's helpful. And then of course with that, the practice of

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:34.960
 increasing our wisdom. More and more directly perceiving, you know, what's both on the level

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.240
 of that relative level, what's helpful, but also having more and more insight into the

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:51.560
 empty nature of ourself, of the world, but direct and full of, again, the qualities not

00:12:51.560 --> 00:13:07.760
 only of that wisdom, but inseparable from that love, compassion. So all of our bodhicitta

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:36.200
 and our presence. And so along with these other teachings, fundamental teachings, such

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:46.560
 as the five aggregates, you know, the 18 sense fields, so what we call them, or the 18 dhatus,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:54.320
 there's the 12 nidanas, which again are kind of specifically how the Buddha taught a way

00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:03.680
 we can look at kind of the mechanics of how karma happens. So again, we'll go over that

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:13.080
 more next week, but I'm sure you've heard of these 12 links of interdependent origination

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:22.120
 or tendril, the way the Buddha taught, the way the whole web and weave of our whole perception

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:33.000
 of self and other and action every moment, every day, every month, every year, every life

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:46.840
 from beginningless time, this infinite disguise, that's called samsara happens. And so again,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:55.400
 that's, that's basically these 12 links we've heard. So maybe we can go through them. Whether

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.560
 or not, you know, it's good to remember these things, but don't worry about remembering

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.560
 it now. Because again, maybe next week, I'll try to send everyone something we can look

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:12.760
 at visually, because I know that helps me too. So the links essentially right, are showing

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:20.240
 this web, how everything the interdependent works and how the cycles of karma happen,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:28.360
 whether it's every moment, or lifetime to lifetime, it kind of can be applied to all

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:35.040
 those stages of how karma happens. Again, for sentient beings, this is what we're talking

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:43.880
 about samsara being caught in this web in the wheel of life, like we see in the monasteries.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:54.160
 That shows from the basic ignorance, hatred and attachment. The all the six realms arise

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:02.600
 through this interdependent co origination. And what's there, this huge monster, which

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:11.240
 is essentially the great emptiness. So right, it said, even at the time of death, most every

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.800
 being is introduced to their true, open, brilliant nature, and is terrified and goes looking

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.880
 for shelter. That's kind of what that I think in one way, what that big old monster is pointing

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:34.900
 out. So this wheel of interdependence begins ignorance, the fundamental not knowing of

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:46.400
 how things are. This is the real ground that allows all of our samsara to function. Based

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:54.800
 in the seed in that ground is then the second link, which is called the karmic formations

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:03.040
 or karmic seeds. That means all of our past actions, all the past actions from our previous

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.960
 moments, all of our habitual patterns that are stored in our alaya and are in our way

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.480
 in the ground of our ignorance, these seeds are there in the ground of our ignorance,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:23.120
 these habitual patterns. And then, you know, so those karmic seeds in the ground of our

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:31.760
 ignorance, they're going to just naturally give rise to consciousness and our habitual

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:39.800
 patterns. So then consciousness is the third link. Then it goes on through name, name and

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:48.740
 form, you know, kind of the conditions that our consciousness needs to begin to be embodied

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:55.400
 within that embodiment, then the six senses, the habitual pattern of our six senses begin

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:07.400
 to engage. And then they, again, are the habitual patterns of our six senses are not only the

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:15.240
 physical organs and the consciousnesses, but their objects as well. So once that is happening,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:24.480
 then we have the next stage, which is called contact when our consciousness meets through

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:34.160
 our senses, meets the objects of our senses, they're all that circuits flowing. And then

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:41.800
 the habitual patterns of how we feel our feelings about it happen. And then there's the next

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:55.480
 thing is, do we want more of it or less of it, you know, so that craving and then grasping.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:03.240
 And then there's the 10th link, which is called becoming and then 11th birth. And then the

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:13.640
 12th old age and death. And then again, or decay and death. And then the cycles complete.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:22.960
 So that's a lot of details, ignorance, karmic seeds, bring forth consciousness. And within

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:35.920
 that is the name and form, the six senses engaging, contact, feeling, craving, grasping,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:47.160
 becoming or birth, birth, old age, and death. So that cycle is perpetually happening. And

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:55.280
 right, we can see within that are again, looking at cause and effect. So these first, and also

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:04.280
 there's our sense to write in every moment, we have the illusion of past present future.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:10.920
 So in a way, these, it was like me, Palmer, but she explains these first two links, ignorance

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:17.760
 and karmic seeds. In a way that's like what our present that's the past of our present

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:25.840
 moment. Or even our, we could say our present life, present life, present moment, the past

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:34.280
 of our present moment is what can be called here, ignorance and karmic seeds. And our

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:45.240
 present moment is then the next, what like five or so links all of our, the way our,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.960
 the way our experience of our consciousness and our sense fields, being active with subject,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:00.680
 object, how we feel, how we engage all of that, what we choose to do and what we choose

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:08.600
 not to do, how we feel about it. All that happens within the present moment. So consciousness,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:17.720
 name, form, six senses, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, those are all

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.760
 within these 12 links, what we can consider the present moment. And of course they're

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:29.680
 links, but this is all like instantaneous to our perception. And then again, on the

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:38.720
 bigger scale, it could be called this present life as well. And then the future, the future

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.920
 is going to come be the result, right, of the way we engage with the present moment.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:54.960
 What that gives birth to, how that exists, how that again, everything that is, you know,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:05.080
 comprised of parts and conditioned is bound to die, is impermanent. So then when that

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:14.320
 ceases to be, you know, decays, dies, disappears, falls apart, that's the, that's for the future.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:23.920
 So there's past present future in the sense of karma too. Within our present moment, we

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:32.400
 really don't, again, all, all of our present moment is circumstantial. There's really nothing

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:39.280
 we can do about it. It's totally based on our habitual patterns, our actions and our

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:47.280
 ignorance that's been, you know, perpetuated. And thankfully, we have such good fortune,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.240
 right? We have, we have some connection with the true nature and these great wisdom teachings,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:01.200
 which is equally part of our karma. Karma is not just bad. Knowing about it is important.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:10.000
 Like not knowing the four noble truths. That's the cause of, that's ignorance. We have been

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.200
 introduced to these by this great kindness teacher. So within this present moment, the

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:34.960
 results, right, of our, you know, the results are our consciousness and our whole experience.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.800
 So that goes up to within these 12 links, again, consciousness, name and form, our sense

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:53.960
 fields activated, you know, the habitual patterns on the level of how we feel, associate value,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:05.940
 you know, either have fear or want or need needs, hopes or fears towards our experiences,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:19.080
 how we engage with them. All of that is kind of the results is the effect of our past.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.240
 We don't have a lot to do with it. But then what makes all the difference now is with

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:32.940
 more mindfulness, with more openness, with more awareness of the inevitability of that

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:44.920
 negative actions based on negative emotions, bring unfavorable results and actions based

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:56.840
 on virtuous, meaning kindness, natural qualities, bring forth more favorable results, especially

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:09.160
 with wisdom, with bodhicitta. So then what we refrain from doing, what we engage with

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:15.480
 doing, this is what makes the difference for the future, right? These are the causes we're

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:21.180
 creating then the causes in the present moment. This is the aspect of the present moment that

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:35.380
 we're bringing forth inevitable future events, future experiences. So how we feel about something,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:46.000
 then what we actually do or don't do is what then propel pushes forth future karma to manifest

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.200
 and become a present moment, right? So of course the path of Dharma is one of ever increasing

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:05.620
 our wisdom, taming our own mind, knowing our own mind. And along with that path is this

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:16.160
 aspect of refraining from harm, engaging in benefit. So then in regards with these teachings

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:28.300
 of the 12 links, right, another where that first link, the more we examine our own egolessness,

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:36.140
 have not only intellectual understanding, but more and more direct perception of emptiness

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:47.900
 of self and then emptiness of other, direct perception into the great openness that we're

00:26:47.900 --> 00:27:01.340
 increasing our wisdom. And then again, that brings more freedom and more openness, more

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:09.420
 flexibility maybe at least in our view within our present experience. Within that present

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.260
 experience as we're more and more aware of our habitual patterns and more aware of what's

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:23.740
 helpful and what's not helpful, then we can really choose and have more control over refraining

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:32.700
 from harm and even better engaging in benefit. And so that's again in this next, that link

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:42.420
 between that present moment, how we engage between feeling and then how we feel about

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:51.020
 it and engage with it, it brings up on just without a doubt, future experiences. And of

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:58.180
 course in the teachings, when we plant a seed, the seed in the right conditions brings many,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:07.180
 many fruits. Right. And so there's that. So another way of looking at that, right, we're

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:16.460
 increasing our wisdom and this point too, within the wheel of interdependent of karma

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:24.180
 happening in the inevitability of karma is both again, with the view that harmful negative

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:32.500
 emotions and actions based on negative emotions and bring forth negative experiences, more

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:40.580
 confusion, actions based on more wisdom and natural qualities of love and compassion and

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:51.780
 wisdom. Those bring forth more and more positive experiences, helpful experiences that's called

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:58.860
 merit. So within our whole path of these two wings of our practice, right, are accumulating

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.980
 merit and wisdom. Here merit, it's not just like a badge we're putting on for being good

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:16.420
 boy or a good girl. This is like means we're truly acting in a natural way. We're truly

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:25.660
 activating our bodhicitta with less grasping, upturning our own samsara by activating the

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:36.940
 six paramitas based on truly boundless sincere for boundless aspirations that brings upon,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.260
 you know, more positive quality. So we're accumulating that's accumulating merit, which

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:48.180
 again within the law of calls and effect. That's what we're doing here with this link

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:56.100
 with our present moment, engaging in benefit. And again, then from the view of the enlightened

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:03.420
 ones of our great kindness teachers and guides, who've given us all these tools, given us

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:11.580
 this nundra practice itself, as well as whole nine yanas to explore and engage and attain

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:18.820
 fulfillment, mature our own minds and then be true of true benefit and refuge and sources

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:31.380
 of peace for the infinite beings of samsara. We have this great tendril. So again, from

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:39.420
 the enlightened perspective, everything is empty, everything is open. And yet even the

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.140
 enlightened ones are working with karma. In the sense of our favorite, they're not slaves

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:54.060
 to karma. They're not caught up in the nets of illusion and obscurations and emotional

00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:01.220
 and knowledge obscurations. They're totally liberated from those. And yet interdependence

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:08.020
 always works. There's relative truth. There's absolute truth. And we're, we can't, while

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:16.660
 there are in union, when we're truly perceive the truth of that, they are in union, but

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:25.860
 we shouldn't confuse them while we're still young ones, you know? So like Guru Pashay said,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:37.020
 my view is as vast as space. And yet my attention to the law of cause and effect is as fine as

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.580
 flower. That's how these great ones can give us these teachings, these skillful means practices

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:53.620
 of the Vajrayana, which through interdependence is working with our own samsara to undo the

00:31:53.620 --> 00:32:02.340
 nets of our samsara and reveal the pure relative truth display of our Buddha nature, right?

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:13.660
 Keeping out that beautiful, bounteous bodhicitta for our own self. So keeping our emptiness

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:27.560
 awareness along with our bodhicitta, true bodhicitta motivation is so critical. And

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:35.020
 now I said I wasn't going to talk for long, but I did. So maybe we'll leave it there.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.220
 Forgive me if I've forgotten some big thing or if you're all there scratching your heads.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.860
 But you know, we'll kind of revisit some of these things next week. And if anyone has

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:52.060
 any questions, you know, please write in and maybe specifically about some of these things.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.260
 I wish we were all here in the same room to kind of talk in real time, but we're not.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:06.420
 But we have this wonderful opportunity to be together this way. So thank you. And now

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:18.100
 we'll work on again using this favorable moment to accumulate our merit, our wisdom, and know

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:25.440
 it's inevitable, you know, as much as we can be truly frightened by seeing like the inevitability

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:34.500
 of our past actions. But just that is purifying, right? On every level of the nundra practice,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:43.880
 we can see how we're working to, again, to free up the nets of our samsara to bring more

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:51.500
 peace for all beings, ourselves and others. So recognizing a mistake for a mistake is

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:57.700
 purification. And we have these beautiful, skillful means. And equally, so when we say

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:04.940
 this in the four thoughts, the results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions are inexorable.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:11.900
 We can both connect with, oh, you know, just for ourselves and for others, seeing how when

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:23.980
 we're acting with ignorance and the five poisons engaged in grasping, it's, if anything, boring,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.420
 but even more so kind of terrifying and scary, right? But again, that's why we need to really

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:38.220
 keep our practice and not get really look to looking for our own mind, what we're experiencing

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:43.020
 and mingling our mind with the great enlightened ones with Guru Rinpoche, inseparable from

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:53.820
 our root teacher. And that the effects of that are inevitable. When we truly connect

00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:02.740
 with the Dharma, hear the Dharma, contemplate the Dharma, bring it into our heart. Don't

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:10.900
 shirk away from the shadowy places or the harmful places, but let them be part of our

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:19.060
 bodhicitta practice. Embrace everything according to our abilities. You know, inevitably, we're

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:29.700
 turning everything to the path. Bless my mind to turn toward the Dharma. Bless my Dharma

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:43.220
 path to bless my, bless my mind to turn towards the Dharma. Bless, I'm totally spacing out.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:50.860
 Bless my mind to turn towards the Dharma. Bless my Dharma practice to follow the path. Bless

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:58.180
 my path to be free of delusion. Bless me that all delusion be transformed into wisdom. And

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:07.300
 this is inevitable when we're really embracing everything with our practice. So yeah, contemplating

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:15.380
 these four thoughts, both as we set out, but also while we're from moment to moment, as

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.900
 we're doing our practice and in our day, helps us recheck, check in with our motivation,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:30.980
 right? Because it's motivation that makes Karma more or less strong. That's definitely

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.620
 really vital in the Buddhist teachings. How we feel about what we're going to do, how

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:46.100
 we feel while we're doing it, how we feel if we completed it, makes the Karma stronger,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:52.900
 if we have really strong feelings and good feelings about it. So anyway, I'll stop here.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:37:22.660
 And we'll just take a few moments to just rest in silence, recenter.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:52.420
 Okay. All right. So, we're going to start with our next question. So, we're going to start.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:38:03.060
 We cite the seven line prayer, lineage prayers. And we'll go to our nundra practice.
