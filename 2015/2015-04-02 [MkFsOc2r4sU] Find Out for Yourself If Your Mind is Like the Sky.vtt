00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 "Your nature or your mind, your mind is empty, and my mind is empty, emptiness mind. How mind is

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:22.000
 empty is like sky, mind is empty, your mind is empty as a sky.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And if that is true or not, you read to your mind. You find out if it is true or not.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 How do you do this? How do this? And you look inwardly, inwardly, inwardly to your mind.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Oh, I use the word, look to the lookers. Watch to the watchers. And look to that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 And when you look to that mind, when you look into the looker, that moment, or look to that, look

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 at that moment, relax.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 If you look to the looker, look to the looker, directly look to the looker, and then relax.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 That moment, you will see what is really different between the sky and mind.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 What is the difference? You will find out. You will see.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And that emptiness is what in the Dzogki teaching said, or higher teaching said.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 This is the Dharmakaya. That is Dharmakaya.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 What we heard Dharmakaya call it is, of course, I am making before many times, you know that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Dharmakaya is free from the complex cities, free from the extremes. It is old in nature.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It is built from the beginning. It has no directions, no times. It is pervasives.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 That is our natural, emptiness nature of the mind.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.140
 Here, to discover that nature, great master says, look to the looker, and instantly relax on that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 state.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Stand up. That means you are not going to look more than that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Looking to the looker, that is enough. That is enough to discover true quality of the nature.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 If you are trying to look more than that, it is publications. It is dualities.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Then we are pulling ourselves. So that is what the symbol is, what the great master says.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 There is nothing to do. It is so simple, so easy, so natural, and relax.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 So that now we discover that the mind is the influence. Our mind is the emptiness.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 This natural mind is not just the negation state of the empty.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 It is the negation of the blank empty. Or it is the partiality empty.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:56.800
 It is, is, then here, next to life, the great master says, it is self-luminesity, self-awareness,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.000
 self-awareness, self-luminesity.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Immediately, when you discover the mind is empty, that moment, that same time, mind is luminosity,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 mind is clarity.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.140
 Clarity is status. And it is, it is, again, here the great master says, it is like essence of like

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.000
 sound.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 It is like essence of sound, self-bone, self-bone, self-luminesity, essence of sound.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And again, to discover this natural, natural, this is true or not true.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Again, find out with your own mind, with your own mind, how to this.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:02.080
 To that, again look to the look of itself and relax in that instance and behold that vast clarity

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.000
 qualities of the nature of the mind.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 That is, that is clarity. Something that we cannot explain yet it is verbal experience.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 That verbal experience is the clarity. That is what we experience.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.880
 This is what, again, in the teaching said, as the great master pointed out, that is sambhokaya

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.000
 nature.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.260
 This is sambhokaya. This is sambhokaya and dharma kaya, as again in the teaching mentioned, they

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.000
 are not separated.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 All is or both are within the both. There is no difference at all.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.780
 That verbal really, that openness and that infinite vastness, that emptiness, there is no

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.000
 difference between at all.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And that is, again, we are not talking someone else's mind or the Buddha's mind.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 We are talking ourselves. That is what this great master on the Dzokhi point out to us.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Introducing our innate nature of the mind, our goal is what it is.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.860
 And always correct that, restenstant it, reactivate that, realize it with our mind, with your mind,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.000
 with my mind.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 That is this. So that is what it says.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Now, this combination of emptiness and clarity is not just that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 The nature is movement-less.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 As we said before, we went to, and the debate is called joy. Joy. Joy means movement.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 So that means thoughts are coming. Thoughts are coming. So, thoughts are movement, movement of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 thoughts.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Thoughts are movement, movement of thoughts.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And we think, again, where is it coming?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.770
 When this thought, movement of thoughts came, coming, we cannot explain any place of source where

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.000
 it is coming.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 You cannot identify that source itself.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Again, look to your mind. It is true or not.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 When our thoughts, all those coming, where it is coming, where it is coming?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Also, they are coming unpredictably.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 There are no regulations of the thoughts.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Coming just can't be like as showing up as it is.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Very pretty without any thought.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 How is that happening?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 How is that happening? Use examples here by great masters.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And this is also, I am going to be able to use an example like this. This is tea. I am going to be

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 able to use an example like this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Sit here. Same as like blowing air in the sky, on the space.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Space. Thoughts are coming as blowing the wind in the space.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Space.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And again, it is true or not, read with your mind.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 It is true. That example or that whole thing is true or not.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Read with your mind.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 So that also, indicating, is not just a story.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 It is not just a something kind of other side.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 It is exactly like that. This is our nature of the mind.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Mind ourself, our weight, our goodness.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And so, to see this again, to find out, out of this, this again, so read your mind with this.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 And where that thought went? Where does thought went?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Also, when we can't say it went any further.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Came as unpredictably, came as without any substantial existence,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 and went way as wind went in the space.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Space. In order to discover this nature again, to make sure, again,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 look to that thought, the moment of thoughts, by yourself.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 So, look to the, that thought, the way that thought.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 The moment you look to that, your arising thought, the moment of thoughts,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 that moment, it is evaporated.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Or it is liberated. Liberated.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 There is nothing any substantially that we can pick up.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 So, happened as magic. Magic games. Came, be, and went left.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 There is no even trace of that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And now, next one, all this, so that is according, I mean, not according,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 this is narmakai and this. Moment of thoughts are narmakai.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 That is what it is.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And now, next one is, all what we have, what we call, subject and objects.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 When we look to the world, there is subject and object.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Our thought and the concept are as a subject, that was already explained.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Already explained is all empty, all as like illusions or the magics.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Now, our thought, objects. Object when we look to the outside.
