00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 Thank you. Now, again we continue with the teaching of the Aamud Inadhamdara.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 Aamud Inadhamdara is the highest decision, or is the pick of the Mahayana teachings.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.580
 And that is the Mahārati teaching.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.780
 And within the Aadeya teaching, there is also, divided as three sections.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.200
 The mind sections, spirit sections, feet and sacrum sections.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.960
 So there is three sections, those are the teachings, always mentioned.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.680
 And among the feet and sacrum sections, there is also, divided in four groups.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.240
 Outlaw, inner, and the cigarette, and mostly cigarette.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.580
 Those are the four groups.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.920
 Among that four groups, today we are, or this time,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.820
 we are following of the mostly cigarette teachings.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 And for that reason, it is also known as the heart draw of the Madan Rakinis.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 All enlightenment, really, this essence, is a nugget, enlightenment call it,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.300
 or nugget dharmakaya, we are really touching.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.600
 We are discovering that dharmakaya, dharmakaya as the mirror image,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.280
 as this great master, as this great lineage, lineage practice.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.580
 It is discovered, today we are discovered of that.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.860
 They all put as manual in the tips how to follow that,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.100
 and discover our inner nature of dharmakaya.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.960
 So this is the greatest, and most powerful, yet it is most so simple,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.280
 in the so directed practices, for those reasons.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.600
 Again, we should always be grateful, joyful, to many double levels.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 We are ourselves as human beings, and wonderful.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 Not just only that, we have the 18 endowments.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.560
 Not every human being has that, and we have the 18 endowments.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.040
 Not just only that, we are activating that 18 endowments, call it this, really,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.360
 and practicing that.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.240
 It is so wonderful, so spiritual.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.680
 Therefore, fill you in happy, our song, and fill you in happy,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.720
 and create you to the lineage.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.080
 Masterless, all the lineage, from the Buddha, Samman, the Buddha,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560
 or the Buddha, Knyakyamuni, all the way.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.720
 They preserve this teaching, teaching in a continuous.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.160
 So we have to kind of look to these teachings as much as we can,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 and discover our inner nature.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.200
 That's really so, so spiritual.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.360
 So those levels, we should always be grateful, joyful,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.320
 feel very devoted, devotions from the heart.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.240
 Not just the same, these things.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.480
 It's really from the core of the heart, in the teachings.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.720
 Follow the examples of those great master,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.520
 Jinwi Lempa and Lemchimpa, and as well as Bhartu Rumbuji.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.400
 So all of them, we call the great masters.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.960
 When we read this large story, how much they have?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.760
 They just act as ordinary, but they're devotions.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.560
 They're drawn for effort to the Dharma.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.280
 They're just mind-boggling.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440
 Really, so powerful, so simple.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.720
 And they're drawn to the earth, grown,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.320
 not just kind of claiming this and that, this, that.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.960
 Those, we say, they're all emanation, they're there.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.120
 Those are said by the students.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.600
 They're promoted there.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.440
 I'm sure they are there.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.200
 Them shall sit just as a regular person, practicing meditation.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.400
 And what we see, they actualize.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.680
 They met the difference in their lives.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 Really, truly, they met.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160
 Where they act in the beginning,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 and where they propose the goals, that is different.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.560
 That is the nugget result.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.280
 Nugget is sign, evidence.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.120
 They met some big chains in there.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 And so, therefore, for joy and happy and appreciation

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.560
 and the devotions.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.160
 Together with that, and then compassion.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.400
 Bow in kindness, compassion of all living beings.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
 That is essence of this.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 Also, joka is bodhicata.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 Bodhicata.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.960
 Joka is absolute bodhicata.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.040
 Absolute bodhicata and relative bodhicata are inseparable

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.320
 and identical, united.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.400
 Relative bodhicata is accumulation practice,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.080
 accumulation merit.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.680
 And the worst, absolute bodhicata is worst merit.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.360
 Worst merit and accumulation merit are needed in the teachings.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.120
 Without that, we won't get realization.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.880
 Devotion and two merits are really so important.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
 So important.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.440
 And to activate those accumulation merits,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.200
 gracious teachings, bodhicata can be laid out so perfectly

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.920
 and beautifully, those six parameters practice.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.920
 Those are generally, all those five parameters are,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.200
 according to teaching, are accumulation practice.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.600
 Wisdom is the zokki practice, the paramata.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.040
 Wisdom is the paramata of the zokki meditation.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.000
 So therefore, generating bodhicata is so important

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.600
 and so necessary.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.040
 And to get enlightenment.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.800
 This is also not just a kind of talking and thinking

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.200
 that trying to activate those up from the heart,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.920
 really, as much as you can.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.240
 Then, that's what really makes it very, very special.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.240
 So it's good for us now.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.760
 It's good to help those who, when we leave this world,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.600
 also really will leave very confidence and joy

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.200
 and really with kind of fulfillment, really will leave.
