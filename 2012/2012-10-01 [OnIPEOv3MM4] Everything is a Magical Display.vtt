00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.480
 "Everything first day as a Sutra. Sutra is every Buddha's teaching as Mahayana. Everything is, is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.600
 Unsolid, Asly-Magical. Unsolid-Magical. If all phenomena existing, include your soul. If you see as

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.840
 Unsolid, solid, magical, dream-like, that is good realization. Very good realization."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.710
 Then, when you, when you become that stronger, stronger, then what in the Vajrayana of, in the S

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.420
utra of Sikkim said, and as well as also in the Vajrayana too, is known as then, the emptiness

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 appearance in, in sapera.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 And that is also great visualization, great meditation, great realization. When you realize that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.940
 everything as translucent emptiness, as like form is emptiness, emptiness form everything, as in

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.530
 that status. That is great realization, and that is great. That is true nature. It's nothing, again

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.000
, strange anything, but it is exactly the nature it is.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.140
 Then, the next one in the Vajrayana teaching, as I spoke, is known as the, everything is divine,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 mandala of the great blissfulness of emptiness, same palette.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 That translucent state is magical, and emptiness, appearance is the same thing, but now bliss

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.000
fulness of great wisdom. That is what all come by. Exactly.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.790
 Immediately, we are lifted up from the ordinary mandala, you are in war, to the ordinary state of

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.000
 the our, ours, our truth, our nature as great blissfulness, emptiness.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.880
 That is known as the, the skillful means of the Vajrayana teachings, is swept path, quick path,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.420
 quick path, instantly you are entered in that. That is good realization, all that excellent

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 realization.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.050
 And then we kind of, we explore the natures of beauty, but also there is another one, right? That

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:28.090
 is called, what's called? Heg, Heg is a jitapat, you know, right? Heg is a what? Heg is a bhosa. He

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.110
g is a bhosa. Have you had the realization of the Heg is a bhosa. Heg is a bhosa, Heg is a bhosa, or

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 strength in you. That's it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.540
 Have you had the strength in realization? Without the laboratory machine, that is good realization.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.000
 Definitely.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.310
 That means yourself and the object in a strange state. A strange state. That is good, magical

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.000
 realization.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.980
 This is all relative levels. All the relative levels. Good. Without really laboratory supports.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.000
 Have you had that realization, strength I think? And I think quite good.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 You are quite close to the state of the relative tools. Quite deep state of the relative tools.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.000
 Quite good realization.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.830
 What is a praise? What all is tells? There is no substantial, solid, tangible existence. Everything

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.000
 is that for magical display. Everything starts with the status.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.180
 For those who are using, Buddha uses examples to prove that, to make that kind of that we can

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.000
 understand and move forward as like those example used as surfing boat that we can move forward.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.570
 Those are the magic dream, reflection of the moon and the water, mirage and rainbows and then

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.000
 double images and hallucination cities in the space after drops or during drops.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.340
 All those Buddha use examples to catch up this realization, this nature. Nature is that status. The

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 relative nature is displayed. This is what all is displayed.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.910
 This is not just mystery or talking something far beyond. This is really what it is. It is. In

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.000
 order to bring up this realization quickly as nature is and then we do this visualization.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.680
 Visualization meditations. And that is. And so that is now you understand. The purpose of this

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.080
 visualization is to bring up the anxiety where the nature is and break down our habit patterns or

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.350
 the transforming habit, our habit patterns and then revert the blessfulness in light of the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.000
 qualities of this every, every existing or everyday.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.820
 That is the purpose of the visualizations. So with this understanding and now I move forward, we

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.000
 move to this.
