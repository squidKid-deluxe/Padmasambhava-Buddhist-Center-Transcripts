00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 Thank you again everyone. Thank you very much, everyone participating. Thank you for coming

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 and for participating. Thank you very much, everyone. Again, participating in making time

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.940
 and effort, joyful effort, and to put triple things, to put together and make this time

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.460
 and be with us. And we will be discussing the teachings of the Glorious Teacher, Buddha

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.860
 Shakyamuni, and Gauraben Mahsambhava, according to our best capabilities with, again, full

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.340
 of joy and devotion, and bodhic thought is one of the beautiful, again, moment, the beauty

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.740
 of things to do in our lifetime. According to other teachings, we will be making it meaningful

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 of our lives, which is so important. Life is precious. Life is so important. And life

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.920
 is also precious. And it is not staying forever and ever, but well, everything in our control,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.380
 in our kind of side, then to take this advantage and take the opportunity to cultivate our inner

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 strength of joy, peace, happiness, realization, bodhic jata. And those are really according

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.860
 to the teaching of the Glorious Teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, we are touching to the core of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.700
 our nature, treasure. It will give us reward. It will support. It will become as like cushion

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.260
 for us, continued for all the time. Not just on this lifetime, but continually, according

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.220
 to the teaching, as we go on, as we go on, it really will support according to the teaching.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.780
 And that was witnessed by so many great practitioners, masters. So therefore we are on that path,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 we're in that direction, which is wonderful and thankful. Again, again, to continue to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.900
 follow the teaching of the Glorious Teacher of Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurabha Masambhava,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:06.300
 as we all know, the most important is to correct the motivation or have the right, important,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 good motivation. What does that mean? We have so many motivations, so many thoughts and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.020
 conceptions. Many times those are very much connected with mondings. That means mondings

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.340
 with samsaras, grasping, duality, and in summary of those self-import and all that. But correct

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 motivation, what we're talking here, is more joy, more appreciation, more modest thinking

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 of all the beings, really. Sensitive from heart and mind, according to our best capabilities,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.700
 those are correct motivations. Along with that, today we are reconnected with the teaching

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.180
 of the Glorious Teacher of Buddha Shakyamuni, which is not just the Buddha Gita teaching

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.620
 we are connecting. When we go through this teaching, and as you all know, it is a nugget

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 teaching of our own treasures, our own nature of the mind, our qualities, our goodness qualities.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.020
 We're exploring that. That is so important. According to the teaching, and we know too,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.020
 we know that for a long time, from the beginning of this time until now, we really can't carry

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.900
 by the force of the duality and unnecessary, unbeknownst thought, which is self-important,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.660
 based on the ego clings. But today, we are turning the back to the right directions,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.980
 looking to our treasures, re-standing and building up our strength so that can continually

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.380
 benefit us and benefit for all the beings. So that is what really so important, and that's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.260
 the motivation. That starts with the joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation, our situation,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.580
 and our qualities, being as beautiful human beings, and all the opportunity, everything

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:11.930
 with us, 18 endowments. It's called 18 endowments. We have that. We all have that. But 18 endow

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.380
ments,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.700
 if we don't activate it, maybe we have the add freedoms, but the 10 endowments, sometimes

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.820
 it's going to miss. It becomes shrinking. Therefore, to activate those qualities, then

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:35.260
 perfectly, 18 endowments, joy and appreciation, courage and commitment, inspirations. Along

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.140
 with that, then also devotions. Teaching was so precious and important because it's our

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.620
 nature. Buddha is pointing out one after another how to activate our beautiful qualities, nature.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.080
 So it is really meeting and discovering this beautiful teaching. It's not just to go

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.300
 accidental. According to the teaching, it is very special. We are all dynamically connected

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.180
 to this teaching. Feel happy and joy. We're just returning back or going back to our own

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.660
 treasures. How wonderful, how beautiful. Thanks to the Buddhas, Gaurab and Masambhav,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.540
 all the lineage masters and the Dunyun long pass, true, lineage master, continue to carry

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.180
 that. Lineage master is not just a lineage master, some kind of big thing that, but they

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.820
 are great practitioners. They are so devoted. They are so humble. They are so simple and

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.100
 courage and commitment. They really practice it, what they receive the teaching and that's

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.580
 why they actually like that and then therefore they become great lineage masters. We are

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.460
 also lined up that, that part is not something. So therefore, feel happy and a joy and we

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.100
 feel strong devotions. And together with that, according to Mahayana, essence teaching of

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.740
 the Mahayana teaching is a body that you all know. Again, I'm repeating that it's not something

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.020
 that you don't know and also I maybe don't know, but we have to activate it. We have

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.180
 to glorify this body together. Really thinking of a sentient or living beings, that today

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.900
 I'm going to practice and one way I'm going to practice, I'm going to practice one month

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.180
 or whole time, made that benefit to all sentient beings. What means benefit? Removing the suffering

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.300
,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.420
 the difficulty, the turbulence, cause of suffering, the turbulence, the difficulties and the reward

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.380
 in the nature as Buddhahood, discover that. Really made this our activity, made our practice

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.100
 become sensitive for that purpose, for that reason. That is bodhicata with boundless, poor

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.700
 boundless those kind of activated, all those qualities. And then in the teaching, this

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.620
 is the Vadhyana teaching. And the Vadhyana teaching is then they're regularly going to

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.820
 the result or the fruit of the enlightenment, the realization of the enlightenment or they're

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:16.460
 regularly to the purity status. Purity status, that means pure from the dualities. So totally

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:23.380
 pure from duality and bring up that realization. Those are the teaching said, all three, whether

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:31.600
 status, whether a poem, whether a song, whether a mind or the spaces, those are in teaching.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.660
 All five perfect places, perfect teaching, perfect the teaching, perfect the retinal,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.780
 perfect the time. Seeing those things clearly that, and it is not just that we are making

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:51.260
 up that. According to the teaching, reality, everything in that status is not really we're

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.980
 making up because why we did not see or why we don't feel? Because due to the dualities.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:06.140
 Duality is like cataracts. Cataracts is the blocks, the reality where the natures are.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.420
 We can't really throw the powerful means of the teaching of the skilful means and the

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:17.660
 systems immediately break through that duality and with doubt and hesitations and the embarrassing

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:26.500
 the true qualities as it is, as there. And that is known as five perfect. We those all

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.220
 thought and then we go to these teachings. This teaching is of course you all know is

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:39.740
 actually teachings discovered by the great master. The new look up and a new my teaching

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.220
 that I mean, this generally maybe we talk, I talk this, this teaching is again teaching

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.060
 of the gracious teacher. But I checked them and what I checked them and they gave varieties

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:57.300
 of the teachings. All those and those teachings are in a combined or concluded in the nine

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.860
 Jana teachings that you may be whenever you already know that. Nine Jana teachings, all

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:11.780
 those teachings that what Buddha gave at the age 35 when he reached enlightenment and until

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:21.140
 age 81 or 82, she recorded different scholars where they explain it. So give the teachings.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:30.580
 All those teachings are put together as put together as Jana level and the nine Jana teachings,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:38.340
 nine Jana teachings. Among the nine Jana teachings, this teaching, what we're going through or

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:47.180
 what we're practicing, what we're going to go over this is the nine Jana, the big pinnacle,

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:53.660
 big of the teachings, which is called Rokti teaching of course you all know. Rokti teaching

00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:00.220
 also divided in the three sections and those sections are known as the same day or mind

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:08.100
 sections, space sections and the pit instruction sections. And the pit and the second teaching

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:16.740
 also divided into the four groups, four sections, outer section, inner section, cigarette section

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:25.900
 the mostly cigarette pit instruction sections. This teaching what we're going through is pit

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.260
 instruction section, the most cigarette teaching, the fourth one, fourth one, essence of the

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:39.540
 teachings. And the teaching is that there's nothing higher, deeper, more powerful, more

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:47.940
 direct teaching than this teaching. Even we meet Buddha, actually Buddha, or even someone said,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:55.700
 even one person Buddha come together, discuss it, how the best teaching to present to all the

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:55.940
 beings,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:04.140
 to get enlightenment so quickly or so fast. There's nothing else besides this teaching,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.460
 Jokti teaching, this teaching what we discuss or what we're going through, really a Kona

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:18.780
 teaching. So therefore feel joy, appreciation, how fortunate we are, how really we are,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:28.540
 our triggers, nuggety triggers, are rolling in front of our doors or our hands. How special,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:37.380
 kind of activated of joy and fresh feeling and embracing that with joy, devotion, courage,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:46.080
 commitment, determination, and joyful effort for the Dharma, for the virtues. That's how we

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.780
 continue.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:52.940
 So this teaching is, that's the essence. That teaching came to it a bit again. I mean,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:12:00.540
 generally my teaching obtains to three lineages, mind-to-mind transmission lineages, symbolic

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:07.660
 transmission lineage, and oral transmission lineage. This has all those lineage teachings,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:14.300
 condense all that three lineage teachings. With this teaching brought in the Tibet by the great

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:20.180
 master, Guru Brahma Sambhava, and as well as the great master, Bhimala Mathuram, and as well as

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:28.180
 the great master to be the translate of Verojaanam and great Dzokhi masters. This particular Dzokhi

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.700
 teaching I'm talking about, otherwise generally teaching all that renowned is the great master

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:40.540
 Shanda Raghida. But Dzokhi teaching itself, that both. And those teachings are transmitted through

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:48.980
 the Tibet with those three ways. Those are known as the Kama, oral transmission lineage,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:57.060
 then my transmission lineage, and the hidden discovered lineages. Hidden was hidden or the

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.820
 pure region, maybe I should say pure region lineages. So Kama lineage, then my lineage,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:11.780
 and pure region lineages, three lineages. And Kama means oral transmission, from A to A's,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:20.500
 or from the mouth to A, and promote to the A. Or that as a common way, students, from the master

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.610
 to receive the student, and the student practices with joy, in courage, in commitment, and

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.580
 inspiration

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:35.300
 with joy, as we'll be discussing, and they got realization actually. And they shared that with

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:43.700
 others, as exactly as they received from their Gary Masters, teachers, with joy, with devotions,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:51.220
 with humble, with symbol, drawn to earth, earth with compassion, with the loving kindness,

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:58.580
 transmitted that to the student. And the students also received that way, and practiced that way,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:05.620
 and transmitted. Those are known as Kama lineage, oral transmission lineage. So that means its

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:14.180
 authentic lineage came from the Buddha Shakyamuni, or Buddha Samyantabhadra, and Gaurabhema Samyava

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:14.180
,

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:22.100
 never diluted, never spoiled by the intellectual attitude, thought, or this, that, and those,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:31.300
 diluted. Is the still, clean, pure water, water, or the still in the teaching said,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:40.070
 at call it waters, perfect and natural as it was, as it is, it will be continued. How that happened

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.180
?

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:50.660
 We did every practitioners, keep with joy, precious, devotions, and richness, with appreciation,

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:59.540
 really kept that teaching to the core of their heart, and practices, got some realizations,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:08.100
 and then shared to the others, and they continued. That's called pure Kama lineage,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:16.420
 oral transmission lineage. So this teaching is pure teachings from the Buddha, or Samyantabhadra,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:23.940
 or the Buddha Shakyamuni, Gaurabhema Samyama, there's nothing diluted. There's no need to

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:33.220
 change the teachings. Emotions are same. All the sentient beings, past sentient beings, emotions,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:39.290
 present sentient beings, emotions, future sentient beings, emotions, and the duality, it's the same

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.460
.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:48.740
 Same with this water, glacier water is same. It's of the purpose to removing the thirst,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:57.700
 and helping to the irrigations, and nurturing the earth, same water. We don't have to dilute it.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:03.060
 Now, purports say more understanding than what they call the organic things, not organics.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.540
 Maybe before we thought all this changing is good, all that, but now people see more and

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:15.060
 more, they get more smart. Same way, this teaching is organic teachings,

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.060
 from continuing. Until now, never need changes.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:29.780
 Conception, the duality is, it's conception. What that means? Duality is based on ignorance.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:38.180
 Inference, darkness, not knowing, is dilemmas, is the presumptions.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:46.100
 Presumptions. Teaching is the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, some, all the Buddha,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:52.420
 some of the Buddha, all of them give this teaching, knowing the words of them,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:59.700
 knowing, seeing exactly things as it is. Not just only words with compassion.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:09.300
 The compassion that has no partialities, no discriminations, and share that teaching.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:16.180
 Combined, so good with the rasim, that others say perfect, meaning of everything.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:22.820
 What that means? Everything. Relay truth, absolute truth, exactly as it is.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:29.220
 There is no break, broke, blockages, that not knowing something.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:38.180
 Everything see clearly, perfectly, in one, that instance, without effort, without hardships.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:49.060
 Brilliant. In the teaching, the Buddha sees things clearly as it is crystal ball on this palm,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.140
 crystal ball, totally see.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:59.620
 Great teaching. That's not just the wisdom, intelligence, as is it compassion.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.260
 Has no self-importance,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:14.500
 nor any negative condensations, negativeities, pure compassion for all the beings,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:23.940
 without any discriminations. That great being, or great and simple, beautiful being

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:30.500
 of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Gaurabaya Masambha, all give the teachings.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:38.100
 So therefore, this continued Gama teaching is perfect, like clean water teachings.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.380
 And the Thelma teaching is, of course, you all know, barely. Of course, this happened during

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.860
 the Buddha Shakyamuni and before too, but it's one of the hallmark activities of the great

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:55.620
 master, second Buddha, Gaurabaya Masambha, and with assistance with the

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.220
 what's from Dakini Shim Sahaja. And he did all these teachings, so many teachings,

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:08.340
 thinking to the future purpose, or seeing the future needed, needed for the sentient beings,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:14.580
 and he did so many Thelma teaching, of course, we all know. And you heard, we heard so many,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:20.660
 and also really we see some of those amazing objects, what they discovered, those teachings.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:28.740
 And so that Thelma teaching, that is also not diluted, exactly taught by the Gaurabaya Masambha,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:36.180
 or Buddha, and transcribed, exactly the teaching, what said in the teaching,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:43.840
 those are called authentic thelms, exactly follow the instructions, teachings of the Gaurabaya Mas

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.260
ambha,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.540
 great Ma Vastam Dakini Shim Sahaja's teachings, revealed that. And those are Thelma lineage is

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:58.180
 known as very close lineage, so that means it's not long distance lineage, that means what?

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:03.860
 But the Thelma lineage is, that's the back, for example, the Buddha Shakyamuni, if we go back there

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:03.860
,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:14.020
 at least 3,600 years ago. But Thelma lineage is that Maripa Masambha came in Tibetan, according to

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:21.540
 the history around eight centuries. That time, Maripa Masambha and the Muslim Dakini Shim Sahaja,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.740
 other great, those disciples, the hard disciples, hidden the Thelma teachings,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.060
 transmitted all the teachings, the empowerment and talking to those individuals at that time,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.980
 those great thelms, and said, "You will reward these Thelma teachings in the future generations."

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:46.900
 This and that times, that times. And entrust to them, to those beings. And those

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.700
 beings are already enlightened beings, and their great bodies are the enlightenment

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:58.500
 and basically then emanated for the purpose of the future generation or throughout centuries.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.140
 And then reward Thelma teachings. And so that means very close lineage of Thelma teachings,

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:11.300
 that means, Parangarpa Masambha and Yixin Sahaja, to that theorem. So there is like, maybe that

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:18.510
 theorem come, for example. Thelma came in the 19th century, or early 20th century, that we all know

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.580
.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:26.580
 And Thelma has all the transmissions of the Thelma at that time. And so this, between there is many

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:26.580
,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:34.100
 many hundred years between that century and the 19th century or 20th centuries. But yet,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:43.060
 lineage is so fresh, so connected, and revered. Therefore, in the teaching of the Thelma teaching

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:52.420
 is so fresh, even the warm breath of the Dakini is not the same page. So fresh. It's just a newly

00:21:52.420 --> 00:22:01.620
 cooked oven food, right, put it in your dinner tables. And to for use of you, for use of our self.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:10.420
 How that is really called closed lineages. And then pure vegan lineage, lineage again is similar.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:18.260
 Because these thelma are already enlightened beings. There are, many of those are emanations

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:24.550
 of the 25 disciples, one of the, one, one, whatever they are. And the Dunyun Rongan is the eman

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:24.820
ation,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:34.020
 renowned emanation of the Drosi Cechong Lotta, as well as His Holiness Dunyun Rongan's emanation.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:41.680
 So they're already enlightened beings, enlightened beings. And then the previous of the Drosi Cech

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:41.700
ong

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.660
 Lotta in the teaching, life story of the His Holiness Dunyun Rongan, Dunyun Rongan of Dunyul

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.940
 Rongas said, like for example, great master Sarahas, great one of the 80 Mahasadas of the,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:01.460
 of the India Sarahas. So forth, really all those enlightened beings are reincarnated,

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:07.140
 manifested by the comparison to benefit for the beings one after another. And then

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:18.580
 19th century, the Dunyun Rongans. So his realization is a pure vision. What that also means is that

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:27.540
 indicated there is two visions in pure vision and pure vision. This is pure vision. What is the

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:36.660
 vision of the Buddhas, Gurba and Masambhava? Pure vision. Our vision of this world, this world

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:46.260
 in pure vision, in pure. And what that great and the Buddha teaching or the great master material

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:53.300
 said, according to the realization of the sentient beings, at least there is three visions.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:24:04.340
 In pure vision, mixture vision and pure vision. And in pure vision, what we have

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:13.140
 in pure vision, our vision is the vision of the duality that completely fresh and not

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:22.660
 destroyed or not damaged, even not crumbling, crumbling, fresh, naked, intact, duality visions.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:31.620
 We see things are then in pure and very regiment, ups and downs, challenges, all that.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:41.780
 And mixture vision is the bodhisattvas. Those are first brumis or the allocation part,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:48.660
 accumulation parts. Seeing part of the first brumis, second brumis, third brumis,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:56.260
 those visions are mixture visions. Pure in pure because they're more cleaned,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:02.660
 more purified, their dualities. Therefore, visions are coming bright and bright.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.540
 And then Buddha's vision, enlightenment is pure vision.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:18.340
 Pure vision. Buddha's vision, this universe is pure land. Poems are, as in the teaching

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:28.180
 making, the ongoing God by the end of the world teaching making, poems are the poem. Poems,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:35.290
 what's called poem aggregates, peeling aggregates, all those aggregates, five aggregates, as we

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:35.700
 heard

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:43.940
 so many times, we read five Diana Buddhas. Five element is the five Pima Buddhas. This is not just

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:52.980
 its stories, reality really it is according to teaching. But we don't see it because of dualities.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:01.780
 Buddha see, even in the Gharbha teaching, one in the teaching said, even the Buddha is looking

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:08.100
 at something or not in pure, cannot find. Everything is pure, that enlightened states.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:16.580
 That is true. That is our future visions, our vision when we practice meditators.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:27.490
 So these teaching, instead of the in that state of the realization, then this teaching came

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:27.700
 appeared.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:34.980
 That is what this teaching is. So now I'm going to talk too much about generally what we went

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:40.500
 last year. We started this teaching last year and we went through through. I mean, this has

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:48.180
 what's called this teaching of the Shirek Durya Nombu. Shirek Durya Nombu, Hiawa Zhen

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:58.020
 Evenness has at sections or at chapters. And we went last year, the first title, and then

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:05.060
 then the home age, pure home age and how this teaching appeared with the five pathways or how

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:11.300
 this teaching appeared, those we went through. And then we came on the teachings on this, like

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:17.540
 particularly teachings on how to continually carry, at the beginning, the practitioners

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:23.780
 carry on this teaching really with the mind, with the conceptions, with the mind.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:32.500
 So conception as part, how we move forward in that way. And now we go to the to the last year,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:39.460
 we stopped here. So I'm going to go from there, trying to go from there. And then we go this way,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:47.860
 this way and the page where we are. I think many of you have these books. So then this is where we

00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:16.180
 go. I think page 11. Page 11. And, and, and he has page 11. According to this is page 11,

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:26.260
 conceptual thought says, therefore, there are non conceptions, non conceptions. And, and so now

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:32.100
 this is, as I said, this generally, of course, a big in the practice, you know, so when we practice

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.100
,

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.340
 even in the Dokhin, we need to understand of the how to stabilize our mind.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.940
 Without the stabilizing our mind and the realization of the Dokhin or the Tukchu, teaching won't

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.180
 come

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:54.820
 easily then. So therefore we need to have more stabilized meant. And therefore, in this teaching,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.660
 we already went last year. And of course, we all know, we discussed with the Shamatha meditation,

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:07.700
 explainer of the Shamatha meditation. Shamatha meditation means Shamatha is a Sanskrit word,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:19.380
 which means abiding calmly, abiding calmly, abiding calmly in one single status. That means

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:30.100
 calm means no conceptions, turbulence conceptions. And the conceptions of the, of the past,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:37.780
 conceptions of the future, conceptions of this present time, no conceptions. We relax. In order

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:44.180
 to do this practice, of course, again, every practice begins with good motivations, as we

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.860
 discussed earlier, and you all know, with good motivation. Really, first they have kind of sit

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:57.540
 down on the cushion or the chair, comfortably, relaxedly, comfortably, and bring up more

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:04.260
 beautiful intention thought, as we discussed that, beautiful devotions, bodhicata thought,

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:10.260
 really for the strong presence of the Gurbama sambhava. It's separated with your root teachers,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:16.020
 really for the strongly, and Gurbama sambhava is embodiment of all Buddhas of the past,

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:22.500
 present and the future, that come together in one singular. Not just the Buddha, all the

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:29.940
 of the rafudas come together on one single state as some Gurbama sambhava. Gurbama sambhava is

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:36.980
 transcendent western rainbow body of love and compassion, compassion and the rainbow bodies,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:44.980
 seeing in front of their right, seeing that image right in front of it. As moment we have

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:51.540
 the confidence, we have the atrocities, without the disturbed by the doubt and hesitation,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:57.300
 really in the teachings, that Buddha has no distance. Moment, right that moment,

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:04.180
 Buddha will be right in front of us. In front of that, then feel strong presence, as I said,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:12.260
 with really joy and appreciation. And also pray, may I actualize realization of the true nature

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:18.660
 in this lifetime. May I become the one of the very beautiful persons to benefit all living beings,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:25.140
 really by the blessings of you. May I actualize the truth, this our one own Buddha nature,

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:33.380
 discover that. And all those, and then do some prayers, as you know, seven line prayers, all the

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:40.020
 mantras of the Gurbama, really strongly, sincerely. And then Gurbama sambhava is all, all with all,

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:46.420
 receiving those blessings, lighted at the window of teachings, or in guru yoga practices, guru yoga

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:53.540
 practice, and may merge in Gurbama sambhava to your own nature of the mind, to find and dissolve,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:00.820
 dissolve. Now, Gurbama sambhava is all your root teachers, all the object where effort is not

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:08.340
 outside. It's completely merged with your own natural mind. For that reason, he's only doing

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:18.260
 your teaching in a short window teaching. Behold the true absolute path. Behold the empty, absolute

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:34.740
 Behold the emptiness, absolute true path of the true Lama. Behold. So that means what?

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:48.420
 Now, behold your own nature of the mind. Relax. Nature. At that time when our mind is due to all

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.220
 this consumption, the turbulence of the past, the habit, dependence, won't stay.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:02.580
 Even you want to stay. That means even want to stay one point, you won't stay. For that reason,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:10.500
 then use some supporters of the objects. Those are you all know, many of you know, so I won't go

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:18.820
 more details on this. Object. Focus on that. That means what? You're concentrating to that object.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:30.100
 Whatever you put right in front of you, maybe one meter or one and a half meter in front of you,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:39.300
 you put some objects, small objects, concentrated on that. That means your mind is with two eyes,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:46.740
 two eyes, and the two eyes are on the triangle level and pointing, looking to that object,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:54.260
 and hold that support for your concentrations. That's called

00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:01.060
 commutator or shamata with the objects. Whatever you like to use with the breathings,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.780
 also use breath. That means again, the same posture, same thing.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:16.690
 Relax on the chair or in the cushion, comfortably, softly, and then breathing count from the nost

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:16.740
rils.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:25.860
 And don't change the breathings. Exhale what you're used to and calm the breathings or

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:34.900
 follow the breathings. Breathing in and out or exhale, inhale. Follow the country, gently,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:48.980
 peacefully. How long you can do. Even sometimes they can't. How long we can follow without mind

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:56.100
 moved from the concentrate on the breathing. Concentrate on breathing. And so that is called

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:02.340
 shamata with the support. Meditate anything. And then there's many techniques. I'm sure you

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:10.180
 all know those, and many times in teaching said also the great master Vimalamata mentioned

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:17.540
 use the Buddha images. Right in front of you put small tables and put small Buddha statues

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:26.340
 and concentrate on the third eye support. And the great master Ragaakse in the teaching said

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:33.540
 concentrate on the heart of the Buddhas. Buddhas, he mentioned Amitabha, put right in front of you,

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:41.300
 Amitabha, concentrate on the heart of the Buddha or third eye support of the Buddha. Concentrate.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:48.580
 Buddha is calm and peaceful through them. And Buddha is always on the meditation.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:59.780
 That means Buddha never moved out of the nature. It's all time. Whether Buddha sitting, whether

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:05.860
 Buddha walking, whether Buddha is discussing, whether Buddha is engaging with some other

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:15.140
 Sangha members or students, Buddha is all the time in that natural status. And seeing Buddha

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:22.500
 is making his brains calm and peaceful. Really it's beautiful. Buddha is soothing,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:32.020
 calming, and just feel strong presence and concentrate on that. Those are meditation

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:41.140
 with the supporters or shamata with the supporters. When you don't need the support, then meditate.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:49.380
 Just relax as your mind. Realize. Again, the posture, everything is the same. Relax.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.540
 When you relax in the meditation, stay here, then initiate the word. He said

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:03.460
 conception toward, cease. Then it will stop all conceptions. How long we can stay,

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:10.660
 actually cease the conceptions. For example, for beginner practitioners, for many of us, really,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:19.220
 how long we can stay. That means one minute, two minutes, three minutes. How long we can do

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:28.260
 the shamata meditation without our mind is disturbed by our own thoughts. How long it stays.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:37.700
 And that then gradually is of course extended, extended, stabilized. At the beginning of time,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:44.260
 there is many of those in the teaching said. Beginning of time, we meditate. When we do the

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:52.100
 shamata meditation, the moment we sit down and meditate, it looks like our mind is so active,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:59.860
 so active. And what in the teaching said, mentioned those, is like gushing the blocks

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:07.620
 from the mountains. It's really, we see this. So agitated, the mind is so active, can't stand it.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:13.860
 Even one second looks like. In the teaching said, every teaching said,

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:21.190
 that is not something you cannot meditate. That is the first sign of the mind is now we are stabil

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.700
izing.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:29.300
 We are taming the mind. When you see, the more mind is always being like that active,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:36.900
 but we did not notice it. When you begin to relax it, then we see that. So that is good.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:45.460
 Now we are noticing of the how our mind is active. Then that become calmer and calmer,

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.260
 calmer and calmer. In the teaching making, there's five different ways, kind of like

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:58.660
 experience goes. Finally, it comes as like the, what's called, like bond or like that has no

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:05.780
 disturbances. When you look far away, like it's so calm and peaceful, it looks like. But when you

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:13.300
 come close to the light, there's still ripples. That is also called the fourth stage of the

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:22.260
 meditation. Then, continue to meditate. Then it becomes completely calm, like mountains. Those are

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:29.540
 in the teaching, the different stages, but without tired, without bored, with joy, with devotion,

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:38.170
 with both each other, with really activated. This is the first time I am training my conception

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:38.500
 mind.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:45.860
 I am taming the mind. What the great teacher, brother said in the teaching, he said,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:54.500
 "Tame your mind. This is my teaching. Tame your own mind." So that means, taming our own mind.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:05.540
 This is so powerful, so special. When we turn our mind, then beauty of the mind,

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:14.260
 the nature of the mind will shine. Then it's like coming out. What are the beauty of the

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:25.940
 nature of the mind? Shenyang, joy, appreciation, love, kindness, more patience, more tolerance,

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:36.580
 more respect, more humble, more simple. Really, all those comes. Then even the emotional things

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:43.460
 happen externally, not going to immediately agitate it, or immediately recognize the weakness

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:50.020
 of our own self. We are able to liberate it, or we can handle that. Those are the signs

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:57.780
 of the good practitioners. Then we continually meditate. "Here, sit here, sit there." All that,

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:04.180
 for everyone, when the connection of then, the bliss, emptiness, and the luminosity,

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:11.940
 all those will come. This is in the teaching said, that every teaching, all the meditation

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:19.060
 instruction teaching said, "When you meditate, make your mind become more calm and peaceful

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:25.140
 in the samatha or the zokki meditation." What were you doing? The zokki is the vipashana meditation

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.380
.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:33.540
 So whatever that means, samatha in meditation and the samatha, what? Samadam is a calming,

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.460
 abiding calm. Vipashana means, in Sanskrit, seeing the nature of the mind.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:48.500
 And zokki is what? Union of the vipashana and samatas. Zokki meditation is union.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:57.060
 It's calm. It's peaceful. It's seen clearly as its own naturals. So at the time, at that time,

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.580
 when we are good meditation, or everything is happening, then this experience will come in the

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.020
 teaching. Every teaching mentioned, every practitioner mentioned that it will never come.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:15.680
 What are those experiences? As teaching said here, experience of the blissfulness, experience of

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:15.940
 the

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:26.100
 clarity, experience of the non-duals, no thought. Those all will come. Naturally, it's not

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.420
 something

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:36.340
 that we have to make trying to come. When we are meditating and practicing, this naturally will

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.140
 come

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:48.180
 as part of the development, sign of the development of our practices. And so now here, even those

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:57.140
 comes, third line explaining, become as an object of the attachment desires. And we start

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:08.100
 attachment to those experiences. Then it become handedness. Then it become obstacles. It become

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:15.780
 not obstacle immediately, but it become long run its obstacles. Obstacles of the development of

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:24.740
 the realizations, and then obstacles of the delay of this, our progresses. It will be bliss. So

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:35.700
 therefore, and then, so every and here mentioned, and what that happened, then I'm in teaching said

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:35.700
,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:41.220
 and they will become the object of attachment desire, experience of the painful,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:57.240
 and mental body speaking mind, arising sporadically in the stages. So all these experiences will

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:57.460
 come.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:05.220
 Different experiences will come, show up. This is not just only the two meditators.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:12.020
 Every practitioner will have those experiences. So many different experiences really will come.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:23.540
 At the beginning time, this is the blessfulness, and clarity, and the non-duals comes. But then

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:31.940
 we continue to hold on to that, that, and then that those meditation become very, very

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:42.180
 radicals, or very, very, what's called, unstable. And so many different experiences, so many

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.660
 different

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:50.980
 feelings, experiences, conceptions, comes one after another. As in the teaching said here,

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:58.340
 then there's no regulations. No regulations, all those will come up, everything. And this is what

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:04.100
 the teaching said. For example, "Buddhakhyakya Muni," for example, "Buddhakhyakya Muni is even

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:11.060
 his reaching enlightenment under the body to him, is the last portion, stages of his enlightenment.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:20.580
 According to the teaching, Buddha accumulated 23 eons," sorry, not 23, I'm sorry, "three countless

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:27.940
 eons, three countless eons, Buddha accumulated merits to reach enlightenment. That his final

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:37.140
 moment of the getting enlightenment, then you're often called "Maraskem," disturbed.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:46.500
 This is vision of the Buddha. It's not just happening externally in all the villages that

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:56.180
 inhabitants can see. It's in a way, in a battle, battle. It is. That's what the, in a Buddha

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.900
 teaching automatically, even in the beginning of the practice, we go through many different

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:07.460
 stages of the unconscious challenges. Those are what in the teaching, external challenges,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:15.060
 inward challenges, and secret challenges. External challenges, for example,

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.740
 I'll use an example of Buddha. External challenges, Buddha's vision,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.540
 So, those old maras, post they came pleasing ways,

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.740
 very trying to, trying to disturb one way or another.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.540
 Post is a very pleasing ways.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:46.220
 Very sensual, sensual, sensual, sensual, sensual, sensual, sensual, sensual,

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:54.060
 sensual ways, poem, song, smell, taste, touch.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.540
 Those all came in the Buddhas.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.540
 Also in the teachings, many great brat-grasanas can see,

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.460
 those are what in the teachings said in the Buddhism.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.100
 Those are called demon of the destructions.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.740
 The disturbing even looks like a period

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.860
 where a sensual place of object is appealing things,

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.980
 but they are the demon.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:24.380
 One demon is disturbing our realization, progresses,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.500
 is pulling down.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.260
 That is really all that.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.340
 And then that didn't happen.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.700
 Then rub things came.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.580
 And all the Maras, Thoden Maras.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.220
 And the great Masala Bhama, sorry,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:45.260
 Malarepa also experience when you read life's role of him.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:50.580
 When one time he went, went to get the collective firewood,

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:55.180
 went out of his caves, went to collect the firewood,

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.180
 when he come back inside,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:03.140
 there is a strange being sitting on his cushions.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.100
 And there are the sides, as big as the thumb sides,

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:14.820
 but eyes are big as like balls, the cups.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.140
 It's made of wooden balls, balls.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:23.060
 And sitting in his room, his bed, his cave,

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.740
 when he come back to the bed.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.060
 So what Malarepa did, he started chanting some mandaras

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.820
 and all that things.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.260
 And they didn't go.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.940
 They so get more stronger, more stronger,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.260
 even they kind of act more glorified.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.860
 Then he finally thought, "Oh, my great teacher,

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:50.500
 the Marpa introduced everything is mind.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.900
 Mind is empty.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.940
 Everything what you see is display of the mind.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.860
 Mind is empty.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.420
 This is not externally existing.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:05.660
 It is my own mind imagination with that realization."

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:12.340
 So he built up his wrist of the realization and went inside.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.660
 They all trembling and become small and small.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.980
 And they disappeared.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.700
 They disappeared.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.860
 So this is externally appearing.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.220
 In the Buddha, in the teaching, he said,

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.660
 "Elos Regum II, so many demons coming and throwing

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.540
 all these things."

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.700
 That is external.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:40.900
 Inwardly, all this again bumpy, and that practitioners

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.780
 become kind of very, again, physical experience,

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.460
 unhealthy and suffering, difficulty, troubles,

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.180
 and all these things.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.820
 All that kind of things, really things,

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.060
 one after another, kind of unexpected happening.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.180
 Those are called inner obstacles.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.100
 Signal obstacle is mind.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:10.780
 Mind has become more agitated, more doubt, more hesitation,

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.260
 hesitation to our side, to the teaching,

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.300
 to the practices, the teachings.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.900
 And all the thoughts, really, the consulsions

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.780
 are troubling in the mind.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.540
 And then maybe in the kind of dream,

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.220
 the vision of why you practice and why you need meditation,

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.700
 why you come here, what are you doing this?

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.300
 And all those, so many things in the teaching he said.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.540
 It's just like, all that things comes.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.820
 What is this?

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.620
 It's testing our practices.

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.620
 In the Buddha teaching, in the Pandya Paramada teaching,

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.620
 teaching said, those who practice,

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:52.820
 the Pandya practices, demons started crying.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.220
 Those obstacles started crying.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.500
 They said, oh, I cannot defeat that individual.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.020
 Now they practice the Pandya Paramada.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.820
 And then they're desperate needed.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.020
 And they're trying to show some more strength

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.260
 in doing different things, trying to erase the doubt

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.540
 and hesitation in the mind of that practitioner of Bodhisattva,

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.340
 path of practicing the Pandya Paramatas.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.140
 But the great practitioners, seeing those things,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.340
 get more courage, more commitment, more confidence,

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.300
 and continue meditating.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.220
 And then they can't do anything.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.660
 That great practitioner, Bodhisattva,

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:36.100
 are flying in the sky as the bird without any blockages

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.540
 of the hindrance.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.420
 Then they overcome all that.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.980
 This has happened many times.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.340
 So he has said, all that comes, comes.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.820
 And it is what?

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:53.540
 When you have the hops and long pole, whatever good this.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.820
 Then if you feel opposite those bad thinking and truly

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.980
 existing, then what will happen?

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.460
 Then you have gone after the hindrance

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.020
 and the dangerous, mysterious paths.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.740
 Then as you're gone, you really lost the controls.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:17.260
 Here, in the debate, it is called the kor-shor-nor.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:22.700
 And kor is, I think, astray, I think, astray.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.300
 And shor is the hindered.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.660
 And nor is the mistaking.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.900
 So kor is generally this kor.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:39.740
 I've simply translated kor means deleted.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.340
 If I translate it this way, my simple way.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.180
 Delaying.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.420
 Delaying.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.540
 Or distal, distals.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.300
 And kor-shor.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:57.340
 Shor means hindered.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.660
 And if I also translate it this way, shor means lost.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.060
 Lost.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.060
 Nor is then mistaking.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.060
 So this is kor-shor.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.660
 This is actually in the teaching,

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.100
 when you say mention, this is the practitioner.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:19.740
 So always there should be always third pole with this 3.3.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:26.420
 Detour and lost the control and mistakings.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:33.620
 What means delayed, or I translate it, detour or the delayed?

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.540
 This is a particularly, sometimes,

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:44.940
 the practitioner, mistakingly delayed or detoured

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.700
 by the three experiences.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.260
 Those three experiences are the blissful experience

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:59.460
 and clarity experience and no thought experience,

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.940
 as already mentioned earlier.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.900
 What means the blissfulness?

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.580
 Generally, in the great master, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:14.940
 in his teaching mentioned that blissfulness is not

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:19.860
 blissfulness of the sensual pleasure of blissful,

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.940
 or it is not bliss by the substances,

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.100
 if we take substances, something, and feel blissful.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.060
 This is not the bliss of that.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:36.580
 But this is the bliss of that when our meditations become

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:41.340
 strong or good, and you don't like to stop.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:46.100
 You feel so comfortable and calm and at peace,

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.260
 and you don't like to stop.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.380
 You can feel that.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.740
 That is the blissfulness.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.780
 So now, what is that?

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.020
 Why does it become the detour?

00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.540
 And we attach it.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.700
 We grasp it.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.460
 We like to have that more.

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.620
 Then it becomes delayed.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:14.100
 It detours our practice.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.460
 What means the detour, delayed?

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.260
 In the teaching of the print, it said,

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.620
 if you attach to the blissfulness,

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:27.460
 you will take rebirth in the desirums.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.700
 Desirums.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.180
 So instead of going--

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.500
 desirums is samsara.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.220
 Instead of going through beyond samsara,

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.900
 we are stopping in the samsara.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.980
 We are stopping on the resting area on the highways.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.260
 It's really nice looking.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.220
 I think we reached the destination.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.020
 We're just going to rest here.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:52.740
 But your destination is quite far.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.220
 So then we delay it.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:00.180
 And then we bond back to the desirums.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:05.820
 So that's why in teaching, it said, don't attach it that way.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.900
 And its coming is good.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.940
 Having those experiences is good.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.580
 That is a sign of progress, but it's not the final goal.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:18.380
 But therefore, continue to make it.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.460
 Continue to keep up that.

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:29.540
 And the second is, then, is the second delay is the clarity.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.140
 Clarity means what?

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.940
 In the Grand Master's [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.540
 in his teaching.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:44.740
 It is clarity means pre-promda, pre-promda, dullness,

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:53.420
 and poginess, pre-promda status, and able to relax our mind

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:58.700
 or the meditation with calm and clear status.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.580
 That is clarity, clear status.

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.940
 Everything that clarity is, again,

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.060
 to this kind of seeing different images,

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:14.580
 seeing different vision is clarity and holding onto that.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.500
 That is the detox.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.780
 Again, it is a delay.

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.740
 That is a delay.

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.340
 And why that means delay?

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.060
 And we attach it to that.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.420
 In the teaching mentioned, we long attach it with that.

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.700
 We will bond, or that become the cause

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:37.380
 to rebirth in the poem rams.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.300
 Poem rams, there's three rams in the Buddhist open talks.

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.580
 Three rams.

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:48.740
 Three rams, desire rams, poem rams, poem-less rams.

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.180
 Those are innate.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.340
 Those come.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.380
 Those come.

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.460
 Some of them come.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.540
 Those are three rams.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:00.980
 So the first of a year more kind of appealing and a pleasure

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:07.100
 and experience and holding with the attachment of that please

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.420
 or comfortable experience of that,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.260
 that is then become the cause attached.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.740
 Then become the cause to take the rebirth in the desire rams.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:26.380
 And we attach it to that clarity, that clear and brilliant,

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.580
 free from the dullness, free from the pogginess

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.820
 of the meditation and feel this is ultimate

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.780
 and then kind of get attached with that.

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:42.700
 Then that become the, can be caused to birth to the poem rams.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.100
 Poem rams is according to teaching.

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:49.100
 Of course all this teaching is God's rams.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.300
 God's and particularly God's rams.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.180
 Desire rams has also God's rams too.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:59.940
 Those are called six levels of the desire rams of the gods.

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.020
 There's six rams.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:08.380
 And the poem rams is all God's rams in the teaching makings.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:14.620
 And then this non-dual thought means what?

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.940
 Non-dual thought, again great master Jing-Wen-Lung-Bai said,

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:26.340
 non-thought means the meditation state which is free from turbulence

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:31.780
 of the conceptions and movement of the thought.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:38.380
 Relaxing calmly in the clear state of the meditation, meditation,

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.300
 that is no thought.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.260
 No thought is not blank status.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:53.940
 No thought is not mindless status or has no mindfulness.

00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:02.820
 No thought means free from the turbulence of the conceptions.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:11.260
 Relaxing calmly, peacefully, or calmly in that clear state

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.740
 of the mind is the no thought.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:28.540
 That is not blank status, not neutral status or blockage status.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:34.300
 And we're thinking again, no thought state is a blank status.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.620
 Then kind of relax on that status more than that.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.620
 Then it can become caused to take the birth

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:50.420
 in the poem-less rams, even in the Psalm teaching making every continuous state

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.780
 that we become more dummy, more dummy.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:00.100
 It becomes like caused to take the birth, even in the animal rams,

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.820
 that no thought.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:06.500
 So therefore, every kind of field, those are the ultimate state.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.500
 And that's then in the teaching said here, here.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:16.100
 I kind of went a little bit more that is the astray, handed, and the dangerous mistake

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:22.660
 because it brings back to the samsara, samsara not going beyond the samsara.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:27.980
 For that reason, then here is the one technique that applies to everything,

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.780
 soul, essential point of the path.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:35.620
 Path is those all, whatever that is, the next page.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:41.820
 It's page 12 now. And in order to obtain, certainly experience those all,

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:48.340
 the happiness and peace, what's called the blessfulness and clarity

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:54.020
 and suffering, the difficulty, whatever that, all are unreal.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.380
 Impressions, the subtle experience.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:02.300
 And for that reason, understanding this, you will come.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.500
 Rest without rejecting, establishing or rejecting, accepting anything, anything.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:15.740
 And then relax and calm, pristine, clear, unimpeded state of the mind

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.620
 as it is relaxing in that status, that well.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.580
 Then I'm moving this page 12 in the middle of this line.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.940
 I said this is therefore is a single eye, single technique

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:33.700
 that will discriminate in the wisdom which will cut arrows

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.180
 in the divisions of all this, completely will destroy,

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.620
 toy, it will remove that.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:47.700
 So therefore, then meditate, exactly as you receive instructions.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:55.180
 Meditate calm and peaceful, relax as it is on this present status.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.860
 What N.M.M. teaching said that the mind, the nature of the mind is calm,

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:06.260
 nature of the mind is clarity, nature of the mind is fresh,

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.940
 nature of the mind is uncontrupted.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.860
 Relax in that natural state, relax and calmly,

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:24.820
 relax on the unconstructingly, relax as freshness, relax as it is.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:31.100
 Don't try to do something, relax as without any holding

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:36.180
 and freeing all the conceptions.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.940
 Then it really comes exactly to the nature of the mind.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:44.660
 Then it is really advancing.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.460
 And the nature of the mind, see the nature of the mind exactly as it is.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.540
 And that is then vipassana.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.300
 Nature is, as I said, fresh, naked, emptiness.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.300
 The nature of the mind is preformed to all those aspects.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.940
 What does that mean, the aspects in the teaching of the mind?

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.860
 I'm sure you heard that, you know that.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:14.620
 Existing, non-existing, neither and either.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.260
 That is the mind.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:21.300
 Existing is a conception, and not existing is a conception.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.580
 Neither is a conception.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:31.460
 And existing, non-existing, neither is a conception.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.100
 Conception.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.100
 Conception is what?

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.620
 Duality.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.980
 Duality is the cause of samsara.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:45.860
 Duality is unnatural according to the teaching.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.100
 That is really, we deluded from that.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.820
 We carried the force of duality from the beginning times.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:05:01.980
 Now we are reversing back to the nature by the powerful method of the Dzogchi teachings.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:08.780
 Ovejena teaching, which is known as the union of skillful means and versatile combined together.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:16.900
 We return it with simple, easy, direct, yet so powerful.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:23.380
 And therefore what in the teaching said, there is nothing to do.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.100
 Just be in the natural status.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:32.060
 Great Masala Gurba Ema Samba said in one of his teachings, people said, "I don't know

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.420
 how to meditate."

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.580
 There's nothing to meditate.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.780
 Just relax, he said.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:43.580
 Relax on the natural as it is.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:54.380
 And freshly, nakedly, openly, and naturally, and not holding anything.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.980
 That is the freshness.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.820
 That is the nakedness of it.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.300
 That is what we really advance.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300
 We want to advance.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.340
 When we meditate in the practice, continue like that.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.940
 Then what is arising?

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:19.780
 More joy, more appreciation, more devotions, more great force, gratitude, all those beautiful

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.140
 things really come.

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:27.060
 And then also begin to see things are all as magic displays.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:33.060
 Magic displays, magic comes, magic is here, and magic goes.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:38.500
 Nothing is permanent existing at all.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.860
 Existing is the magic displays.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:46.940
 All intermingled with interdependent co-ordination or interconnected.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:53.660
 This interconnected also in the very end of the teaching mentioned as illusion nets.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.660
 Nets, so many things are connected med.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.660
 But it's illusion.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.820
 Illusion, it doesn't mean it's not going to function.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:09.380
 It's going to function exactly as it is on the illusion wall.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.500
 And that is when you have realization.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:16.340
 That is not illusion, that nets of the wisdom.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.340
 It is a wisdom.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:21.300
 Very much your wisdom and compassion.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.060
 That is how it is.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.320
 So that, that, that.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:37.140
 And then next one is, next one is then, therefore, I think we went through this, and some, some

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:43.980
 having become distant from the authentic spiritual friend, authentic spiritual friend.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:51.860
 So this authentic spiritual friend is generally is spiritual friend, yeah, spiritual friend

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:58.700
 is in Sanskrit, I think is known as Kalyanamatras, Kalyanamatras.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:05.900
 And if I translate it roughly that, I mean it's intubated, translated Giphi, Gebhini.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:13.580
 If we translate it that into English, friend of virtues, friend of virtues.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:20.700
 Friend of virtues is called in a common name in the Vinaya teaching and the Suttara teaching

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:24.620
 is teacher, teacher is spirit.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:33.780
 So therefore it is indicating that we all need, need spiritual friends or we need teacher.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:42.140
 Any teacher is generally in the Buddha teaching, often mentioned, you must contract with spiritual.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.180
 That's what Buddha said.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:52.860
 Spiritual friend, until we reach enlightenment, Sancha Matu, but Gebhini in tears, until

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:58.980
 you reach enlightenment or as long as you are on the path, we need spiritual friend,

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.940
 we need teachers.

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:05.700
 So there is spiritual friend, talking about the spiritual friend.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:14.580
 In the Buddha teaching, general explained of the spiritual friend, there is three types

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.620
 of the spiritual friends.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:27.240
 The ordinary spiritual friend and then bodies are, or four types of the spiritual friends.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:34.460
 The ordinary spiritual friends, bodies are those spiritual friends, namakaya spiritual

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.740
 friends and the sambhokaya spiritual friends.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:48.540
 Those all four are known as poor spiritual friends or teacher or the guru, whatever we

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.540
 named.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.460
 Those are different terminologies.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:56.140
 So there's four, poor spiritual friends in that way.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:02.580
 And who, how we can contract all these spiritual friends?

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:13.060
 Because since we are ordinary sentient beings, we cannot contract easily bodhisattva spiritual

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.900
 friend or virtuous friend.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.780
 We cannot contract namakaya spiritual friend.

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:24.780
 We cannot contract with sambhokaya spiritual friend.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:29.620
 So where we, how we, who we can contract?

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:36.180
 Our kababali range, range of our kababali we can contract.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:42.700
 The spiritual friend, the ordinary spiritual friend, those are in a Tibetan word, sosu

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:51.020
 jivu gavu hinyi, sosu jivu gavu hinyi, sosu jivu, I'm translating, ordinary, ordinary.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:57.460
 That means regular human beings, regular human beings, spiritual friend.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:06.460
 So now, mostly on this earth, I'm not talking all of them, but most of this earth, our teachers

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:15.140
 are accordant teaching, I'm talking, accordant teaching is ordinary sentient beings.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:23.420
 That means they are practitioners, they are dualities, they are not enlightened, they're

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.580
 just regular human beings.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:29.140
 Or even they're regular human beings.

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:35.460
 In the Buddha teaching mentioned, there's qualifications of that.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:40.740
 Again, there's numerous explanation of the, in the Buddha teaching, the qualification

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:48.700
 of the ordinary human beings, teachers, teachers, accordant, in the, accordant contracts, contracts

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:58.660
 of the three, three yanas, three yanas, ordinary teachers of the Vinayakshi schools, ordinary

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:06.620
 teachers of the Mahayana schools, only teachers of the, then very ordinary teachers, so they're

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:14.300
 like that, or ordinary teachers of the, yeah, those ordinary teachers.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:22.700
 And what in the teaching mentioned, there's many, many mentioned, and Vinaya teaching,

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:30.500
 I'm just trying to simplify, simplify, so what the ordinary teachers, teachers, they

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:40.940
 need, need, qualifications, what are qualifications, the qualifications of the, the moralities,

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:46.820
 qualifications of the concentrations and qualifications of the wisdoms.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:54.340
 Those are known as the, the, yeah, qualification of the morality, and qualification of morality

01:12:54.340 --> 01:13:02.220
 means who have the percept, who kept the percept, percept, whatever they are, whether they are

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:09.100
 under practitioners, whether they are Mahayana practitioners, Sutra Mahayana practitioners,

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:14.380
 whether they are Vinaya, that whatever, that lay practitioners, whatever they are, they

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:19.540
 kept the perceptus, observed the perceptus.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:25.900
 And then the qualification of the, of the concentrations, they have some realizations,

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:32.580
 understand, or good realizations, that's the best, realizations of the Samadhi meditation,

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:38.860
 Vipassana meditations, good meditations of the qualifications.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:45.860
 And then they had the qualifications of the, of the wisdoms, morality, that means understand

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:56.980
 the meaning of the teachings, all the teachings, and as well as also realization of the teachings,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:04.060
 realizations of the morality, realizations of the Samadhi's concentration, realizations

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:11.220
 of the, of the wisdoms, absolute truth, and I relate to some understand quite good.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:19.100
 So those are the three in Buddhism, what called three extra-only practices, morality,

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.820
 concentrations,

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.820
 and wisdoms.

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:28.500
 How that used extra-only practice of the morality, extra-only practice of the concentrations

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:33.540
 or the meditation, extra-only practice of the wisdoms, those are three.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.940
 Those are, if you summarize all that, what are those?

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:41.660
 Those are known as qualification of the realizations.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:50.900
 In the Buddhism, what in the teaching said, Buddha's teaching is, has true, teaching of

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:56.460
 the scriptural aspect and teaching of the realization aspect.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:02.500
 And that is innovative, known as the longer true, talk with you.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:08.660
 The scripture means teaching itself, books and volumes, all three, Pritakas, three, six,

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.620
 nine yanas, all those teachings.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:19.700
 And topa or realization means meaning of these teachings, some realization of that meaning

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:25.420
 of that, not just a word, not just only on the language and titles and all that, but

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.700
 realization.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:31.980
 And when you have those qualities, what has happened then?

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:38.420
 Your body becomes, that practitioner's body is, those spiritual friends, his body conduct

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:46.340
 is calmer, peaceful, and verbal speeches are calmer and peaceful.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:52.380
 Mind is also quite calmer, peaceful, some degree, because of realization of the true

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:00.580
 nature and less negative emotions or grasping, clinging, self-importance, attitudes, those

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.660
 are things.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:08.980
 So those are known as talk for realization, realization of the understanding of true nature.

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:16.060
 Then not just only the realization, you have the teachings of the, have the compassion.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:22.180
 Compassion that who are also really has compassion to teach and help in the sports.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:27.820
 And who has also courage in commitment patient, not born in a tide, but benefited from the

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:35.820
 others or upholding teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni or some of us, some

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.820
 of us.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:42.420
 And then who has also little more knowledge, more realization than ourself, ourself, Rigal

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.420
 Bhasa.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.100
 So there's little more that.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:50.720
 Those are the pre-subcalifications of the teachers.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:17:07.040
 In the Vedayana teaching, particularly in the Vedayana teaching, in the Maha, sorry.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:13.700
 In the, in a Tantra teaching mentioned, there is, at college, that was explained in the

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.980
 Nuhangarpa Tantra or the Maha Yoga Tantras, at qualification of the teachers.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:25.920
 Those are known as then these, one who hold three treasures, three treasures.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.580
 Those are the treasures of the will, that understanding of the inseparable or realization

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:46.980
 of the will, of the realization of the will, of the realization of the purity of all these

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:55.100
 phenomena existentities and equally or together with a union of this emptiness, emptiness

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:55.860
 realization.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:59.820
 So that means who has some realization of that, what that means actually?

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:07.500
 What that means, all this according Maha Yoga on a Tantra, all is enlightenment status.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:17.290
 So that means all is pure as we discussed earlier. All is pure. All the forms, I would get

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:18.460
 enlightened.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.340
 Five elements are enlightened.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.900
 See that as pure as it is.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:33.580
 Nature of that purity is emptiness, emptiness.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:38.940
 And there is true emptiness and purity of the inseparable.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:46.580
 So realization, the will, that will have the realization of the will seeing inseparable

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.700
 of the purity and the emptiness.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.980
 That is the post-treasure.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:02.700
 Second treasure is inseparable realization of the, of the visualization and completion

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.380
 stages, exactly inseparable, together.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:12.260
 Visualizations, of course, in Vedic energy, there is a lot of creation stage, meditation

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:18.580
 or visualizations and is a union with the completion stages.

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.540
 So that is second treasure.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:30.060
 Third treasure is, is the treasure of the keeping of the Samayas, general Samaya and

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:35.860
 Pacific Samayas of the different deities and the chitney, damsaikas.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:42.740
 So that is those are known as three treasures who have, who hold some relief of those three

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.780
 treasures.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:52.820
 And the next one, the fourth one, who receive the old empowerment teachings, empowerment,

01:19:52.820 --> 01:20:01.300
 and which is the empowerment, that's the beneficial empowerment and powerful empowerment, called

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:09.260
 the teaching, those, those are many explanations and performed empowerment, those empowerment

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:15.580
 and kept that.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:23.020
 And then who have also responsibilities, fourth one, no, no, fifth one, fifth one is responsible,

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:28.340
 who have the responsibility, responsible, who have keeping, keeping up the responsibility

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:34.820
 to keep up the lineage teachings, not neglected, exactly as it is keeping up the responsibility

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:41.660
 of the lineage teaching and taking care of the, those who are connected, those who are

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:47.820
 student, all the students who are connected, who cares, who cares the lineage teaching,

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:50.580
 who cares students.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.860
 And that is the fifth.

01:20:52.860 --> 01:21:01.500
 Sixth one is one who has understanding of the realizations, and who is expert or who

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:08.700
 has some knowledge of the, of the old, what's called his name, all the ritual objects, ritual

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:16.140
 objects, ritual implements, and the thomas, all that is.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:25.180
 And the next one is, is then who had always warm and warm hearted with the, with warm

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:31.740
 hearted with compassion.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:40.580
 And then the last one, who is also quite expert of the old Tantra teachings, Tantra teachings

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:48.660
 of the, of the Mahayoga, Anu-yoga, and the Ati-yoga teachings, or as a general, general

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:56.020
 teacher, those are teaching mentioned, mentioned at qualities of the way they are in the teachings.

01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:01.860
 And somehow we couldn't find all that at least who have the lineage teaching and keeping

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:10.100
 up the, of the Samaya and the responsibilities and with compassion, with compassion and being

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:16.820
 as good practitioners, being practiced, not just only talking, but practicing, practicing

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.820
 themselves.

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.700
 Those are the teachings said.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:28.740
 So those are, are that it's just the really, really of the, of the spiritual friend of

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.180
 the ordinary beings, ordinary beings.

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:40.660
 And again, this ordinary beings that we can contract, but this, the three other spiritual

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:47.820
 friends, according to teaching is difficult to find.

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.820
 We don't have the capabilities.

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:53.660
 If we have, if we have to have the body of the spiritual friends, you have to have realization

01:22:53.660 --> 01:23:01.700
 according to teaching is at least an application path or seeing path, path, I have five path,

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.300
 path according to that.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:08.740
 And then when you're in that ninth, boomie, tenth, boomie, then you can contract with

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.660
 the, with the Namakaya spiritual friends.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:18.300
 Then you're really like in the last stage of the boat, tenth boomies, then you can contract

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:23.460
 with Sambokaya spiritual friends.

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:30.740
 But otherwise we can, we don't have the capabilities, but according our range, our kind of way we

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:38.360
 can handle, we can contract is spiritual, only individually spiritual friend who has

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.660
 good qualities, good those qualities according to teaching.

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:49.700
 And the spiritual friend of the ordinary spiritual friend according to teaching is so important,

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.700
 so precious.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:24:00.560
 Because having contract with ordinary spiritual friends that will lead us able to contract

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:09.260
 with the bodhisattva spiritual friend, Namakaya spiritual friend, Sambokaya spiritual friend.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:16.340
 So therefore this first spiritual friend with ordinary is really crucial, so important.

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:22.540
 And therefore you should contract with full of joy, devotion, when you find, and that

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:26.900
 is what in the teaching mentioned is so important.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.940
 So important and that is so best.

 For us, that's the best, best, and then do the practice, and then you will be able to

 And then we're going to pray, the supplication prayer for the strap returns of the Chabjib

 Okay, thank you so much, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

 thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:19.120
 not even the names, disease, famine, war, and suffering be heard, but rather may pure conduct,

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.780
 marriage, wealth, and prosperity increase. And may supreme good fortune and well-being

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:31.500
 always arise. The precious bodhicitta and those without it may it be generated, and

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:37.460
 those who have it may it never diminish, but always continue increasing. May the great

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:45.120
 tradition of kenpo-chantarakshita, lopam-vatma-sambhava, and dharma-king, kritsundetsan increase

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:45.380
 and

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:50.480
 spread throughout the three-round world. May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:56.300
 streams of beings remain inseparable and brings sublime well-being throughout the three times.

01:30:56.300 --> 01:31:03.980
 Deity, mantra, and dharma-kaya are the nature of appearance, sound, and awareness. The pervasive

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:09.740
 kaya, the wisdom display of the Buddhas, may practitioners of the profound and secret great

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:16.100
 perfection remain inseparable from the innermost one-taste awareness of wisdom minds.

01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:40.980
 [Music]

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:23.580
 Thank you. Thank you very much for participating. Thank you. May we see you this afternoon. And

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:28.980
 tomorrow morning, we won't have the teachings that is going to offer the empowerment with

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:36.540
 a very subtle empowerment. So I kind of feel always that we are hesitated to do this through

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:44.780
 the internet. So we're going to do that here and won't have the teaching. So that will be.

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:50.580
 Thank you very much, everyone. And then, of course, we will resume everything Monday. Thank you,

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:59.210
 Taki Delhi. And tomorrow, up in the web, meditation, we have time. Thank you, Taki Delhi. Thank you

01:32:59.210 --> 01:32:59.260
