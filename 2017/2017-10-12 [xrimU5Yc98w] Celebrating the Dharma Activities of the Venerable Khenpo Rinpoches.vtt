NOTE     "synopsis": "Celebrating the Dharma Activities of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches and the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center:\nNyingma Tibetan Buddhist Meditation & Study Center\n\nVenerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche (1938-2010) and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche established the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center (PBC) in 1989 to preserve the authentic message of Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava in its entirety, and in particular to teach the traditions of the Nyingma school and Vajrayana Buddhism. PBC includes over 20 centers in the U.S.A., India, Puerto Rico, Latvia, and Russia, as well as monastic institutions in India, the U.S.A., and Russia.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche was born in eastern Tibet and enthroned as a Nyingmapa abbot by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche. He traveled and studied with H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche, as well as with his late brother, Vajrayana master and scholar Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, and his father, the hidden yogi Lama Chimed Namgyal.  As a holder of the complete Nyingmapa lineage, Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche is fully versed in the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana schools, and is a master of Dzogchen. He has co-authored over 25 Dharma books in English with Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, and travels throughout the world giving teachings, empowerments, and personal guidance in fluent English at numerous retreats.\n\nPadma Samye Ling Monastery and Retreat Center is located in Delaware County in upstate New York. Located in the western region of the Catskill mountains, the outstanding facilities are contained within 500 acres of forests, meadows, and natural springs. PSL hosts group and personal retreats throughout the year, as well as an annual philosophical Shedra, weekly Dharma Study, and a long-term residency volunteer program.\n\nFor more information about Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche's activities, the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, to support the new Stupa Garden at PSL, or to schedule coming to PSL for retreat or a visit, please contact:\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nPBC Schedule of Events: www.padmasambhava.org/events/\nPSL Resident Volunteer Program: www.padmasambhava.org/psl-dharma-skills-program/\n\nYouTube: www.padmasambhava.org/youtube\nFacebook: Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\nTwitter: KhenpoRinpoche\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/khenporinpoche\n\nTo learn more about Ven.
