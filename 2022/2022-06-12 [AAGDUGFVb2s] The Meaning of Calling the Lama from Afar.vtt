00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 So you don't have to go to this day. And they say, "Eb, you're so far, even you call. I don't know

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 if they were there or not. I don't know another person's call."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 So what really it means? What Grand Master Digmy Nampa said?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The prayer to the Lama is not calling far. It is devotion. It is devotion.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Guru Nampa is not just a world guru. It is devotion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 So it means we are calling you and me. What are we calling? We are calling to our devotion.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Really, that is the ultimate meaning. We are calling our devotion.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Our devotion is so slim, so skinny. It is not the opposite.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 We've been our devotion diet, diet, strict diet, and so slim, and so skinny.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 It is like garasas, garasas, not like king. So it can, any moment it can break.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 But we are calling that. Calling from where? From the drift of our nature.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 By that nature, we are really going to bring devotion. In Tibet, it is called Mughul.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 In English, it is translated as devotion.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Devotion generally is the path. It is very similar.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 But the path in Buddhism is called Tamatepa, Dopatepa, Yichipatepa.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 That means the path of the clarity, the path of the desire, the path of the confidence.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Three. So this first word, clarity, means clear mind.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 That means, for example, when the water is clear.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Very. It can't be like clean, fertilized, what could. Not fertilized, what could this.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 Ooh, alkaline, alkaline water. So clear and smooth and soothing, calming and gentle to the stomach,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 gentle to the throat and all that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 And the teachings said, I mean that when the teachings like those, alkaline water or purified water

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.000
, those are.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 When the water is clean, there is no muddy. No mud.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 But while our mind is really clear, there is no mud of the emotions, skeptical, hesitation, doubt.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And kind of like what is and the hesitation is.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 You know, all this kind of emotion, thought, habit, fragrance is completely subside.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Our clouded mind comes when you see the Buddha's image or when you see the teachings or when you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 heard like reading the books.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Our mind comes so clear and calm. It just really kind of opens up to.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 That is correctly the emotions. Clear path, calm and deeper a little bit.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 According to the teachings, that is first.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 When that happened, then continuously, if it happened, then you have the desired path.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 That means you like to explore more. That means when you see, for example, water.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.210
 You see the clear, beautiful water, like kind of like sapphire water or emerald water in the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.000
 Caribbean island and all that.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 And now it just is so beautiful. It's so nice and beautiful.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 But now you like to jump. You like to swim. You like to snow grain.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 You like to diamond color. You like to do that. That is desire.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.170
 That's called the desire. So that means you like to engage more on the teaching practice, like that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.000
 desire.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Now that develops strongly. Strongly. That's called then. Like unfailing. Fair.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Or without any change. Completely becomes strong. So that means confidence.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And you got really confident from your practice, meditation or contemplations.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 You got not just the Buddha said and teaching said something.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 But yourself. Now that's not going to move or change.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Unshakeable. That's called in the Caribbean.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Yee-chi-pa-te-pa. Yee-chi-pa-te-pa.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 When you have that yee-chi-pa-te-pa, then this devotion, moo-guh comes.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Moo-guh is what is called.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Devotion is paired with respect, with precious feeling, moo-guh in it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Really that is like un-yurning.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Yurning attitude with respect is the moo-guh strongly.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 So now what you're revealing, when you call in Lama, externally Lama played as a consequence.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Or lineage Lama played as a consequence.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 But cause of that calling Lama, you're revealing your joy, your devotion, your connection, your

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 audience nature.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And it's this cat, this audience nature.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 This is like calling Lama, it's zou-chin, like every uterus.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 It's zou-chin teaching, zou-chin. And zou-chin is not outside.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Zou-chin is our mind, nature of the mind, our rupa, our awareness.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 That is what we are calling.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 That is here his own visual description teacher said absolute Lama.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Absolute Lama, unshakable Lama, unchangeable Lama.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.030
 The Lama that with all that come with you, whether we call, whether we don't call, call with all

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.000
 the prayers, is here.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 That's what we're going to reveal.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 So therefore, this is what really calling Lama power practices.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And that is here, and again here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 So therefore, I mean, generally, there is many calling Lama power by many great masters of all.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And one of the famous one is also by Lama Jambung, Lama Jambung.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Lama Jambung, Lama Jambung.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 That brings the, like, kind of, it just brings heart.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Heart is the power of the heart to calling.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 And that is more lineage Lama prayers.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.270
 It's externally invoking the power and the wishing you achieve those high realization qualities,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.000
 qualities.
