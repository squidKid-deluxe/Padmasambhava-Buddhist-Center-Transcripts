00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 When we do the practices, we have beautiful motivation, such as joy and appreciation and devotions

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080
 and bodhicata.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.260
 And those are the fundamental foundations of the way we practice, when we like to achieve or

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.060
 progress of the dharmon practices.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.760
 Otherwise, the practices become of intellectual and scholarly levels.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.000
 Scholar level practice or kind of understanding, of course, is very special, it has great benefit.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.750
 But full realization or progress of the practices comes with joy, appreciation, devotion and bodhic

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.520
ata.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.040
 We know that those beautiful foundations and beautiful kind of qualities, practicing, is becoming

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.160
 only intellectual,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.740
 is hovering on the brain, is not really settling down to the heart.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.830
 And read the life story of all these great masters, what we call, and how they achieve the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.340
 realization, how they got.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.440
 They are the most renowned scholars in all the time.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.880
 They are mostly intellectuals in all times.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 They are not just believers, believing, believing.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.460
 They are totally examined, investigated, analyzed.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.160
 And they are the most, really, all the time, and great masters, scholars, they can do.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.720
 But when they come to realization, how that realization grows is because joy, appreciation,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.080
 devotion and bodhicata.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.890
 And if you have that, and the knowledge of the teaching, blend it together, that individually is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.480
 like Garuda.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.420
 That individually is like lions.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.860
 They don't have pairs, troubles in the samsara, difficult challenges, whatever comes.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 That troubles and challenges become as reactivating of their realization, their understanding, move

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.040
 forward.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.600
 And read those life stories. So therefore, again, I'm saying, the motivation is so important, so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.240
 please don't miss that.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.320
 And that is joy, appreciation, devotion and bodhicata.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.280
 With this, we practice this Vedic life.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.080
 And we practice this Vedic life to all, every living being, as we say this morning, practices for

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 everyone.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.200
 We practice it. That's what is called bodhicata practice.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.040
 It's not the ego-cling of practice. It is bodhicata practices.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.440
 So therefore, again, it is through those reminding, and now we begin.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.120
 Before that, we are going to do a few minutes of silence of meditation and with beautiful

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.240
 motivation, and then we begin from the very end.
