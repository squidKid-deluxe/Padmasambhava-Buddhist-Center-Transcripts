00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 put by three extra lineages. That means, the first three lineages, what are we just discussing?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.370
 Mind-to-mind transmission lineage, sambolek transmission lineage, and then oral transmission

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.920
 lineage. Those are the three that, sambolek, or three lineages. That you know many times in the

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.000
 teaching, in the historical almost also. So that is.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.820
 Now, with that, there are three additional lineages. Lineages, those are our self intubate, and

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 that's what you will know that, and then I will translate that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 And first is, gabap lungti jay jubap, gabap k-a-b-a-b, gabap k-a-b-a-b, gabap lungti l-u-n-g-t-e-n

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.000
 lungti, gabap lungti jay, g-y-i-n-g.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And g-jubap, then maybe j-u-p-a, or g-y-u-d-p-a. So kabap lungti jay jubap, kabap lungti jay jubap.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 This kabap lungti jubap is, if I translate, kabap is designated. Designated or, yeah, I think it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.000
 designated.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.480
 Designated or elected. Elected or highlighted. Highlighted. And then lungti means profess, profess,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.000
 or prede, prede, predation.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So that means what? Lineage of the designation with the predation.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Lineage of the designation and with the professes. Professors. So that is the first one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:41.530
 Second is munna wankor che jubap, n-o-n-l-a-n, munna wankor w-a-n-g-k-u-r, wankor che, again, same

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.000
 thing, g-y-i, wankor che jubap, jubap, same thing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Other things. So munna means, means aspirations, or prayers, pray that. Munna.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Wankor means integrations. So now jubap is lineage.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:18.610
 So that means lineage of the initiation with the aspirations, or lineage of the empowerment with

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.000
 the prayers.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:42.090
 So that is the second lineage. Third is kandu tejae jubap, kandu, k-h-a-d-r-o, kandu, and tejae, g-

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.000
i, kandu tejae, and jubap.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So that is called kandu, tejae, jubap. Kandu means dakini a little bit.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And tejae means hand with, tejae means hand with cell, s-e-a-f, I think, cell.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So lineage of the dakini handed with cell, cell, cell.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So these are, like very pacifically, thermal lineage.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 So thermal lineage contains the sixth lineage.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Therefore, all thermal teachings are lineage preserved by the sixth lineage.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 The first three are the general, all thermal in my teachings, all the teachings.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Mind-to-mind transmission lineage, and sambore transmission lineage, and oral transmission lineage.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And these third, these last three are pacifically called thermos, thermos.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Now I go over a little bit, over this each minute. So then you will know how thermal is.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Now the fourth is designated with the kavavam in the predictions, that translated, I tell you.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 The kavavam di jubam, kavavam di jubam.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Designated, I think you all know, designated means we are selective sambore, selective.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.750
 So that means in the time of the Gurbia Masambhava. Gurbia Masambhava had so many disciples, 25

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.000
 disciples,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 80 vahasathas of the Yerba regions, and 25 human dakinis, and 35 yandho regions.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 They list all, and plus all, it is not so many individual, like, enlightenment.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Because that time, big of the devotions, big of the joyful effort,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 big of the enthusiasm, big of the determination, courage, and commitment,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 and they are not lingering this and that things.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And they resist, they practice it, and act like this.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.040
 So they have golden era, the realization is bloom, bloom in that time in the Tibetan earth

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.000
 centuries.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.460
 So many. So that means, when they're not taking a focus on doubt, now how many there are those

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.000
 there?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And the chikin said, 108 great things they are subject to.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 108 great datums, and 1,000, another, 1,000, 2, another datum, they'll make that list of that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So there's so many really datums.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 So this old datum has got these three lineages.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Every one. The fourth one is now, again we're talking, designated.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 That means, Gurope Masambhav.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Designated those individually, when that teaching was going to be revealed,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 from the guru of the student, he highlighted, he glorified that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 You are the candidate, you are the authorities. So pick it up.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So he got the really, that individually got the highlight of that, with the blessings.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 How do you like that? That can be, such as Virajyanam, or Nuchisaji, or many other those disciples

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 that you know.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 One of those, within that time, who is the audience?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That time, audience could be 9, could be 7, could be 5, but most of the time in the teaching,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 he said, always there is three, three audience.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Those how many times he said, J. Vang. Toa. Somas.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.490
 J means, it's available, again you write that, because it's a thermal teaching, we're talking about

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.000
 thermal teaching.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 J. Vang. Toa. Somas. J is J. J. S. Jap. J. E. Vang is B-A-N-G.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Toa is D-R-O-G, and some S-U-M's.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Toa, Somas. J. Vang. Toa, Somas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Most of the time, these three are there, always in the teaching set.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Who is J? J means what? J means Lord. L-O-R-D, or J can be king. K-I-M-G king.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And B-A-N-G is subject. Subject. Subject, toa means friend.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And so what that means? Som is three. Three, king and subject and friend.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Three of them, all of them. So king is who? King tozong deeply.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 King tozong deeply, B-A-N-G is Verojana.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Because Verojana was subject of the king tozong deeply.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Even though he became the master of the king tozong deeply,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 but, originally, he was a subject as citizen of the twins.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And he told me the friend. That is E-H-I-C-O-J-A.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 He is a personal friend of G-M-A-S-O-M-O.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 So these three are known as always there is more than time.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Always in the teachings, always there attended there.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 When they designated, when that happened, they always did this.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And so now, so at that time, they selected that individually,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 among all the groups, and G-M-A-S-O-M-O, then prayed it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 That you will become, you will become the techno, and you are going to re-world in the future.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 That area, this time, that indication, that situation,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and that time, you will be going to re-world that teachings.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 So that is when that ceremony or that acknowledging will happen.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 That is known as the Ka-Bop-U-M-T-J Jupa, that Jupa, so predicted.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 So that is the first one.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 When that happened, when that is selected and predicted,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 not just happened, then lived there, but then the second they applied.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 That is Munna-U-M-Kurdya Jupa.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Munna-U-M-Kurdya Jupa, translated as, I think, so prayers and empowerment,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 lineage of the prayers and empowerment, or lineage of the aspirations and empowerment.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 So now, G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A, whatever that teaching, God is going to re-world,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A gives empowerment.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Again, even though they already received, highly received that empowerment,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 if they practice in meditation, they become highly enlightened beings.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Such as 25 disciples, but here again, G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A, specifically, empowerment, teaching.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Teaching on that, with aspiration, G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 That means bringing, making every best wishes to fulfill this goal, this aim,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 without any obstacles, without any handling, and be benefited to the beings.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 As G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A, they attended, with all the audience,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 at least three audience, or more audience.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Audience, that G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A gave that person that came to G-M-S-O-M-A-S-O-M-A,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 together with G-M-S-O-M-A, and gave that empowerment, gave that teaching,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 gave that, all the instructions, instructions, how to re-world, how to do that,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 and, in a way, it really transmitted that teaching, that leading power,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 in their Muslim mind, streams, streams, with G-M-S-O-M-A,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 by G-M-S-O-M-A.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So, that is known as Munna-Wankar-Jajab.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Once that all done, then that teaching is handed over

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 over to the Dakini and the Dhannapalas, Proteccas.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Proteccas, wherever that inpatient can be, can be,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 and this Dhannapalas also that means they attended there in it,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 and that ceremony, that ceremony, they attended there, they attended.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And they handed by European Muslim women, with G-M-S-O-M-A,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 and key these teachings, until this designated, empowered individual comes

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 and keep that teaching, with sales, sales, sales, S-E-A-F,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 that never lost it, never gone, never busted, never, according to lost it,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 until this goal is achieved, achieved.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So then, that both Dhannapalas and Dakini's are also really committed,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 promise that I will preserve, I will keep, I will protect this city,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 until that designated individual comes.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So, that is known as, that is what now, there is in that teaching,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 that all happen, that all power, that all blessings,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 that all aspirations are empowered, that is all is in the mind-streams

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 of those great enlightened beings.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 For example, that individually designated, that one is like,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 as, as Nuki Sadi Ishii, so Nuki Sadi Ishii got all that lineage, right there.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 So now, when they revere that teaching, and for example,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 when they were born as Nuki Sadi Ishii was reincarnated so many times,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 great death was one after another, and one of the, also leading example

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 of the incarnation of the Nuki Sadi Ishii was Satsang Nampa.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 When Satsang Nampa revere that teaching, and he already have that lineage,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 pre-linearity teaching, in his Muslim mind-streams.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 But at the same time, that time, when he revere that teaching,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 when he began to transcribe this teaching, that, during that processes,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 also he received that entire once again that, that empowerment or that lineage.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Lineage of the Kavalundi, lineage of the Mona Wankon,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 and lineage of that Kanukdeja, all that, re-activated that lineage.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Therefore, these teachings, Dhamma teachings are known as the so authentic,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 so special, not deluded, not spoiled, the full of blessings

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 and even in teaching, often he said, the breathing of the Dakini's are never evaporated.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It's warmth, the breath of Dakini's are contained.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 So that means, although this Dhamma palace in the Dakini kept that teaching

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 so dearly to their heart, as their heart, and protect it, teachings,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 until that designated theta could come.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So that means, even other theta was similar, they have similar realization,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 similar understand, they are not going to handle that,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and always kept that until that teaches.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So that is really about the, about the, generally not their teachings.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So that, you know, I think understand.
