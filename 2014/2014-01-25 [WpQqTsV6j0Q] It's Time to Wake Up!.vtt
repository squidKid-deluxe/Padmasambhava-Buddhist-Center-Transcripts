NOTE     "synopsis": "On January 21, 2014 in West Palm Beach during the 2014 Annual Dzogchen Winter Retreat, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche emphasized the importance of waking up by activating the Two Motivations of (1) sincerely generating vast bodhichitta to free all beings from suffering, and (2) seeing all experiences are being pure by nature according to the enlightened view of Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\n\"When we're practicing Vajrayana, we should not hang out in the garbage piles of habitual patterns - staying there and trying to practice \"Dzogchen.\" It won't become Dzogchen. We have to wake up. We've been sleeping for a long time in the garbage mountain of our habitual patterns. It's time to wake ourselves up. Wake up the bright sunshine of the reality true nature of the way things are. ... Making ourselves small and itsy bitsy, and staying in the dark corner and hiding. That is duality. That is not the bravery practice of the Vajrayana. That is very timid practice - hiding in the corner, covering ourselves up with duality. We've been doing that since beginningless time, again and again. \"",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Thank you, thank you. Again, we continue to follow the teaching of the great master,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.510
 the historian of the Union, and as well as also the important hero in their life, in their

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.200
 blessings,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 as well as the lineage of the masters of Vadada Mahasananda, following in their footsteps according

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 to our best confidence.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Again, this is one of the very beautiful moments in special time for us. And for all of us,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 we should always bring up yoga with your worship. At the same time, always in the teaching,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.210
 and as well as the public and people in the terrible music, we bring up the beautiful two

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 motivations,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 an accurate and truthful motivation. As I said the other day, also come home.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.630
 This is the same thing, come home. It is something that we should raise up, raise up, not let hell

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.000
 down,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 in a ditch of hell, how to sleep, stay, wake up our soul, wake up to stays,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 wake up our mind, in the vastness, motivation of the bodhicama.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Today we are gathering here, and we are practicing bhana. It is not just for our only purposes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 We are doing this for all the same things. Open our heart, open our mind,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 and we do the practice, as the great master says. And we really wish that sincerely from our heart.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.070
 That is known as the motivation of the vastness of the bodhicata. Bodhicata, thinking of everyday

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 needs.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And together with that, since we are followers of the Vedayana practitioners,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 we add the second motivation, as K.T. Bannithiramudu always says,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 the Vedayana motivation, bring up the realization of the beauty and understanding of everything.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 That is important. When we practice the Vedayana thinking,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 when we are practicing on the doki practices,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 we should not hang out in the kind of rest in the garbages of the pious of the habit patterns,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 and stay within there and practice doki. It won't become doki practicing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We have to have a wake up. A wake up is about the time for us to know.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.520
 We have been living a long time sleeping in the garbage mountain of the habit patterns for a long

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.000
 time.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 A long time we will be sleeping. It is a time to wake up ourselves.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Wake up the bright sunshine of the reality of the true nature of Vedas.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 This is what God said in the Vedayana teaching, three Vedya states.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Vedya on the phone, Vedya on the speech, and Vedya on the borders.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I will expand a little bit there, and then always the Vedayana teaching says the five perfects.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Perfect. Perfectly teaching, perfect direction or assembly,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 perfect teaching, perfect process, perfect time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 That is true. It is not something talking with the kind of stories or making of things.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 The reality level, that is what it is. And we want to practice doki.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And we really engage in doki. Doki is not a conceptual state.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Doki is not a habit pattern. Doki is not an immortal state.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Doki is not a skeptical state. Doki is a clarity.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Believe the sun, the sun, the free from all the habit patterns.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Free from all the habit patterns and conceptions.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 That transcendence and everything, the all inner nature as it is.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Within that state, embracing that nature with the current imitment, confidence and bodhicata,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 then truly we are great practitioners of doki.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Truly brave practitioners of Vedayana.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 And truly Vedaya and as well as Mahayana practitioners.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Truly there. As it is.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 We are making ourselves small and itsy-bitty and staying in dark corners and hiding this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 That is duality. This is not a brave practice of Vedayana.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 That's a very timid practice. Kind of hiding in the corner in duality,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 cover up with duality in hiding and making of things, things in the blood.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 As we've been doing that since beginner times, as Buddha said,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 we've been doing that. We've been sporting to the ego claim for the beginner times,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 again and again, making things up, prying out all these things, one after another.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And then we become thicker, heavier, heavier, heavier.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And then habit pattern is so heavy and dense, and become almost ice.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And we struck ourselves in cocoon as cocooned.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That's what happened. Therefore it is wake up ourselves in this two motivation status.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 That's how we began the practice.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 If we started with that motivation, if we maintained that motivation,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 if we concluded our practice in everything with that motivation,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 surely we are the Vedayana practitioners.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Really our practice is going so good, so perfect, so perfectly.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Something so beautiful, special for ourself, something beautiful, special for all the living beings

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.000
.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Truly we're following the footsteps of the Buddha, Shakyamuni,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Gharapayam Maasambhava, and all the great masters,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 such as Ayr Vidyadhara, the Newman schools,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Gharabdhoji, Yaparachini, Hilyasana, as well as Jnanasukara,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I mean all those who can think Gharapra, and Jnanasanti, Rambam, so forth.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 All those great masters, Rilifar, and the 25 disciples who are Gharapayam Maasambhava,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 and as well as all those masters of the Kama and the Tenma Lineages.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 So that is what, and this is again, we're doing, I'm doing this reminding to you,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 we all, I'm reminding to myself, I'm reminding to yourself.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 This is our responsibilities.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 As always in the teachings, Sangha means the spiritual community,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 helping to support each other, and moving along the path of the, then, the teaching,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 and aspiring, supporting that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 So in that context, I'm a being, since I have kind of stand right in front of you,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 as a player, all of them are kind of reminded to you,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 so I'm just completely reminded that to you all, and as well as myself.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 With that context, then we follow all these little teachings.
