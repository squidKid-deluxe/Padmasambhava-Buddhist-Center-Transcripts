00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 Also, there are different practices. Kind of going through the outskirts, outskirt, and come to the

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.000
 center,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 or from the center to explore, explore all the surrounding everything.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.030
 And for example, like Sotar Mahayana teachings, in a way, exploring from the outskirts, coming back

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.000
 to the center.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And the Dzogi teaching, or the Ena Tantra teaching, from the center, you behold everything.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 And that's what the great master, Dung Kimba, said.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Naini Yana is the pick of the nine, pick of them, pick of the teaching.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 But as teaching, from there, you see everything, everything you behold, everything you begin as.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 So here, we begin to go to the center, and from there, we explore.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 And in order to do again, to do this, there is that, in order to do this, that's what called

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 introducing, introducing, or pointing out.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.890
 We heard those words many times, very nice and fancy, fancy, beautiful, it's true, it's fancy and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 beautiful.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 This time, we are going step by step, pointing out, or introducing, introducing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 What is introducing?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 It's not the great master pointing out the fingers.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And the great master, Shabbat Tawurana, is pointing to our nature, nature of the mind, to our self.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So that means, each time we did these lines, we go through this, we are going to point to our self,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 instead focus outward.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.390
 We are going to inwardly discover our intelligence, use our intelligence, and discover our innate n

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.000
atures.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.300
 And for this time, what is explaining, these great masters, that everything is mind, or all the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.000
 perception is mind.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Every perception is mind, or every appearance, whatever the word is, appearance is mind.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 That is introducing.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Of course, since we are practicing dharma for a while, we heard these things, that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.370
 But, if we didn't hear these things, it is introducing, immediately, this is the first voice that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.000
 we can hear.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Oh, everything, all the preparedness is mind.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Mind, every appearance, every perception is mind.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And again, to do this, we are going to practice this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 When you come to the practice, what is this most important?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It is certainty.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Certainty was taught.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Certainty means no doubt, no hesitations, no skeptical, no lingering thoughts.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 When you have the certainty, that means you are sure, you are open, and you are very relaxed.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 You are confident.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Therefore, when we practice, we need confidence.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 We need certain diversity.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Together with that, we need courage and commitment.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.250
 Courage and commitment need, because we are, as I said, we are changing the course of the happy

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.000
 dependence.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 That carried and used to be so many lifetimes, until now, from the beginning of this lifetime.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Today we are changing the course of that happy dependence.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Therefore, it is not always easy, not always simple, as what we call a piece of cake.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It is not a piece of cake.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Truly, it is not a piece of cake.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And therefore, we need courage and commitment.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Once you have certainty, confidence, we don't have to linger.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 We strengthen our courage and commitment, reactivate courage and commitment.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Bring forth this realization, this understanding from the deep of our heart.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And let shine that to all our perceptions, all our conceptions.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 That's how we change perception and conceptions.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And then, when they transform, what is called three-way jeal states, five perfect states, all this.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So therefore, this Master is explaining again and again, again and again, sense is so important.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 It started from there, it's so important.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And therefore, it's one pointing out, this teaching.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So here, again and again.
