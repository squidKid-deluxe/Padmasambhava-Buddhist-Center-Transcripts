00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640
 Nondro practices. And then, second, is Pacifica Nondro practices. There is two. Janaru Nondro

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:19.700
 practices is, is, is what, and here H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche teaches here, says that Janaru Nondro

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 practices is reflecting strongly on the four renowned session thoughts.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.960
 In order to begin, again, I'm, in teaching, already practiced here, that please in, and what's

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.000
 called, infallible, perfecto, perfecto, lama, root teacher.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.020
 H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche teaches here. He's honored, Nondro, in the form of the Gharb M. Asambo. Please

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.830
 watch me. Consider me. Bless me. So the Mayor, I completely fulfill another meaning of this four

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.000
 renowned session.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.220
 It's kind of strongly really filled connection. And the four renowned session, again, I just

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:13.250
 summarized that is, is any practices. Both is, precious life, or precious human body, is, first,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.000
 second is impermanence.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.030
 Third is, is, cause and effect are inevitable, or reflecting the karma, commonly known as the karma

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.000
 action. And the fourth is, samsara has a difficulty.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.910
 These four are so important, and that's what the greatest teacher, Buddha, gave the fourth is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.000
 teaching, known as poor, noble truth. What is poor, noble truth?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.010
 Noble truths are suffering truth, cause of suffering truth. And then, part truth, sensation truth.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.000
 Or, sensation truth, part truth.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.960
 So that poor, among that poor, this poor renunciation is the first truth, suffering truth, cause of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.000
 suffering truth.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.090
 That's the essence, condensate meaning of the first truth. And now, in that way, the fourth is the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.000
 precious body, precious life.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.190
 These precious, why is called precious? Because to, according to the teaching of the Buddha, to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.000
 obtain a human body, or to be as human beings, is not so easy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.590
 Because it has very, very selected, the perceived cause and conditions, really have to be. And

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.000
 without the cause and conditions, we won't get anything.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.180
 So it has to be born as human beings, is really special cause and condition, which is known as

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.000
 karma, commonly.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.280
 So that means, what we have, our body and our present situation is resolved. So that means, in the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.000
 past, we did good karma.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.720
 In the previous lifetime, that's why we are really beautiful human beings. Now, precious. And what

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 we have now, precious human beings, is eating endowments.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:36.330
 At freedom, ten luxuries. It's so precious, so special. So therefore, feel happy, feel joy, how

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.000
 precious it is.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.440
 That what in some, many times the teaching, that is so special, so rare. Difficult to obtain this,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.000
 yet we got. We got this beautiful precious life.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.010
 It's like we're fully in it. We're not taking always making the wish-fulfilling games. It's more

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.000
 rare, more precious than wish-fulfilling jewels.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It's so special. So how grateful, how so special, thankful, happy.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.600
 With joy and happy, and now have the commitment that I'm going to use this for the good purpose,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.000
 for the goal, really have some connections or some review of the commitment in heart and mind.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.680
 Because why we need? Because this is also not going to last forever. It's a short time. Our life is

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.000
, in a way, really short moment.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.130
 It's just a short time we're here and having this beautiful time in the situation. It's not going

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.000
 to last.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.280
 So where everything is in our hands, where everything is under our control, why we don't take the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.000
 advantage of this situation?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.360
 And we don't take the advantage of this. Then it's time the precious life is not going to wait for

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.000
 us.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.490
 Therefore, really take the full time of advantage and use this point, something that we make

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.000
 ourselves strong, happy mentally.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Feel happy so that we don't have to feel how to bend or this appointment at the end.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.600
 And always in the teachings said, you should be always, when you look back, look back, when you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.000
 look back, make yourself happy.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Do you think that you feel happy? Or when I look back myself, I did good.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Now I'm doing good, I will do good, have commitment.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 So looking fast, you did good, now you're doing good, and the future of our plan is to be good.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.160
 And we have that attitude. And in the teachings said, then you're fulfilling your life, purpose of

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.000
 this life.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Therefore, this is a present and momentary, and well, everything is our opportunity we should use.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And why? Why is it kind of not going to stick? Because the second is the employment.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 This second employment is also, I mean, is continually changing that we all know.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.630
 Really, how many things change since we have the memory, until now, if you look back, how many

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.000
 things change?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 The 80, companions, experience, our wealth, our treasure, and that all change.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Whether we like is change, whether we don't like is change. Everything is really change.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Change is changing now, and wealth change. Nothing is permanent. That is what in the teachings said

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.000
.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 The growth level in permanent and the subtle level in permanent.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 The growth level in permanent, what in the teachings said.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 The external universe is in permanent. The world is in permanent.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Inhabited in the beings who live in, is in permanent.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And every reflected, all those enlightened beings, noble beings, is in permanent.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Such as the great British teacher Buddha.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.010
 And all those great Ahadas, is only historians. This great teacher Buddha and Ahadas, all those Mah

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.000
asadas,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 they have the power to change the elements.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.500
 They can walk through the walls, sitting on the sky, transforming water into the fire, fire into

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.000
 the water.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And going down under the ground, as like a transparent, walking through the wall.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And in the teachings said, murking, the, murking the, from the book of cows, murking.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 You can murk in the Book of Quorum of Cows. It's unbelievable.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.590
 And one, I mean, in Christianity too, I just, of course, I'm sure there's so many, but I, one of

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.000
 that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Yeshua Christ starts poem, one bread, so many breads to spread so many things.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And one alcohol starts poem, so countless alcohols, all these things.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 They change these things, they can't do.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Wow, yet, it's only really the historians. It's all, it's not our science now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And Gautam Rama Sambaba is according to teaching, beyond the death and birth.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 But also, it's only in the teaching. It's left from Tibet, fluent from sky to the sky.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.920
 I mean, there, it's really late. And then all the universe, those kings, powerful kings, monarch,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.000
 and all,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 so powerful, so dignity, so glorious, and rich in power, also, have been always gone.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.640
 So therefore, we said, think of the impermanence, the mind impermanent to the universe, and the

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.000
 world is how many things change.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 And according to Buddhism, this world is not going to last forever.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It's only going to last 20 years in the teachings.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 It came nearly 20 years before it came. It was going to decline.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And then you're going to become completely spiritual.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 He said according to teaching, so it's nothing going to last.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And then, in all the experiences, one thing we had, so therefore what in the teaching said,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 reflected impermanence to the universe, reflected impermanence to the inhabitants,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 reflected impermanence to the noble beings, reflected impermanence to those powerful beings,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 and reflected impermanence, reflected impermanence to all the beings of six realms,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 and reflected impermanence to each of our own experiences.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And when we reflected that impermanent, according to teaching,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 teaching all the great masters and Buddhists, it made our heart more soft, more tender,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 we become more practical, and used time for beautiful purposes, really, with that.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And also we get glimpse, understand where really things are.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Now we're just looking through the kind of sky or completely other directions.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 We ignore it around us.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Reflecting impermanence is great knowledge.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 For that reason, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said that

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 among all the conceptions, that thought of the impermanent is great, is big and super.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 It's a conception, but it is true conception, true thought.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Then suddenly impermanence, we don't detect.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Ourself we don't detect. We are gross level.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Everything is moving and changing.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 All those malakus, essence, that means the essence is changing.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 There's no impermanent, permanent essence. It's changing.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 That subtle impermanent is pushing the gross impermanent, we can only detect it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Reality is shifting, shifting, changing, and affirming.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 So that is so, according to teaching, is so important to reflect that, that impermanent.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 The next one is cause and conditions.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 The karma is so important.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 This time we're going to reflect everything is cause and condition.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 External is cause and condition, effort, and inwardly is cause and condition, effort, everything.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Nothing really has came without cause and condition and cooperation.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 But this time we are not taking emphasize inner cause and condition, our own inner states.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 That means what? Our mind.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Mind, that is we really have to observe our mind.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Because mind is the producer of our karma.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 No one, according Buddhism, no one else is producing the karma and overloading to us.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Once all karma is produced by one's own mind, there's no one else.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And who controls our own mind?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 According Buddhism, no one is controlling our mind except you, except one's own sight.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Therefore, we have 100% right capabilities and authority to keep the balance and control our own

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 mind.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And so what we have to do?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Where is the time?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Time, our mind is wired, carried by force of dualities, emotions.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Emotions.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 So therefore we have to control our self.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And then what is this?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Karma is produced by the mind.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Positive mind and its action produce the good karma.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Negative mind and negative action, action of that, produce the negative karma.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.060
 So negative or bad karma and good karma is produced by one's own positive mind or good mind and bad

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.000
 mind.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 That's why we really have to watch.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And what is bad karma?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And again, great master.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Nagarjuna said in his teachings,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 the anger, ignorance, attachment is negative.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And any action came from that combination, it will be negative action and negative karma.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Negative karma.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 And what is positive?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.990
 The non-attachment, no anger means loving kindness, or detachment and loving kindness and

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.000
 compassion.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And the wisdom is positive.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.900
 And whatever action comes from that, through the body, through the verbal, that is positive or good

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.000
 karma.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 So that is karma we create.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So this karma, the dual of the karma is our own mind.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Then when we create the karma, what does that mean? Of course, we all know that.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 But karma means it is, now we've reproduced the cause.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 We really created a good cause.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Where we registered, where we're keeping that?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.710
 What is Buddhism? We're keeping that each time automatically, naturally, on the self-consciousness

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.000
 throw house.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Our own self-consciousness throw house.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 We kept the cause.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Now we're piling up the seat, whether it's good or bad, we're printed in self-consciousness.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Self-consciousness throw house may be more than time.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 We can use examples as eye-clothes, or the big space eye-clothes of the consciousness.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 We kept that. Now, really, we registered.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Once you registered there, when you keep there, it's not going to go away.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Unless, again, you did something, our own self did something to make that go away.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Otherwise, it will stay there for as long as until it's matured or fertilized and grown.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 When it's caused there, what is now? Conditional place.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 That is against minds and combinational activities, and our deed, and then it matures.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 It comes, boom, one after another.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And when it comes, also it's not just one negative, get one resolve, or one karma get one resolve.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 It multiplies.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Similar, when we planted apple seed, apple tree, apple seed, I believe it's apple seed.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 One apple seed, small apple seed grows one apple tree.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 That from one seed, with conditions, mind took it.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And each apple tree, that one seed, apple tree, that one seed that comes apple tree,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 and then how many apples comes from that?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Hundreds of apples comes every year. It's continuous.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Multiply. When that will stop, until you destroy it, or until something big condition comes,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 and destroy that apple tree, then it stops.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 So same thing. Karma won't go. It multiplies.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It will gain reaction again and again, and we don't do that.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.860
 Therefore, actions that we have to pay, really, very powerful with that mind from the student

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.000
 actions.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 So that's really important. And therefore, the positive, negatives are all in our mind's produce.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.580
 And there is, again, positive, generally, and then all the negatives, I mean, this is called, what

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.000
's called?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Negative has many different categories.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Those are, when it's highlighted, those are different groups.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 I mean, things, even though it causes anger, causes negative, causes anger, and attachment anger,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 but when it comes, then it came through what?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 What's called ten known virtues. Ten known virtues.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Three by the body, four by the speech, three by the mind.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Those four, I mean, ten known virtues.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 That is come from the causes symbol.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Three, anger, attachment, and ignorance.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Come back and develop ten different.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And then each of those, again, develop so many really big karmas.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And those are, generally, these ten known virtues. It's, what's called, natural karma.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Natural karma means it's just universally proved.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Everybody, whether you're a Buddhist, whether you're not Buddhist today, whether you're a believer

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 in there,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 whether you're not believer, everybody thinks ten known virtues is not good, bad.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 That's it. Therefore, called rambi-kana-mato, means it's naturally proved.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.500
 And then jeba-kana-mato, but above that, vast upon that, then jeba-kana-mato is restricted

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.000
 negativity.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Those are kind of such as breaking the walls, rules, and regulations.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Generally, the Buddhism, Buddha teaching is really vast on good human conduct, ethics.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So then, the ten known virtues is when his Buddha teaching vast on that and expanded,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 and then those, all the vows came in Buddhism.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Vinaya vows and Bodhic vowels, and then as well as Vaidyana, Samaya, all the vows, all that came.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 It's from this ten known virtues, expanded that.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And then ten good virtues, ten good, positive virtues, opposite of that.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 And that is when you keep that, when you keep those perfectly and according to that nature,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 when you award that, naturally we are keeping up all the vows and all the Samayas,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 all the rules, the guidelines of the Buddha's teaching.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So, Buddha's teaching is really vast on very practical, very practical, very systematic,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 and very natural, is vast on the good conduct of human beings.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 For that reason, the great master Nagarjuna said,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 "If you have good ethics in the conduct of the human work, human beings,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 then you are not far from heaven."

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 When you are in heaven, the realization that one is not far, that's why.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 So, it's all really vast down there.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 So, therefore, cause, and then, of course, you can read.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 There are so many beautiful books, more details of that,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 but that's my brilliant talk about the cause and the condition.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Effects are inevitable.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 I mean, this is inevitable.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Once you print it, unless we qualify it.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And then, next one is, the fourth one is, Samsara has challenged the difficulties.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Samsara is the result of the cause of suffering truth, according to the teacher.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 That means, Samsara is the result of the anger, and ignorance, and attachment,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 and then, combination of those, the emotions, the jealous, and arrogance, and all that.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 So, Samsara is really the result of the cause of suffering truth.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Samsara is, according to the teaching, suffering truth, in that category,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 and among the two past truths, Samsara is.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 So, therefore, it has troubles, it has challenges, difficulties.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And there is, how many Samsara, what are Samsara?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 According to Buddhism, there are six realms.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Hell ram, hungry ghost, animal, and those are known as three law rams.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:54.350
 They have more challenges, more difficulties, more troubles in the life, really, according to the

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.000
 teaching.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.290
 And three upper rams of Samsara, which is considered higher, and better, and more, kind of, lever

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.000
aged.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Those are the human rams, astral rams, and God's rams.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Those are the three upper rams.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.900
 Even though these upper rams are really better than three law rams, but yet, we have so many

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.000
 troubles.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And human rams, I mean, it is all shared in one upper.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And all the Buddhism, those are being shared.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Even though we all have to get good, we don't have to go through these changes, challenges.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 And then, getting old, sickness, death, all those are challenges.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 And then for us, there are so many challenges.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 And astral rams, there are so many other challenges.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Particularly, a cold activity, fighting, and arguing, even though it is a better condition

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 than even human rams, but yet, there are so many challenges.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 And God's rams had also a lot of troubles, even though they are good times.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Good times are everything, but it is not going to last forever.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And in the end, they have great trouble.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 So, therefore, Samsara is just moments of trouble.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And so, for those reasons, the end, we really going to change the direction.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 If we keep confusingly, as we have been doing, then there is just an endless Samsara.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 There is nothing going to change.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 For that reason, then I am going to change the direction.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And then follow the next practice.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And then follow the practice.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And you see, I told you, the thinking of the full number two, then part two.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Follow with the five.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And part two is about bringing the end, the result as a sensational truth.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And sensation means what's ceased.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 And it's stopping.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Now all the difficulty is troubled.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And the cause of suffering and bad things.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Completely, inwardly stopped.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 That is the sensation, breathing.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 So, that is really about this whole renunciation of thought.
