00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.370
 But our own mind, our this mind, also Buddha teaching mentioned the emptiness mind. It's true, it's

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 the emptiness. I don't know if we can find anything substantially solid existing at all.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 It doesn't matter how much you're expert, how much you're investigating, analyzing, there's nothing

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.000
 to be found.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 Since, from the beginning of the 2600 years ago, until now, there's so many great intellectuals,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.000
 scholars, experts, ever as great as they analyze it, light it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.860
 There's so many ways they're trying to find out, no body of form at all. So it's the emptiness mind

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.000
. But yeah, the emptiness mind is the source of every creation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.670
 Everything is created by this emptiness mind. Mind is behind the scene, behind the scene of the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 physical, behind the scene of the verbal communications that we know.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 Yet, even though it's nothing to be found, yet it is really doing everything. And from the mind,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 the reflection of this negative emotions, and this becomes the cause of suffering.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.870
 And then, with all that, sufferings are coming, that which is known as karma. So now, when you're

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:34.760
 talking about karma, again, I mentioned yesterday, and now you know, it's not so they are talking

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 that you never heard them talking that, but it is karma.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.680
 Karma, so karma is made by the mind. Mind and the negative mind create the negative karma, and the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.000
 positive mind creates the positive karma.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.370
 And who is going to experience? This is one's own, our sub-one's own. Creators are going to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.000
 experience the karma.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 That, loudly, clearly, doesn't matter how much time it takes, how many lifetimes it takes, but one

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.990
 time, once and surely, it will be came so clearly, so vibrating with, and will pronounce that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.000
 exactly.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.340
 Even though, maybe, you don't know what the cause is, but it is according to the religious

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 teachings, Buddhism is caused by our own negative emotions.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 So now, yesterday, we went, I mean, the idea of the negativity, there is two negatives. One is

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 natural negatives.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.540
 And that means, I think, universally, societally, through negativity, and those are ten non-virtues

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.000
.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And I listed those, and I went a little bit over each details of each point yesterday.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And that's natural. It doesn't matter whatever society you live, whatever tradition you are,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 whatever language you speak, those ten non-virtues are,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 everybody thinks this is not right, that is not right. That's what we call natural negatives.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.410
 Then, there is another negativity. Negativity is every conduit. If we did those, then you become

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.000
 negative. Otherwise, it's not negatives.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And those are, I translated, for the day, forbidden un-virtues, all restricted un-virtues.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.050
 So that means, it's restricted, but if we maintain on that system, restricted as a line, then that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.000
 is not negatives.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 But if we all pass that, if we didn't follow that rule, then it becomes negatives. Why?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Because also, we are, what's called, we are made commitment. We promise that we will keep that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So you are against our own vote. We are against our own promise, our commitment, what we said.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And so that is known as, then, the public, what's called the forbidden or restricted non-virtues.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Now, restricted non-virtues is generally what is the teachings of the Buddha.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Every kind of use, general terminology of this restricted un-virtues is morality. It is morality.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Why? Because I made those guidelines, those rules, because to protect us from all habit patterns.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.310
 Therefore, these rules are not, kind of, like, possible. These rules are not just, kind of, ban

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.000
ishing.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.970
 These rules are not suppressing, pushing down us, but these rules make us more light, more simple,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.000
 more peaceful.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 These rules, we can understand how important to respect each other and everyone.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 How we should be safe in harmony and peaceful. We stay, how we stay should be safe.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.200
 So therefore, these rules are nothing but how to simplify our life with calm, peaceful, respect and

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.000
 appreciation to every living being.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.860
 These rules and great collections are also known as, it's like, environmental friend. How respect

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.000
 to everyone.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 That's what it is, all that. So therefore, it is so special, so beautiful.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.170
 Once you follow that, it's nothing really anything, kind of, strangely ruled out, but nothing but

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.000
 how to be mindfulness,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 how to be kind and competitive, to preserve that attitude and act that way and maintain that way.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 That's why the teaching is all that these rules are. And so when you're talking about the rule,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.180
 therefore, I talk about all that, the restricted or guidelines, what the Greek teacher Buddha

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.000
 taught.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.900
 It has two guidelines. Those are known as, supposedly, short-time guidelines and long-term

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.000
 guidelines.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Short-time guidelines are particularly designed for the lay practitioners.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And of course, ordinary ones can do the lay practitioners.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 They also like to keep the guidelines or like to keep for short time, such as 24 hours.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.120
 And those are in the teaching said, what? Opascals. Opascals? Or it is also known, not sorry, I'm

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.000
 making a different story,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 but that is known as yin-ning, yin-ning, short-time. Short-time, 24 hours.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 What do you keep for 24 hours? It is that first four principle negativities.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And those are killing, stealing, sexual conduct and lying. Those are four. Above that, toxicating,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 any toxications.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Those are known as fire. Above that, not singing, not dancing, not putting the performs,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 as well as not only ourself, all targeted at ourselves.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 That is, those people individually, lay practitioners, like to keep that for 24 hours.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 That is what they are really known as. At precise.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Again, not killing, not stealing, not sexual conduct, and not lying.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 That is a poor principle. Above that, not toxicating.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And toxicating is what it's called. It's called, again, trying to steal more alertness.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Every toxicating we could lose or we will lose our mind from us.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 So those are the five. Above that, known as not singing, not dancing, not performing.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And plus, and not putting ointments, not making makeup, not making ointment or performs,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and not only the ointments. Those are all targeted, at precise.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And then, with that, there is another ointment. Those are known as uni practice.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Many of you know, that's a very popular practice on the Tibetan Buddhism, uni practices.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 That is also similar, but uni practices is a little more than 24 hours.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It is two days, 24 hours, two times.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And that is also above that, at precise, not drinking, not eating, and not talking.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.500
 When you are not eating, not drinking, not talking, or when you do that, when you take that

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.000
 perception, what do you do?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Then, just completely, kind of completely engage it, and part, and spend time on the practice.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.330
 Meditating, reciting the mandana, and all cultivating with both each other, that's the really what

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.000
 they do.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 So that is the word, the new, short-time precise.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Now, second is long-term precise. Long-term precise is then can be divided into every set.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 According to Vayayana teaching, divided into three.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:00.770
 And the parti mukcha vows, bodhisattva vows, and Vayayana vows. So there is three vows, all three

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.000
 different commitments.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:12.540
 First is the parti mukcha vows, which is foundation vows, vows or the guidelines of the foundations

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.000
.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.560
 Now, what does that mean? Guide by the foundation of the bodhisattva vows, the foundation of the V

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.000
ayayana vows.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 What is that? That is the parti mukcha vow, or many times, commonly named as the vinayas.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Vinaya vow is the foundation of the bodhisattva vows and Vayayana vows.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So that is really what the foundation is.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Vinaya vow, which is also known as parti mukcha vows.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Mukcha vows, all the vinaya vows, basic good vows or the guidelines of the basic bodhisattvas.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.140
 This is the difference between that guideline have been observed by the Mahayana practitioners of

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.000
 bodhisattvas and as well as Vayayana practitioners.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Of course, of course, like with all the shagaka and the parti Buddha.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Yana, also they have to observe that, observe that practices.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 So now we talk about the fourth, really about this first vow, post vows.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 First vow is the parti mukcha vow or the vinaya vows.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Vinaya vow can be divided into two groups.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Laya practitioner vows and the ordinary practitioner vows.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 That is the two major divisions.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Laya practitioner vows, that is, laya practitioners like to keep.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.880
 They like to be laya or as a regular person, but at the same time they like to observe, they like

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.000
 to preserve some little vows.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 So they can maintain more simple, more peaceful, more harmonized and maintain.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 What are those?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 In offering in the teaching said, for example, there are five principles of vows.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Five principles of vows are, again, not killing, not stealing, not lying, not sexual misconduct.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Those are the four groups.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Above that, not prosecuting.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Those are the five principles of vows of the laya practitioners.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Whether they are men or whether they are women.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And then there is the ordinary.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 I am talking freely.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And then there are ordinary practitioners.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Then there is novasmong, male and female.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So that means novasmong, novasnams.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 And then fully-oriented mongs, fully-oriented nams.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Then in the beat, when the fully-oriented nams, there is the old guelugmas, some other things.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 But anyway, those are all known as ordinary mongs.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Again, if I talk freely about the vows of these Norse mongs, how many do they have vows?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 The principle is ten vows, ten principles of vows.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 And if we extend that mong, it is called thirty-three different vows, vows.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 So novasmong have the thirty-three.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 I would summarize that into the ten groups.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And those are very similar with that 24-hour vow, short-term vow.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 That is very similar.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.170
 And what is the extra is, and not eating the food in the afternoon, at the same time not taking the

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.000
 precious jewels or the precious materials

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 and not sitting the higher thrombs or higher bed or the expensive bed or expensive thrombs.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Those are the novasmong.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 And then how many vows?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 The mongs have two hundred and fifty-three vows, two hundred and fifty-three vows.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 That is the mongs.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And the non-fully-ordered nams even have more.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 And the teaching said three hundred and sixty-three, three hundred and sixty-three vows.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:50.200
 Why? Ladies have more vows because in the teaching said ladies are more vulnerable in obstacles in

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.000
 the world, in the outer world.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Therefore to protect and to protect in the upkeep in their morality and their control.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So therefore those extra guidelines, whole hundred extra guidelines, those are the making.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.410
 Because it's all again, as I said, preservation and their vows at the same time not disturbing to

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.000
 anyone.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Calm and peaceful, respect and appreciation.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 That is the work of vows, of the Vinaya vows.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Now that Vinaya vow is foundation, as I said already, is foundation vows.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 And above that when you take the Bodhisattva vows, Bodhisattva vows, that is above that.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Above the Vinaya vows you take the Bodhisattva vows.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Bodhisattva vows can be like summarized and again it is simplified is.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Bodhisattva, Bodhijeta, have you told them, in order to become, you take the Bodhijeta vows.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Bodhijeta vows has two divisions.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Wishing Bodhijeta and actualizing Bodhijeta.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Wishing Bodhijeta.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And wishing Bodhijeta is intention, of course you all know that.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Intention developing, dropping, compassion taught in the heart.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 The principal essence of the Bodhijeta is compassion and wisdom.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Combination of compassion andlessness.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 What that means? Thinking about, by compassion you are thinking about all living beings.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.270
 To remove their suffering and difficulty, troubles, a likely benefit, help to all beings die of

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.000
 compassion.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 By wisdom you are projected to obtain more skill, more method, more rapid realization.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 So that you can apply that compassion and reach out to more easy to every living beings.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 So therefore it is a combination of the compassion and the wisdom.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And how that develops in the heart.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 How do you develop the uncondylation, unwelling and immense compassion when you develop that heart.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Thinking of all living beings.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And I like to really remove their suffering and difficulty.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 I like to help to call my best couple of letters.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 I really like to help with that.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 When you have that attitude towards mind, that is known as wishing bodhijeta.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Wishing bodhijeta.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 With that thought, now you take the vows.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 You take the vows again from the linear masters.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 The lineage, you take the vows.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Once you receive the vows, you become known as bodhisattvas.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Now, bodhisattva means a translated into English, created once for the enlightenment.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 So to reach enlightenment, we have to have courage.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 We have to have confidence.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 We have to have disturbance.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 We have to have open, vastness mind.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.380
 That is really the identity foundation and the key to fulfill the gain of the action of the bodhis

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.000
attvas.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 That does all we need.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Why we need courage?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Because to help the descent of beings is not easy.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Even you have the capability to help, like to help the descent of beings.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 You are determined to like to help the descent of beings.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 It's not always easy.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Not always easy.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 There are so many varieties of the emotions taught.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Even you do the best.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Maybe not necessarily understand exactly that way.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Instead that you help, the God may be the bodhisattva.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 There will be something to be upset.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 So therefore, you have to have courage.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Courage, commitment, that which is also known as patience.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Patience.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Patience for the hardship, the difficulty, the troubles that go through.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 This is also not just a short time commitment.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Bodhisattva has the commitment to free all the living beings to the enlightened status.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 All the living beings.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 How many beings there?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 According to the Buddha's teaching, there are even no numbers.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Numbers.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So many beings.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And so many these beings, each of them has so many emotions.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So many karmas.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 So many negative feelings.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So you have to swinging.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Swinging along the emotions like bumpy is right.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 It's everywhere.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Therefore, bodhisattva means the courage of one's body in life.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Keep courage, commitment, confidence.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Patience, all the openness, not becoming timid and tired and bored and depressed and drop down.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Then it's not bodhisattvas.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Long last go for the likeness.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Also in the teaching said, great master Shanti Devas and other great masters,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 if you have the determination to lend to help to all the sentient beings,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 treat it at that time with great compassion.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 What actually you are doing?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 You are purifying.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 We individually purify our karma, our obscurations, our negative witness.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Why don't you do that?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 We are gaining the accumulation merit.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 When we got accumulation merit, our physical basis becomes stronger.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Our immune system becomes stronger.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Stronger.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Shimmering that.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Shimmering that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 At the same time, you also have to meditate and agrade everything on the teachings.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Therefore, it's also really developing great, big wisdom.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Big wisdom and that purifying again have been dependent on the obscurations.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So among the two obscurations,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 negative obscurations, emotional obscurations are purifying,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 and knowledge obscurations are purifying.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 I'm sure you know all those terminologies and those other philosophies.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 You can even look to the Googles.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 You can look what means knowledge obscurations, what means emotional obscurations.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 You couldn't find that.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 For that reason, great master Shanti Devas said,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 when you have the great compassion,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 so even if you stay a long time in the samsara,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 your physical will be good shape, immune systems,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 those all are completely strong, developed.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 You will be very good state and you won't have the suffering.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 You won't have suffering.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And your wisdom mind is so strong, big,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 and therefore your mind will be mindful and happy,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 comfortable and happy,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 physical will be comfortable and happy.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Therefore, even if you stay a long time in the samsara by your compassion,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 you will not be bored and tired.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 This is really true.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Those great bodies are for great enlightenings.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 External looks like they are going to be such a big difficulty troubles.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 But reality level, maybe they are not exactly explaining things.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 That's what we see.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 So that's the lead by your power of realization.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Power of the merit starts forming.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Therefore, then it's known as you become the bodhisattva.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Now when you become the bodhisattva,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 you are protecting the vows,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 vows of the bodhicitta.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Then what do you do?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Now you have to keep that vows.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 One great master longkeeper said in the teachings,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 "The principal vows of the wishing bodhicitta is poor, boneless."

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Poor, boneless, we have sizzling quality,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 precious quality of the poor, boneless in the heart and mind.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 That is known as we are keeping up the vows of the wishing bodhicitta.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 And poor, boneless are how we shine.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 As we shine, bodhisattva,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 our gracious kindness compare your teacher's practices,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 bodhisattva, vedicayana.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And may all living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 That is boneless love.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Pray of the boneless love.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 And may all living beings are free from suffering and cause of suffering.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 That is boneless compassion.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 May all living beings always be a great joyful state without any suffering.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And that is boneless joy or boneless rejoice.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 May every living have the great realization of equanimity,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 free from the attachment to the close ones and rejection to the others.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 That is boneless of the equanimities.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 When we joined that, we not just merely left service or joined it,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 but really wishing sincerely in the heart and mind.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Mind, we are upkeeping the vows of the wishing bodhicitta.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 That is what we vows of the wishing bodhicitta.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 And then now, what is the vows of the actualizing bodhicitta?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Again, the great master of the mukimba said,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 the wishing bodhicitta.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 The vows of the actualizing bodhicitta is six paramatas.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Six paramatas.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Transcendent, generous paramata is translated.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And morality paramatas.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Patience paramatas.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 During the effort of paramatas, concentrated paramatas

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 and the wisdom paramatas.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Those are the six paramatas.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 But best upon the poor, boneless.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 That means the generous paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 And morality paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 Patience paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And the joyful effort paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Concentrated paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And wisdom paramata best upon the poor, boneless.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And we keep that sizzling in the heart and mind, then do the activity of the six paramatas.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 That is known as the vows of the wishing bodhicitta.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Very simple.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Another word also in the teaching said, can be very or tired bodhic chadasi.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Bodhisattva's vows can be summarized into these three.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Those are known as morality that will avoid all the negativities.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 All the negativities.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Morality that will gather all the virtues.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 And morality that will benefit for all living beings.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 All living beings.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So that three is the summary of the vows of the bodhicitta.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Bodhisattva's.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Which is best upon the Vinaya vows.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Either way, whether it's lay practitioner or whether it's ordinary practitioners.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 That is best upon them.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Then next one is the Vediyana vows.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 And I'm going to stop here today and we go tomorrow.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And already I think Lama Laya sent already email where we are going to continue this retreat.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Other weeks and practices that are reminded of the Dharma.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Or represent our understanding of the Dharma.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 So that we can observe nicely and carry that on.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And then also we do the healing practice for all the living beings going through really that.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And then also not just healing.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 This cause of this sicknesses too.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 And then all the suffering and difficulty.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Every living being is going through that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 So this practice of what we're going to do with healing practices.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 It's just for all the purposes.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Really to a kind of wishing that.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And then more targeted with all the current situation.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 And that is then our bodhisattva activity too.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Bodhisattva that's what we can do.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And the following also instructs of the doctors.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Expertise everything.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And maintain our self well-being.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And also help to the others.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 All that is really bodhisattva activity.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And then many I think understand.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 There also is really good not go out.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And which is good for you.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And also good for the others that which is good for them.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 So we follow this instruction.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 And we line up in the teaching what we're talking of.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 What we follow.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 The teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So that's how my talk today.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Thank you very much everyone.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Again thank you.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Now we do that again.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Just short meditation.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Very short meditation.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And then we do the healing practices.
