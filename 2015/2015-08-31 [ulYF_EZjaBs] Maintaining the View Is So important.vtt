00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 Good afternoon. Again, we understand that our ritual motivation of the bodhijata, also in the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 teaching, known as Vasmus motivation of the bodhijata, expanding, increasing and activating that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.000
 motivation, that intention.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 And then, as well as also purity under the strength of the Vajrayana teaching on the Bhagavata

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.620
 teaching. Bring up that, because we are practicing the Vajrayanas, and so therefore bring those

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.000
 beautiful qualities.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.510
 All is nature of our mind. All is nature. We are not doing any alien or any strange things. Because

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 the Buddha teaching is absolutely best on the nature where things are.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 So, we are exploring our beauty on our nature. That is all about it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Now, with this understanding, we move to the luminous clay essence teachings of Vyamma Maharajas.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.420
 And now, this teaching is the first kind of lay out as a ground Tantra, or as I said, foundation

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.000
 Tantra, part Tantra, resolve Tantras.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.980
 And Tantra, I said, and you must also read this book, and Tantra is our mind stream, nature of the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.000
 mind.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.560
 Tantra means continuations. We is continued from the bigger less times, is continued. Until now, it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 will continue in the future.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.650
 Therefore, it is unceasing, flowing of our system of the mind, or the mind stream. That is basic

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.000
 Tantra.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Basic or the foundation of the ground Tantra is totally emptiness.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Beyond that existing and non-existing, neither and either as teaching always says.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 In the Mahayana teaching, Mademaka teaching, Dzogchi teaching. It is the same thing.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 There is not many different ground, many different foundation, many different verse.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 We are touching the same ground, same verse, where we are touching the Dzogchi teaching or

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.000
 practices, Mahamadhara practices, or any Vayayana practices, or any teachings.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.810
 Actually, same thing, we are touching to that nature. That nature is your nature of mind, my nature

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.000
 of mind.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Here, say, ground Tantra, ground Pandryaka Tantra.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 Since we have this beautiful ground Tantra or the Pandryaka Tantra, therefore, now we like to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.000
 discover.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Why we like to discover? Because we are out of the game, in a way, out of our nature systems.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 We are carried by the force of the energy of the flowing of ground, energy for this nature.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 That is known as duality. Duality is the force of the flowing nature systems, energy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 If we didn't grasp it, clinging, duality is fine. That energy is perfectly fine.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 But since we grasp it, clinging. Clinging is not natural. Grasping is not the nature.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Therefore, we dilute it because of dualities, because of the grasping.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.210
 Today, when we follow the path of the Tantra, we are transcendenting, releasing of that duality or

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.000
 that grasping and clinging.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.110
 That is what. In order to discover this nature, in order to follow that, going back to the nature

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.000
 as it is,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.700
 then, first, the most important is the will. Will is so important because that's the will, that one

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.000
.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.390
 That's the one in which we reverse back to our nature, all homes with home, home to sweet home, by

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.000
 this.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Otherwise, we would like to do something, but we look at something in different directions.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.340
 That's what we've been. We're thinking we like to do the good things for ourselves, to the others

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.000
 too.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.520
 But we did that. We missed the point. We're looking at the wrong directions, wrong things, always

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.000
 looking something different.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 This time, we're looking back to the natural way things are.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Looking into the natural way things are is known as will. Will is when we think of will as one.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.490
 For example, in the world, what we call subject and object. What is this will? Will is subject or

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.000
 will is object.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Think that, and since we're here, we started, think that if this will is subject or will is object.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Will is subject. Will is your understanding.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.620
 Your understanding of intelligence are sharpening, expanding, and looking to all the territories of

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.000
 the subject.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Subject, but automatically is subject, your mind. Will. Will.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 The object is not going to view us. The subject is going to view us. It's our intelligence.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.860
 Therefore, will is so important. Will is like light that we are going to continually keep up all

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.000
 the way to the enlightenment.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 This is what is like light. It will usher us. It will bring back to our best or ground.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.110
 It will always be activating, refining, activating. It will like, when it's like modern time here,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.000
 what's called time release.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.430
 It will make time release adjustment of the realization, bring back to our track, track so that we

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.000
're not lost in our track.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Therefore, will is so important. I mean, this is the foundation.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.560
 When you follow the path, path that with will, with means, all the other activities, such as they

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.000
 are listed in the nine or eleven different things or ten different things.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.350
 It is all the means of activating the will. Activating, refining, glorifying, deepening of our

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.000
 realization of the will.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.400
 This is all about that, about this. Therefore, will is so important. For those reasons, the Buddha

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.000
 is teaching.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.610
 As K.T. Pandey here, when you said many times, satay, and when it's in Tibet, rakpati, hyapso, dem

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.000
ba, med, have the beautiful will and with solid standing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Standing with, solid standing with footsteps, our footsteps. We're going to walk as we see.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.690
 That is known as looking to our path and walking with that. It's beauty walks. That is beauty walks

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.000
.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.110
 And not looking to the path and walking on the, somewhere walking that. That is dangerous walks, I

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.000
 think.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 That is, that will lead you, you don't know where you're going to lead.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 But when you walk with the eye, that is beauty walks. Will is like eye. Will is like light.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 That will assure us our path, clear way and bring the brightness and goodness.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 So that is the other meaning of this will is so important.
