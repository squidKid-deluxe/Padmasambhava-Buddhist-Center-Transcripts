00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 "And that is immovable of the body, immovable of the senses, immovable of the awareness. Those are

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.500
 three immovable."

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.760
 "In immovable of the body, which means, I already said, postures, have good postures, or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.180
 comfortable postures, or sitting on a chair, whichever comfortable, but not, during the meditation,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.000
 you should not have uncomfortable."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 "Whatever comfortable practices, so comfortable."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.130
 "But even though it's sitting on a chair, according to teaching, trying to keep backspains, those

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.500
 are straight up, shoulders are extended, and bellies are pulled a little bit in, not loose."

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 "So that means your waist and all those are kind of straight up, and head held up, kind of straight

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 up there. And now, that is the immovable of the body."

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.670
 "And the immovable of the senses, that means, I already mentioned earlier, all senses, eyes, ears,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.800
 nose, everything, live as it is. Nothing really changes. Even in Dzogchen teaching, it will open

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.500
 the eyes, not widely, but open the eyes, look into the spaces."

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 "Swiss, those are the teachings here. Go into the space."

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.840
 "Why?" The teachings said, "When you open the eyes, the clarity comes. Your meditation will become

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 more clarity."

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.570
 "What in those experiences, meditators said, in the teaching, and I heard truth from those orally

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.500
 heard."

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 "First, when we meditate, stabilizing mind is so important. Stabilizing. So that is stable."

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 "One mind is more like stabilized. Stabilized, then mostly important is clarity."

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.570
 Clarity means meditation with more press, more clay, more bullying, not dull, sitting, kind of

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.500
 stable. Clay, the pristine, that is really important.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.150
 And in order to do that, and this eye, you open the eye, look into the space, according to the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.500
 teaching, it will help. It will be more clarity.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.660
 Clarity and that will also open the inborn wisdom too, according to the teaching. So it is very

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 good.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.500
 So then, you meditate. Now, meditator is now, you meditate on the Dzogchen state.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:55.500
 The non-ness, that is what we discussed in the teaching said, non-ness, you are really relaxed.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500
 That is it. And now there is nothing else.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 Meditation, practice, during the Dzogchen meditation, meditation only, is really there.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 That is what the Garab Dorji is teaching. It's upon the hour. Recognize one's own inner nature.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.280
 And then, second, one's resolutions. Resolutions. That means not lingering so many different things

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.500
.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 Now stay. You should be happy. Because Dzogchen practice encompasses everything.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 Dzogchen practice is really like it. By practicing Dzogchen meditation, it will subdue negativity.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 It will purify all the negativities. It will, by close connection to our amibok, we are not just

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.500
 close connection.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 We are in a three-gaya state of mind. So therefore, it is all practices. It encompasses everything.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 Everything means it encompasses the guru. It encompasses the guru practices.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
 It encompasses the yidam practices. It encompasses the nakini practices.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.500
 It encompasses everything, all the practices. So therefore, one resolution to Dzogchen meditation

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 and then meditate.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 Continue maintaining that. Meditating is not an effort to meditate.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 But relaxing. Carefree. For those reasons, in teaching, great master's knowledge is on the set.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:05:04.500
 And never after that, never changed. Never propagated.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 Keep as it is, as it is in the nature. Without any effort.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 And nothing holding. Never holding. Not holding anything.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 And if you keep that way, that is the way all the brothers have went and got realization.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 All the brothers coming, going to get realization. That is the way. That's it.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.500
 So not changing, not altering, not trying to do this and that, but simply relaxing.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:51.500
 And not pulsing. And then relaxing. That's where get hold of realization.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.500
 So for that reason here, His Holid Munir Midsit here, in the Kaulana of Hayyid.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.500
 The letting go in the free, natural flow of the uncontructible awareness.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.500
 Leave as it is. Carefree. Not trying to regulate.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.500
 And we're trying to regulate something. That is the duality. That is the publication.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.500
 That is the conception. That is, we are, is, what's called, we dilute our meditation.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500
 And we're trying to do that. Then really it's conceptual.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.500
 That is the duality. What does that mean? Then that is root of samsara.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500
 Root of the obscurations. We're creating the samsara.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 We're releasing samsara to the Dhammakaya status as it is.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 So here, that is flow of the uncontructible awareness status.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.500
 And then here, He's only saying, same thing as the Nārjuna teachings.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.500
 Not holding. What's ever arises. Not holding.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:11.480
 Thought comes. The display of the Dhammakaya, or in other words, thought will come where you med

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.500
itate.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.500
 It's energy flow. Dhammakaya energy. And that energy is in it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 Dokriti what says it? Sambukaya, Nārmakaya energy.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.500
 That, they are the Nārmakaya. They are the Sambukaya energy.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.500
 Come, it will flow. But don't block. Don't regulate it.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.500
 When you regulate it, that, I say, is a duality. It's samsara mind.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.500
 So, He says, not holding. What's ever arises. What ever is good thoughts.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.500
 Bad thoughts. Different visions. Different imaginations.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.100
 Kind of in the mind comes sometimes. Not sometimes, many times it comes. Really. All the different

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.500
 things.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 Maybe sometimes the kind of silliness comes. And sometimes the kind of water falls.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.500
 And then we try and think, oh, this beautiful cooling. That is the trick trick.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.500
 We are tricked by our own displays. It's all come from display.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:26.500
 It is good, good things. All such good things, joy and devotion bodies are there.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.500
 Even it comes. Very cool. Even it is good.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:39.500
 And bad things such as emotions, stress force, all our kind of vast memories, vast different things

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.500
.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500
 Our childhood memories, whatever. It's all kind of comes.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.500
 Those could come. All imagination, something comes up to you.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 Maybe nothing happened. At least this lifetime.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 But some kind of like those habits went away.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.500
 Not analyze this and that thing. Then that is the witness of the duality.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.500
 Then it's tricky hearts. So that is all in the mind.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:15.500
 Also on our sense side, things see good things. Or beautiful things.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.500
 Or maybe not so good things see. Or heard some noise.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.500
 Those are good, not excellent. Smell everything. Whatever it is.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.500
 Not regulating, not normulating, not discriminating, not labeling.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.500
 Those this and that. That is duality. That is a trick.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.500
 Trick. Even though this all kind of came.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:48.500
 So therefore he said his own thing of self-liberation. Liberated.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.500
 This liberated is again what Garabdol is. A third world teacher.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:00.500
 Liberated on the confidence of the world. Liberating.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:07.500
 The great Master Popper would emphasize that our progress of the meditation.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.500
 Doki meditation is 100% the relying of the way we are liberating.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.500
 Every day we are able to liberate it as it arises.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.500
 Our practice really is going so smooth.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.500
 And we don't liberate it as it arises. Even we recognize the teaching.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.500
 Even we have good understanding of Doki practices or teachings.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:37.500
 We stop. So the cornerstone or the landmark of the realization

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.500
 or not realization is really measured by this liberation.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.500
 That is it. That liberation is the during the meditation,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500
 during the post-meditation. It is not just only the meditation time.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500
 During the post-meditation. Also liberated.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.500
 We are able to liberate it whatever the consequence comes externally.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.500
 Immediately that is number one.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.500
 As it arises. As that moment liberated.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500
 Then what the great Master Popper would say.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.500
 That moment you uprooted the source of suffering.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:30.500
 Among the post-Buddha's teaching, the poor noble truth. First is the source of suffering truth.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.500
 And the source of suffering is what? The source of suffering truth is what?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.500
 Is negative emotions.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.500
 Anger. Jealous. Headed thought.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.500
 And then underneath is ignorance. Ignorance is supported to it.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500
 Ignorance is behind the scene.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:55.500
 Ignorance we can't see again. It's so naive. So deep.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.500
 But the anger and the jealous and the hated thought and the doubt.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 Those are surface and active. It's underneath. It's completely saturated with ignorance.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.500
 But when those arise, we can see our mind.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500
 We know our mind. When it arises that.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.500
 That instant we are able to liberate it.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.500
 That moment we uprooted the source of suffering truth.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.500
 When we uprooted the source of suffering, we did that moment.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 Then is uprooted suffering truth.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.500
 So false truth. True. The poor noble truth by the great Master Popper.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 We uprooted right that moment. That particular thing even.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.500
 Therefore. And that is really the progress.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.500
 If we are able to do that is what many times in defining moment,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.500
 the practicing and not practicing, the way we liberate it.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.500
 If we liberate it, we are practitioners. If we are not liberating,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.500
 then we are even may have name, practitioner or practicing, not just a name.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.500
 We are practicing for what? But still our strength of realization is weak.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.500
 We are just the same as others. Others cannot liberate.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.500
 Others not practicing. Then they follow up the emotions.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.500
 And then we follow up the emotions.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.500
 What the great teacher Buddha used example.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.500
 When you throw a stone to the dog,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.500
 the dog goes up the stones.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.500
 When that stone if you throw to the lion,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.500
 lion will not go up the stone.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.500
 Come to the throw of stones.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500
 So then if we follow the emotions,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.500
 we are imitating as a dog. Dogi.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.500
 Dogi. But when we go to the souls,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
 immediately we are relieved.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.500
 Taking the example of the lion according to the great teacher Buddha Chaka Muni.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 So this liberating is so, so important for all of us.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500
 For all of us really that we can do that.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500
 And even you couldn't liberate immediately,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 but after maybe two minutes,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.500
 ten minutes after we can liberate, it adjusted that.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.500
 Then it's good, really good.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500
 But then there is also maybe already mess.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500
 Mess, so it's really difficult.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500
 But before making the mess,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.500
 at that instant if we can handle that,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.500
 then truly we are the bodhisattvas.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.500
 Bodhisattva means what?

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.500
 It sounds good word, but it sounds like the courageous ones

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.500
 for the enlightenment.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.500
 Really, really one for the enlightenment.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.500
 That is great.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500
 And we live with it.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 For that reason, Buddha said, named the victorious ones.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.500
 It's not that victorious, they pulled with the wall

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.500
 and killed people with soul, this and that.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.500
 But they paired the wall with negative emotions.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500
 They subdued.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.500
 Therefore, they are victorious ones.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.500
 Jara, Dadyumba, conquered.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.500
 Those are all terminology used.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.500
 Arhathas, those are used.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:17.500
 Because they subdued the very fundamental of the troubles

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.500
 and that obstacles, really that.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.500
 So that is really a liberation.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
 That is liberating.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.500
 And by letting go, in the pre-natural flow

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.500
 of the uncontrollable awareness

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.500
 and then not holding the whatever arises,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.500
 the blessings of the self-liberation are obtained.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.500
 Then truly you attain the blessings.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.500
 Blessings of your strength of the lineage teaching,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 a strength of your realization and a strength of your own.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500
 Promote your wisdom.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500
 Three Gayas.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
 Dharma Gaya, Samgoh Gaya.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 Gaya and Nirmah Gayas.
