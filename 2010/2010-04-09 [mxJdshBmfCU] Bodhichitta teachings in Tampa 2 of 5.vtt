00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 And so now, about this bodhichitta, then I think many of you all know when there are two ways to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.100
 develop this bodhichitta.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:17.140
 One is known as the wishing bodhichitta, and the other is actualizing bodhichitta.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.280
 And the wishing bodhichitta is something that sincerely thinks in our heart and mind.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.180
 Mind likes to help to other beings.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:38.860
 And the nature of the bodhichitta is also known as is open mind, and free from greedy and selfish.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:48.060
 And generally, according to the Buddha's teaching, we, or in Buddhism, that we not just came here

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.780
 for the first time in this samsara, or this world,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 nor this is not the last time we will behave. We will go on and on.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 It's just like turning the page. Our life is like kind of book.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.700
 We go turn the page, and page after page, and chapter after chapter, continually goes on.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.250
 And how we are going? There are three kinds of ways to travel going through this, according to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.940
 Buddhism.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 One is with traveling with great understanding, great awareness, with great awareness, the clarity

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420
 they are ballooning.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.580
 And the other is just going, it's taking away. Wherever it hits, it hits.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:45.090
 There is nothing turning, nothing can do, it's just moving, whatever it does, by chance. That's the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.980
 one way.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.380
 So two ways. And this, the majority of when we are traveling on this samsara journey,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.660
 journey is just kind of almost like blame, the dark. We have no idea what will happen.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.100
 Why this is happening is due to the ego clinking, and due to the ignorance.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.860
 Ignorant is blocked our clarity. We don't really see anything beside the small area, very local

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 area.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.820
 That's what we see. We see, and everything is just a presumption status, or everything is just a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.060
 kind of like imagination.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.980
 Hopeful status. Hopeful status. There's nothing that clarity is, because ego clinking is blocking.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.460
 And when we have such, this ego clinking is what it does. It always makes self-important.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.180
 Our self becomes so important. One's own self is become the number one, and then rest maybe is just

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.660
 a second,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.700
 and then it goes on and on, on. But one own self is so important, important, and that's known as

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.060
 ego clinking.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 Ego clinking or the self-important, and a greed. Greed. And that's how our ego does.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:26.220
 But this body japa is completely opposite. It is selfless. It's greedless. You're breaking that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.260
 wall,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.380
 that icy, cold wall that we develop, the life after life, self-important, greedy, and ego clinking,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.860
 that cocoon, cocoon that we break that shell, and open our self, make way to everyone.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.420
 When we have self-kindness, self-fickness, and self-important content, what it does,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 we always create so much regiment consumption with narrow thoughts of the negative emotions,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:04.220
 such as, known as ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, hated thought, then greed,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.100
 and making so many different excuses, one after another, whether what the kind of, whatever the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:17.420
 available ego, the ex-chooses that support the self-important self-fulfillment, we make that.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.900
 But that in it, even though for a short moment, maybe it serves some purpose, but deep drawn,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.660
 we're creating such a negative, very heavy impact that registering in the self-continent

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.460
 storehouse, according to Buddhism, creating such a deep karma. That karma print is not going to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.220
 release immediately. It's not going to remove immediately. Even we use the million terms of,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:55.500
 what's called, detergent. Detergent, or this color fox? What? Clorox bleach. Even in use,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.100
 it's not going to go away. It's not going to go away. Once we did that negative things,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.900
 this is going to stay. And consequence, when it returns back, going to experience by our self,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:19.020
 we created this. Therefore, in Buddhism, you all know, what we see is in our environment,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.900
 our vision is self-created vision that's reflecting back to us. We created, we have to go through

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.660
 that,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:36.540
 whether it's good or whether it's bad. Therefore, due to this ego clinging, self-important and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.100
 selfish and greedy thought, that ego always makes one way or the other directly, indirectly,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:51.020
 and that made ourselves more kind of secluded and eyes and cold and dark and just deep all the time

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.020
,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.340
 live after life, and then carried so much kind of turbulence of the negative karma and negative

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.580
 energies and that kind of hurting us and hurting others and that went. In the midst of that

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.460
 turbulence, there is the kind of like Buddha and that this love and kindness, compassion, light,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.940
 the kind of occasionally erupting that it helps us, guiding us, and then it just kind of again

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.700
 bloat and covered by all thick mists of this habit pattern, negative emotion, negative things like

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.940
 that.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:30.300
 And that is known as the karmic things. In order to break that shield, break that regiment,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:39.100
 that wall, then the bodhicitta. That is what we need. Bodhicitta is a complete opposite of

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:48.300
 self-important. Bodhicitta is a complete opposite of the selfishness and the greedy and that is

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:56.860
 complete opposite. If we have the true bodhicitta or even not completely 100% bodhicitta, if

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.420
 somebody

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.060
 we have the bodhicitta, we have the, in a global level, we have the world peace. We don't have to

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:11.500
 worry anything. We really have the bodhicitta. Even 25% bodhicitta, definitely we will have the

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.980
 world peace that everybody is talking, every politician, everyone is talking, the world peace,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.140
 harmony, and joy. We will have that. Why we are not having the world peace? Peace and all those

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:31.420
 measurables that went in history and happen now most of the time is the lack of the bodhicitta

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.060
 and self-important and the greedy and hungry of the power, then all that. And that's what

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:44.380
 all this creation is. So therefore, this bodhicitta is so special and many different levels,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:52.570
 individual level, guru level, family level, and the country level, and we really have the bodhic

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.940
itta.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:03.180
 Then the true peace, joy, happiness, and harmony, respect, and appreciation that we

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:10.380
 all talk on occasionally, that all comes with this bodhicitta. Therefore, this bodhicitta,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:17.180
 therefore that reason, Buddha and all those great masters practitioners, one voice,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:24.060
 appreciate and emphasize again and again, again and again how this is important.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:31.790
 They, all these great teachers and great masters, they practice bodhicitta, they lived with bodhic

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.220
itta,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.460
 they prefer bodhicitta, they become the great symbol of the peace and joy and happiness,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:44.780
 to even they gone 14 years ago, still partially is appropriate. And remember,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:51.980
 because it's a power of this bodhicitta. Therefore, this bodhicitta is so special. I mean that,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:59.100
 you know, it's not something that I'm talking, something that you don't know, just reminding us,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.940
 as we had this opportunity, we talk, I'm talking that. But this bodhicitta is so special,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.940
 special. And therefore, every, all those great practitioners, masters in the teaching said,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.700
 before they pay homage, every time they pay homage to the bodhicitta, bodhicitta,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.620
 pay homage to bodhicitta, pay homage to bodhicitta. That's why the bodhicitta is, I mean,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:29.180
 this is just, it's so special, so important. Everything is relying on this enlightenment

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.020
 and everything. So therefore, this is the bodhicitta.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:50.940
 Thank you.
