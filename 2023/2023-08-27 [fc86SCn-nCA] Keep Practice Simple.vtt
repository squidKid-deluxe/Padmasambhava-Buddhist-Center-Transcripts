00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 This is received, this is received. And they have a lot of record of the resume teaching these days

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.000
.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 But if they didn't put the practice, that won't help completely as we wanted it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Yeah, but practice is simple. I mean, practice is so important.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 And practice is also simple. Don't touch the best foundation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 We call it common or general practices, such as bodhicata, poor boneless talk, poor renunciation

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.000
 talk.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Those are what the money comes because those are basic.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 That is so important. Backing is the ground.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 From there we have to develop. We know the best, basic things.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Really, this hovering, this hovering in the sky is not settled.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And therefore, they know mostly we leave this world, a world with empty hands.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.360
 That's nothing much to gain. And also we heard so many times, but we didn't have the confidence to

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.000
 practice it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Therefore, we don't have much confidence when you leave this world.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So therefore, practice is so important with devotion, with joy, in appreciation of bodhicata.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 And then with this world, in three various stages or three higher stages.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So those are kind of activated those, as this is part of our practice in meditation.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And the target is now we go to the zouki teaching.
