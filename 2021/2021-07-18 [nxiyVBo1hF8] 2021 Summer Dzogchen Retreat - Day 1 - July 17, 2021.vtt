00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 Okay, again, thank you very much, everyone. Thank you again. All my Dharma friends, thank

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.560
 you very much for participating. And again, we are doing Dzogchen retreat about one week

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.800
 or the more. And it's wonderful we all get together and had the opportunity to discuss

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.320
 the teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, or Guru Padmasambha, lineage master,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.400
 according our capabilities. And in a way, refreshing, reactivating our knowledge and

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 the memories, the teaching that we received from so many great masters one after another.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.000
 So today, we really, in a way, reactivating that according my capabilities to, in a way,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.200
 reminding to all of us. It's not something that I have offered to you as something new,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.840
 completely brand new, or something come up. It's all teachings of the gracious teacher,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 Buddha Shakyamuni, lineage masters, and I try to follow that footstep according my capabilities

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.960
 of utmost capabilities and hear that to each other in a way to remind each other. So that's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 what is all what we're doing. And particularly this time, we're discussing of the Dzogchen

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 teachings, which is so important, so powerful, so precious, so, so great practices, yet is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.240
 down to the earth. Humble, simple, more contentment, filled heart with both each other, relative

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.360
 to both each other. When we have heart filled with related to both each other, then the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 absolute both each other of Dzogchen shines in the heart. It comes up really perfectly.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.380
 So that's what we're really trying to do that. And again, and for that reasons, again, every

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.400
 great masters, all great practitioners, the Buddha, everyone said, post is so important

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.600
 to participate in the teaching and to participate in that. And that, but second, the most important

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.280
 is correcting the motivation, correcting the motivation. What gracious teacher Buddha Shakya

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:36.580
 Swami says, everything is a condition. That condition is our mind. Every, every, everything

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:47.560
 is a demand after growth is had need conditions. That also indicating we have the perfect cause.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.160
 We all of us had the perfect cause, many times lacking the conditions. And this time we like

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:06.800
 to explore our goodness, our abundance of the Buddha nature or Dzogchen teaching, Dzogchen,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.840
 not just Dzogchen teaching, Dzogchen. Dzogchen is not coming from outside. And what is the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.160
 very word Dzogchen? Many times it's oscillated in the English. Great completions or great

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.760
 perfect, but that great perfect, that great completion is not outside. We're looking.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.480
 It's within the heart, within the mind. That is one voice said from the Mahayana Sutra,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.600
 all the way to Dzogchen teaching is within us. That is what we're going to explore. But

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:54.080
 to explore, we need conditions. That condition is also coming from outside. Everything is

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:03.600
 equipped with us. The old tools to discover is everything with us. That condition, what

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:13.320
 great teacher said, everything is caused with conditions. That condition is motivation.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:23.640
 Motivation. What is motivation? Motivation is nothing but our own mind. Our mind, your

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:35.240
 mind and my mind. Who control the mind? No one else control our mind except ours. 100%

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:46.600
 one. Each of us control our own mind. So where we like to lead our destination, according

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.880
 to Buddhism or with us and all the great masters is to the motivation. We like to, for example,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:06.200
 always talk of the goodness. Everyone really goodness, good motivation. Everyone don't

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:16.320
 care of the goodness, then be careful. Be kind of like carry away or with our old habitu,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.960
 manding, manding habitu patterns like carries. Then what the destination will be? According

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.000
 to Buddhism, the destination will be continually going in the samsara, from samsara to the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.200
 samsara. Instead going from nirvana or the bhumi to the bhumi or the path to the path

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:46.920
 or realization to the realization we are heading to the samsara, from samsara to the samsaras.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:57.560
 To change that direction is no one's in hand except ourself according to Buddha teaching.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.840
 That is motivation. Therefore, correct in the motivation is so important. This time,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.200
 what kind of correct? What kind of motivation actually exists? Generally, in a correct teacher,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.840
 Buddha is teaching. There are so many motivations. Motivation means mind. There are so many.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.720
 But we can summarize that into three. Good motivation, bad motivation, neutral motivations.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:35.320
 Or positive, negative, neutral. And this time, teaching says correct in the motivation to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:44.440
 the good. Good motivation. That again is summarized by the lineage masters that you all know.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:53.480
 We've known vastness, skillful means motivation. Vastness, skillful means motivation. No, sorry.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:03.240
 I made mistakes. Vastness motivation, skillful means motivation. So this true mind, true

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.200
 motivation. Vastness motivation of the Mahayana suttas. Skillful means motivation of the Vedayana

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:20.360
 teachings. These true motivations. We have the abundance of both teachings. Suttara teachings

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.080
 and Vedayana teachings. Because kindness, courage, and the commitment of the ancient

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.880
 those great masters, particularly known as Garpa and Masambhava, and great master Shandarakkita,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:41.520
 and great Dharma Kintusandapri, with all those great athletics and Indian masters,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:52.120
 made such a big effort to bring the entire teaching of the Buddha into Tibet. So therefore,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.720
 all the Tibetan Buddhists, Buddhisms are enjoying abundance, the richness of the Buddha's teaching,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:07.300
 without missing any Buddha's teaching that exists in this world that will have, that will have to

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.400
 be,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:16.680
 or that we can get enlightenment within these lifetimes. And therefore, we have two motivations.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:24.440
 Skillful, vastness motivation of the Suttarayana teachings and skillful means

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.520
 motivation of the Vedayana teachings. What these two motivations are generally? Again,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:41.120
 is nothing, any that you all know, except actually, you all know vastness motivation is bodhicitta.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:53.080
 Bodhicitta, wishing bodhicitta, a relative true bodhicitta, relative bodhicitta, wishing, vastness.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:01.960
 Why is it called vastness? Because bodhicitta has no boundaries. That we know, right? We all know,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:11.080
 we heard that, and we're practicing that. Has no boundaries, no restrictions. And to all the

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:18.840
 beings, how many beings there, according to Buddha's teaching, that as far as space goes,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:29.800
 that far there is living beings. As long as there is living beings, that much,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:41.360
 everyone has karma, everyone has emotions. Everyone is struggling, that means karma and

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:50.760
 emotions. It's pervasive to all the beings. Therefore, our bodhicitta is to all the beings,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:58.120
 wishing good things, particularly this time, today I'm going there. And I'm today, and as

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:04.760
 well as for one week or 10 days, I'm going to practice of Dzogchen. Dzogchen made that become

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:13.880
 the cause to bring everyone as joy, peace, happiness now, but deep down may completely

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:21.400
 eliminate the cause of trouble, difficulty, and challenges. Really, we sincerely from the heart.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:31.000
 Part, our intention, motivation, swinging with it, with the aspirations, supreme aspirations of

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.040
 the great bodhisattvas or the Buddhas, join Dzogchen, let that spirit ripple all the

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.760
 Northern light, and just spread out all the morning sunlight to everyone, rich from the heart.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.120
 Really

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:55.280
 rich, and then apply all the bodhicitta teaching we have, we received. That is known as vastness

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:04.240
 motivation of the bodhicitta, according to Mahayana suttas. Skill means the motivation of the

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.520
 Vedayana teaching, vast upon that motivation, the suttas of Mahayana motivation, with the

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.840
 compassion, with the bodhicitta, and now what skill means? Vedayana teaching is Mahayana teaching,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.040
 but it has more skillful means as we all know. We all heard that. And what are those skillful

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.680
 means? This has so many skillful way, so many techniques to way discover our Buddha-natural,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:40.440
 and so many skillful way to clarify our obscurations. Because of those skillful means,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.080
 the technique is not too difficult to do. Hard shapes, a little bit more easy approach,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:57.560
 and we keep our mindfulness, a joyful effort, and concentration. Then it is quite easy, not

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:05.240
 difficult. So those are, why? Because a lot of skillful means. So this time, the bodhicitta,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.840
 our vastness motivation of the bodhicitta is combined with the motivation, skillful means

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:20.200
 motivation. That is, then, simple to explain. There are three Vedya states. All forms are

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:28.280
 Vedya forms. What that means, Vedya? Enlightenment. All forms are enlightenment. All the sounds are

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 enlightenment. And all the mind and space are enlightened. Why use the Vedya? According to

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:43.960
 teaching, Vedya means indestructible. Indestructible. This enlightenment, what we're

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.040
 activating of these three forms, sound and space, mind, enlightenment is never going to change.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:13:00.680
 It's reality. It's ultimate, ordinary nature. But we don't see now. Why? Because of our duality.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:08.520
 That very we want to purify. That hindrance we want to purify. That's a simple way. Then

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.240
 like to come in a little more extensive ways, skillful means the motivation, what is

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:22.680
 perfect status. Perfect pure land, or perfect land, perfect teacher, perfect retinues,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:31.720
 audience, and perfect teaching, and perfect time. Those are the five perfects. You activate those

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.480
 qualities. This is now, again, not just making up these things or trying to pertend this.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:50.120
 It's reality. We are recapturing our dominion, our inheritance, our share, our opportunities.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:59.800
 According to the Buddha's teaching, we lost that our origin dominion because carried by the

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:07.880
 force of the dualities, habit patterns. We went always looking outside, looking out,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:16.360
 and further and further we went. That ripple is carried, that tide of the duality has been carried

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.200
 from our source completely. It's kind of carried. But today by the teaching of the great teacher

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 Buddha Shakta Muni and Gaurab and Masambhava, we are returning back to our original dominion.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.480
 That our original place where we belong, where we are, actually we never lost.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:50.760
 Only we had the nightmare carried. Carried far, far. That is what we're really doing. Therefore,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.600
 then activating those bodies and those motivations is so important because they're teaching.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.080
 Really, so important. Teaching all the great masters, everyone said, so important. That will

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.200
 change. That will change from deep, not from surface, outside somewhat. Change from the very

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.960
 fundamental. So therefore, with all those beautiful motivations. With that beautiful motivations,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:25.080
 then now we follow with the teaching. And the teaching is again zoki teaching, zoki teaching,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:33.500
 and it's taught by the great master. The manjushri who came in whom he found is great master Mohar

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.440
ambhut.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.000
 And of course, many of you already know, all read, so I won't repeat that. If you like,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.600
 I mean the Moharambhut is one of the great masters, great scholars, great logicians,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:54.620
 great portraitists, great alchemists. He's really in the debate history in the Buddhist all the

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:54.920
 time

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:03.000
 and great thinker, but yet he's so humble, simple, drawn to the earth. He's just like as a regular

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.240
 monk, a practitioner, moving from hermit to hermit. That means from mountain to mountain,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:17.320
 cave with caves. Even he become, and he born as an ordinary person. Nothing kind of fancy and

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.120
 highlighted all this and that things. In the debate, there are so many of those beings

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.280
 that who are highlighted. Truly they are very highlighted that. But Moharambhut is one of the,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.880
 again, great masters who born as simple families in the 18th century, I think around the 18th

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.360
 century,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:46.200
 or maybe in the 19th century, sorry, 19th century centuries. And I grew up as a simple person,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:55.480
 and a simple monk started just exactly regular monks, monks. And he see it like that all the time.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.760
 It's not something that, and then of course he's called it a realization, understand the knowledge.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:07.960
 It's like genius. He is a genius to knew all the Buddha teachings. They never had to start it like

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:14.280
 that. As soon as he received teaching in the transmissions of those teachings, he knew already.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:22.360
 And not guess only that, all the knowledges. He practiced and meditated all the time. He's a great

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:30.120
 practitioner. And this gives so many different teachings, so many variety teachings that covers

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:37.400
 all the major sciences, and it will be called five sciences. Those really, he give all those

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.200
 teachings, but regularly he gives teachings of all that are covered in the Buddhist, Buddha's

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.680
 teachings,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:50.520
 from the first foundation, the foundation teaching of Buddha teaching, all the first teachings,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:56.840
 and all the way to Dokti teachings. And there's more many kind of essence teachings of the

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.560
 different

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:07.720
 teachings, and this is one of his very direct pointed, and very condensed teaching of the Dokti,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:18.120
 Dokti teachings. So now we go here, and we go here, and that now, so now here we,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.840
 and page 10, I'm sure you know that, is

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:39.960
 the here, the title, the essential point of the effortless profound meditations. So that's what

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.640
 the translated, I think we translated, the, "Sabdung, Dormi, Gompa, Namdirmi", that's a little bit

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.200
 old,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:53.160
 but this has what it is. So this is now what Dokti teaches. Again, of course, many of you already,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.800
 you all know Dokti, but again, we all here together, and I'm going to tell a little bit Dokti

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:08.200
 my understanding, so I will talk again to you Dokti. Generally, where Dokti comes from,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:16.920
 who taught these Dokti teachings? Generally, according Buddhism, Dokti teaching is taught by

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:23.240
 the Buddha Shakyamuni. And when he taught, and where he taught this,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:30.360
 Buddha gave that teachings, generally, when he was in India,

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:39.800
 India, and that means when? Two thousand, about 600 years ago, the Buddha gave the Dokti teachings.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:48.200
 And where he gave these teachings? He gave these teachings in a known as Pure Land Akanishad.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:56.840
 Pure Land Akanishad. Also, Buddha gave this Dokti teaching. He does not give Dokti teaching,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:05.000
 and his regular form that we see on the statues, one face, two arms, two legs, and

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:12.920
 holding with the arms, balls. It's not. And the teachings, he gave this teaching in the form of

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:23.000
 a Buddha Samhana Badras. Buddha Samhana Badras. And to whom we give teachings? And all the great

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.600
 lineage masters, who are there? The lineage master of the mind-to-mind transmission lineages.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:38.520
 Linear master of the symbolic transmission lineages. And what that means? Of course, you

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:47.960
 all know. It means they are not just like regular practitioners. They are highly enlightened

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:54.920
 practitioners, relative beings. They grade with their dharas, and their buddhas,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:02.280
 male and female buddhas. How he gave this teaching? According to the teaching,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:16.920
 he gave beyond the world and the symbol. Beyond the world. W-O-R-D. And the symbols. He gave.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:26.440
 And how that happened? He said Buddha, relaxed in the meditation, or Buddha, not, I'm sure,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.680
 shouldn't use relaxed. Buddha is absolute state of the true nature of the Dharmakaya,

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:42.120
 within that natural status. But where is the display? Merged from him, and came from him,

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:51.640
 and merged to all this. All this audience. So what they received? They received everything

00:21:51.640 --> 00:22:00.600
 what Buddha Samyantabad has. All the resists. Same time, Buddha Samyantabad did not lost anything.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:10.520
 So it's completely received that. So even sometimes in teaching said, the Buddha gave that teaching

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:20.520
 from the unborn natural status. Unborn natural status. So that's how he received that teaching.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.840
 Teachings. Generally, great teacher, Buddha Sakyamuni, when he came this world,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:39.960
 from age 35 onwards, until age 81, he gave variety of teachings. All those teachings.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:47.000
 The ultimate teaching is known as Dzhokhi teachings. So he gave that teachings to the

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.240
 Selenciyaramas, or Akanishad, or in the Tibet, is known as women. And so he gave those teachings

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:03.880
 in there. And that will then continually carried and spread out all that teachings carried.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.880
 How this teaching came to the human world. According again to Dzhokhi teaching,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:18.280
 and so now Buddha Samyantabad, or Buddha Sakyamuni, transferred those teachings

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:25.480
 to all the five Dhyana Buddhas, and all those Buddhas. And then Rajasathos

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:34.200
 transmitted this to the Garab Dorjis. Garab Dorjis. And Garab Dorjis is the first

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:42.680
 human Dzhokhi teacher who brought this teaching to this world. How Rajasathos transferred,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:49.720
 in the teaching said, he transferred teaching through the symbolic lineage task techniques.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:57.400
 Not necessarily word and speaking this, but through the sign and the symbols. He taught

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:04.280
 these teachings. And Garab Dorjis received completely everything. At the same time, Garab Dorjis

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:12.760
 reached enlightenment, become the Buddhas. From Garab Dorjis, they continually carried.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:19.080
 And that is how according teaching, and then it teaches the oral transmission lineages,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.720
 continually. Oral transmission lineages. Lineages, so that means Garab Dorjis,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.720
 one who hold the mind teaching, so the mind-to-mind transmission lineage, symbolic transmission

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.520
 lineage,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:39.240
 and oral transmission lineage. And then now he transferred his foremost students to the

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:49.240
 Manjushri Mathur, on Jambakini's receipt. Jambakini also reached enlightenment, and he

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:57.000
 shared these teachings to his foremost students, which is known as hiri-san.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.880
 Now, oral transmission lineage. And hiri-san I shared, and of course it didn't mean that you

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.240
 don't have the symbolic transmission lineage and mind transmission lineage, that all has now

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.840
 sharing that. And hiri-san I shared this teaching to them. Then

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:25.480
 Ramal Mathur, Gaurab Rama Sambama, and Jana Sutras, those great Dokki masters. Those are in a way

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.880
 highlight the single lineages. But according to teaching, they have also many other students too.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:39.560
 But that's the Dokki teaching being as single lineages until hiri-san. Hiri-san shared this

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:47.400
 teaching to the three great masters, as I said, Gaurab Rama Sambama, Ramal Mathur, and Jana Sutras.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:55.240
 Three masters. And so, Jana Sutras also shared this teaching again to Ramal Mathur. So,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:02.840
 Ramal Mathur becomes as the disciples of the hiri-san, as well as Jana Sutras. So, it's that.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:12.120
 This great, so how this teaching, Dokki teaching came to debate is bought by the three great

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:20.840
 masters. Those are post in Gaurab Rama Sambama, and the second is, then, Ramal Mathur, and the

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.400
 third

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:30.520
 is great debate in task later. They bought these teachings. So, that is really how this teaching.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:37.720
 And from that on, then it continues. And in Nyingma, particularly in Nyingma Suku, there is two

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:37.720
 major

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:45.240
 lineages. Those are known as Kama lineages and Therma lineages. So, those two major lineages

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:54.040
 continually preserve this teaching and carried, until now, continually ongoing non-stop or unbroken

00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:02.520
 lineages of this teaching. So, that is really about how this teaching came and how that exists now.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:11.000
 Now, we go to this one. So, that's really our view of the Dokki, and of course, we can talk

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.720
 that more those things continue in this.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:25.400
 Now, here, as I said, the title of this teaching, and generally, and always in the teaching said

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:32.440
 that this text, the whole, the entire Mahananda teaching can be divided into three kind of sections

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.440
.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.880
 Three sections. So, those are like title and teaching and the color forms. Those are the common

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:45.320
 debating kind of with the structures that way. So, this again, if we do that way, that's it.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:55.960
 Title, teaching and color forms. Now, of course, we go to this title. According to Buddha teaching,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:05.160
 title is really very important. Title tells the summary of the teaching, of the big teaching,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.440
 whatever that is. It really tells that. So, therefore, this title captures the condensed

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:20.680
 meaning of the teaching, of this teaching. Many times in the teachings, those are

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:27.640
 very intelligent, smart, highly capable practitioners. The moment they read the title,

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:35.400
 that moment they understand pretty much meaning of the entire books or the teachings, that's it.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.200
 So, therefore, that's what I said. The teaching is so important in many ways, I mean that.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:47.800
 And now, we go this way. The first one is here, said, and in it read, it says, "Sabdung surmi

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.600
 gumba namjane" and here we see the essential point of the effortless profound meditations.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:03.160
 So, if we say the profound, profound, and in it read is "sabdung," profound,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:12.280
 or profound meaning, and we have translated that, "sabdung." What is a "sab" actually?

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:19.480
 Or profound. What means profound? Profound is, generally, anything is profound.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:27.720
 Anything is a profound. That's the terminology, profound. But this time, it's referring,

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:36.760
 profound, it's the "zokchin." It's zokchin, it's profound. What is zokchin? As I said earlier,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:49.230
 zokchin is not outside. Zokchin is within. And what that means within? Zokchin is our own awareness

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.400
.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:30:01.400
 Our own awareness is zokchin. Zokchin. Why is it called profound? Because

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:13.480
 do we see, or do I see, or do you see the drift of your mind, the edge of our mind,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:25.400
 about the mind? You see. We all have the mind, but really do we see anything about this mind

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:36.680
 profound, drift, drift of that, and the size of the mind? No. There is no answer. Therefore,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:44.840
 it is profound. This profound nature is the awakening nature,

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:56.760
 is ordinary nature. It is, what I said, zokchin. In it a bit, zokwa cembu, zokwa cembu. So this

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:05.560
 profound is zokwa cembu. What means zokwa cembu? This is how a great master, first in Cinci,

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:15.640
 great in Cinci, explained in his teachings. Zok means, the profound means, the vastness

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:26.280
 space of the true nature of dharmatam, which has no boundary, no depth, no edge, no center.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:36.360
 That vastness call it. Within that vastness call is, what is completed? What ever again,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.200
 that zokchin, zok every time, pray as the meaning of the completed. What is completed?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.560
 That everything is completed. Within that vastness of the vastness performed,

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:57.640
 that nature or dharmadhatu status. What means everything? All the phenomena,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:10.040
 poem, sound, space, touch, test, or many times in the teaching said, all the samsara phenomena,

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:18.520
 all the nirvana phenomena, path to the nirvana, or the between nirvana and samsara, what in

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.400
 Buddhism

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 called path phenomena. P-A-T-H, path phenomena. So that means all the phenomena, three phenomena,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:35.560
 are completed within the zokchin. Within the zok, zok means everything is completed.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:44.520
 How complete it? It's not something big, zokchin, bag, B-A-G, bag, and put all those things inside.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:52.600
 No, not like that. Not like that. Everything, every those three phenomena,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:33:01.720
 samsara phenomena, nirvana phenomena, path phenomena, all that phenomena,

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:13.560
 never separated from that profound nature. Never separated. That means what? The identical,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:25.640
 identical. Nothing, no, there's no any phenomena. It's not pervaded by this vastness.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:33.320
 It's the same nature. For that reason, the great teacher Buddha said, as we take often their

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:40.200
 quotations, pranghar suttara, poem is emptiness. Emptiness of home.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:51.480
 Emptiness of home. That union is not negations. It's not just one side. It's not extreme.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.080
 It's totally blended in, perfectly, beautifully. Because of that harmonized nature,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:09.560
 then everything can be arising. So beautiful. Magical display. That's what the great teacher

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:16.360
 Buddha Shakyamuni and the Buddha teach him, the interdependent coordination, the interdependent

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:25.800
 arising, that interconnected arising. All connections. Sometimes also here say the connection,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:34.840
 connections is true. Conditions, conditions. All that things arises. Where they think the arising

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:42.920
 is also magical. There's no substantial, social, structural, existing, solid existing.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:53.720
 Moment it appears, that moment is empty. Empty is appeared, that's what. So these are all these

00:34:53.720 --> 00:35:01.560
 phenomena existing, three phenomena in the teaching set, are completed within these great

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:09.400
 profoundness sets. So then, in what the great master first changes said, zho kwa cembu. He

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.720
 used three words. That's very interesting. I'm a very profound teacher, really. And I thought,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:25.160
 the pa means what? It's one's own awareness. Pa, rukba. Rukba. Where that who understands

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:35.080
 that? Where is that actually? For each individualist. Where is this whole phenomena of the samsara?

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.440
 Where is all phenomena of the nirvana? Where is the phenomena of all that path?

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:50.760
 Where is that? It's all within the rukba. Who's going to perceive? Who's going to experience?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:59.320
 Who's going to follow? Who's going to be activating that? No other than the rukba.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.000
 Then how that rukba is, in the Dokki teaching set, is already enlightened. And of course,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.600
 I'll explain in later too. Already enlightened. What that means? But in Mahayana teaching,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:22.040
 always the enlightenment is three kayas. So rukba is already in three kaya sets.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:30.920
 And that is the older nature, the three kayas, or three wisdom slaters.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:41.240
 And the wisdom of the emptiness, the wisdom of the clarity, the wisdom of the displace.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:50.600
 Even the teaching divided those three different ways. There's not three separate entities,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:59.960
 three different things. All is within. These three kayas or three wisdom, it's not just something

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:15.480
 newly developed, newly arises. It is already inherited. Already is here, here. So when we

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:25.640
 practice Dokki, what are we doing? The sense is already here. But we are purifying the cover-ups

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:35.800
 of this rukba. What cover? All is blocked. That is dualities. And also in the teaching called

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:46.120
 obscurations, defilements, those are, we are purifying. What process are we going to purify?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:54.360
 Those are then two merits. Two merits, accumulated merit versus two merits.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:03.080
 And we have to be practical. We have to be diligent. Why we have to be diligent? Because

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:13.480
 our habit pattern is completely take over us, our mind streams. In a way, it takes over completely.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:22.760
 When? A long time ago, according to the teaching, from the biggest times, it really takes over that

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:22.760
.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:29.880
 And not just only that, it takes over and that's it. But it added so many habitual patterns because

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.560
 our conceptions added, added. So now we are completely, according to the teaching, we are

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:43.160
 saturated within the habit patterns. We're completely saturated. Even the powerful teaching

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:50.760
 of the Dokkin, Dokkin, we need effort, joyful effort, and courage, and commitment, devotion,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:57.960
 and both each other. Those all needed. To keep up, to claim, and liberate, and transform whatever

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.160
 technique you use, we have to keep up that. So that's what really this, this, that is what

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:12.360
 the Dzokwa, Dzokwa, Dzokwa, and the path to separate with the expalant. Then God and Master

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:20.280
 first Jesus said, "Chimbu" means what? "Chimbu" is a debate of all, again, means great, great.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:29.080
 He said, because when you have the realization of the Rupa, there's nothing higher realization

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:37.480
 than that. There's nothing higher realization. When you discover your own authentic Rupa,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:44.280
 Rupa or the ordinary awareness, there's nothing else higher realization than there is.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.120
 Even the Buddhas and Bodhisattva came to tell you that is not high. There's nothing really higher

00:39:52.120 --> 00:40:00.040
 more than that. This is completely the highest levels of realization. So that is what Dzokkin,

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:08.600
 Dzokkin is, Dzokwa, Chimbu. So that is performed. This is the profound teaching,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:14.200
 profound. Then, so that is, and then in the debate here, in the debate, there is

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:21.480
 "don", "sabdons", that profound meanings, if I go over this, profound meanings.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:27.720
 And the profound meanings, what meanings? That means when you have this realization of the

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:37.080
 discovery of our profound Dzokkin nature, nature, then what? There's two purpose or two

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:43.160
 benefits that are completed to benefit. According to Buddha teaching, always in the teaching is

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:51.240
 fulfilling the two goals, fulfilling the two purposes. That means fulfilling the goal of

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.840
 one's own and fulfilling the goal of others. Why is so important in a Buddha's teaching or

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.800
 particularly Mahayana teaching or the Vaidhyana teaching? Because of the Bodhisattva. To benefit

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.720
 help between the others is Bodhisattva. Once you develop the Bodhisattva, whenever we develop the

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:18.600
 Bodhisattva, it's not just ended when you become the Buddhahood. When you reach enlightenment,

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:28.040
 then the true beneficial activity for all living beings are started. And how that started?

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:35.960
 In the teaching said that whenever you know, in the debate, the permanent, pervasive,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:42.360
 sub-continuous. Three ways you're going to continue to benefit for all living beings.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:48.440
 That means when you reach enlightenment or now I reach enlightenment or become the Buddha,

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:57.640
 I don't care. That's not. You are continually caring that Bodhisattva activities

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:04.200
 until every living beings are completely reached enlightenment. For those reasons,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.760
 that's what's called permanent. Permanent, we can translate as continuation too.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:18.920
 Continuation, pervasive, and sub-continuous. That means without any effort.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:27.320
 Bodhisattva's enlightenment beneficial activity needs no effort. Not struggling, not forcing,

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:34.600
 not dragging. It's simultaneously arising as it needed in order to benefit for all living beings.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:42.520
 So that is what. And then also it means, tone means, means temporarily benefit,

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.980
 bring joy, peace, happiness to ourselves and help to the other beings and fulfilling the goal of

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.080
 the

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.680
 Bodhisattva or fulfilling the goal of six parameters actively involving that.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:03.160
 And now, next one is, here's the effortless. Effortless is generally in the Dzokhi teaching.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:10.520
 Dzokhi teachings are named as effortless yana, yana of effortless. There's another

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:18.520
 se-no-nyam, sur-mi-ki-te-pa in Tibet. Sur-mi-ki-te-pa means tupa or yana of no efforts.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:28.120
 That indicated that all the other yanas need effort, but Dzokhi don't need effort

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:37.400
 in the teaching. For that reason, se-no-nyam of Dzokhi is sur-mi-ki-te-pa or effortless yanas.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:43.960
 And that is what all yana means, of course you all know, but I will list the names of those yanas.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:51.400
 Grecian teacher, Bodhisattva came to give the teachings as a staircase,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:58.760
 first step, second step, third step, fourth step. So one after another he give those

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:06.600
 teachings as staircase. So that means the first step is the foundation of the second steps.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:15.480
 It's not something that is we have to neglect it or the unnecessary, no necessity. All is connected

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:15.480
.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:27.960
 First step is of course first. It can be easy to climb, to set up our feet, but it's so important,

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:34.600
 third and fourth and fifth, all that steps. So all that teaching. And those teachings,

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:42.200
 those steps, that yana teachings, what are known as those are the, then, that's in it.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:50.920
 Sharaka yana means, at the beginning, the Buddha's teachings, such as the

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:57.960
 poor, noble, truth teachings. Those are all the Sharaka teachings and as well as known as

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:04.280
 Parthika Buddha teaching or yanas. Sharaka yana, Parthika Buddha yana. I'm sure you all know that,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:11.960
 but if you don't know, I translated that. Sharaka means like listener and what you listened,

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:19.320
 and you're also explaining that to the others. Yana of the listening and explaining or pronouncing

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:25.640
 that exactly what you heard, that means not changing things, not changing or not alternating,

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.760
 not adding our own kind of ideas and all that, trying to make kind of editing things is not,

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:37.080
 it's just pronouncing exactly what you heard. From who? According to Buddhism, Buddha teaching,

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:43.080
 what you heard from the Buddha Shakta Muni and expounding that exactly to the others,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:49.720
 those who are interested. So those are known as Sharaka yanas. And the Parthika Buddha yana is

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:57.880
 individual yana of the individual enlightened beings. That means there are certain groups,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.600
 practitioners, they are very personal. They don't like to socialize too much, they like to be

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:09.820
 engaged in one's own places and just be like more hermitage style. So those are known as

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:10.600
 individually

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.600
 awakened Buddha, but which is the category belongs with connected with the Sharaka yanas,

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:22.040
 the first yanas according to the same. Similar, they are similar, even they have some slightly,

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.960
 I mean some degree of difference, realization, those are explaining. And after that, third one

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:34.840
 is the Bodhisattva yanas. That is Mahayana, then you all know Bodhisattva yana. And the fourth one

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:43.160
 is the, then from port and from port to this, until ninth is the Vaidhyana teachings, Vaidhyana.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:52.120
 And Vaidhyana is a diamond vehicles or yana is vehicles or lipped, one who lipped up that.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:00.920
 So diamond vehicles. And that is then the Shikarayana, Upayana, and Yogayana, you all

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:08.600
 heard that, know that. And then those are three outer tandras or yanas. And three inner tandrayanas

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:18.200
 are then Mahayoga, Anoyoga, and Atayoga. So this now Atayoga is a synonym of zukin and as well as,

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:26.040
 I'm saying effortless yanas, those all. And that means now all these Atayanas had the effort,

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:36.520
 but zukin is, has effortless. That's so, so is a synonym, synonyms. Why is also called,

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:44.520
 because of all those nine Atayanas, when it's compared to the zukin, they are, in a way,

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:52.200
 homopedic styles, homopedic styles, because the conception is displaying conceptions.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:59.400
 All conceptions are helping to the conceptions. And how? For example, in the teachings,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:08.760
 we use the examples. For example, in permanent conception, if you got understand what means

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:15.960
 in permanent when you when we got the realization that in permanent, it will help notion of the

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:25.120
 permanent. So that means permanent is the conception in permanent is a conception. But one is

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.000
 helping to

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.560
 take care of the other. So which is true about a conception? What is true? In permanent is true,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:44.680
 according Buddhism. Permanent is not true. It's not relevant. It's not realistic.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:52.200
 In permanent is truth. What the greatest teacher Buddha Shakyamuni teaching, he said,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:00.440
 he says truth, where things are. But I did not give any kind of like esoteric something that

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:08.920
 never exists. But I get what things are, where things are. For that reason, but as synonym,

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:16.360
 synonym of Buddha called truth, the speaker, truth, the speakers speak truth. What is this?

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:24.440
 And then Buddha is teaching, for example, for example, one thing, also egolessiness,

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:32.680
 egolessiness teaching, again, egolessiness is a conception. But that conception help me to the

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:44.760
 ego, cling it, cling it to the ego. And which is true? Then egolessiness is true. There is no egos

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:52.360
 according to Buddhism. There is no I. It didn't mean that we cannot use that terminology,

00:49:52.360 --> 00:50:02.920
 but there is no truth existing as we believe. Actually, there is nothing existing that truly

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:10.120
 exists at all. So that's the way, kind of, it's just that in the bodhijata, for example,

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:17.800
 it's a conception relative to the bodhijata I'm talking, it's conception. When that

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:26.360
 conception help to what? It helps or it's subdue, it's explained self-important conception,

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:36.440
 self-important conception, both the conception, but which is good. Bodhijata is good,

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:43.640
 because self-important, that cling it to our self, is all sorts of troubles in the samsara.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:51.080
 And we think really carefully, in the teachings said, but not just that, in carefully,

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:57.080
 and we started thinking one's own self too much. One important self-centered mind

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:04.200
 is a troublemaker. It's a troublemaker in the families, troublemaker among the groups,

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.040
 friends, troublemaker in the neighborhood or villages, it's troublemaker in the countries,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:17.560
 troublemaker in the large, self-centered, self-important, self-centered.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:28.920
 So if we like to have the happiness, peace, then bodhijata, the relative bodhijata, open heart,

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:35.080
 relaxed, calm, peaceful, if we bring more friends, more harmonious, more peaceful,

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:42.280
 more calm, peaceful, more friendships, we don't have, we have the really true bodhijata,

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:50.840
 we never have to feel lonely. We have so many friends, all have become, and become also more wise,

00:51:51.480 --> 00:52:00.680
 it's true, more smart, more sensible, more common sense. All those abundance of goodness

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:10.040
 will come. They are conceptions, but they are so good, really so good, it will benefit,

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:17.480
 benefit to me, to all the other beings. So those are, until that generally in the

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:23.160
 teaching, he said, until Dzogchen is a conception by helping to the conceptions.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:31.800
 By skill means by the Buddha, showed all those techniques, but everyone teaching is leading to

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:40.440
 the wondrous donations, to Dzogchen, to that Dzogchen which I explained as a great master

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:47.080
 postul chenze is leading. So that means the old Buddha's teaching, 84,000 teachings of Buddhas,

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:57.400
 is teaching all leading to discovering this, that our ordinary inherited nature of the Dzogchen,

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:07.480
 Dzogchen, or our inherited great awareness. So that is the general meaning of the Dzogchen.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.560
 And then Dzogchen teaching itself, just as a great master,

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:22.520
 master, kiri-sena, summarized Dzogchen teachings into three groups, not three groups. So

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:28.840
 kiri-sena summarized Dzogchen, that three sections of Dzogchen teaching, mind section of Dzogchen

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:35.160
 teaching, space section of Dzogchen teaching, pit instruction sections of the Dzogchen teaching,

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:42.520
 those three sections, Simde, Lungde, Mengade, and I'm sure many of you know already that also,

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:51.320
 those three, the great master, Shiri-sena, subdivided that third section of Mengade,

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:59.080
 Mengade, and those are subject, how much he made, four sections he did, he subdivided,

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:07.960
 or if we can't relate to distillizing of the teaching, so more kind of like essence to bring

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.560
 one's own self to get realizations, or get directly connected to the primordial our natures.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:19.880
 And that is, and those are the words in the teaching said outer sections, inner sections,

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:28.680
 secondary sections, most of the secondary sections, mostly secondary sections, in the turbid, and

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:28.920
 this

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:37.800
 is called, chaikor, nankor, samokor, yansin, lana, mebokor, so the essence, supreme essence

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:44.510
 sections teaching. This supreme essence section teaching, that is what we are practicing these days

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520
.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:51.400
 The old zoki teaching, that is really what we are, so that means even the zoki teaching,

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:57.480
 and all that zoki teaching, the mind section, space section, with instructions, we are boiled

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:04.040
 down to the to those great masters, this linear master, through their kindness, boiled down,

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:11.000
 we are really like prepared, they prepare us to connect to the, as the mostly inner most of the

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:21.160
 teachings, essence, essence. That practice, or that teaching, or that practices, is dividing the

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:28.600
 two that you all know. Those are known as gada tikkyu practices, and it's learned up togal

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.240
 practices.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:37.880
 Gada tikkyu, and it's learned up togal practices. All simple way to tell tikkyu practices,

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:44.630
 and toga practices. And of course, many of you all know, but again, I'm just reminded to each other

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.680
,

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:51.960
 and just in a way, to reactivate our all the knowledge, the teachings, and the tikkyu means

00:55:51.960 --> 00:56:01.240
 cutting thoroughly, or instantly cutting, without the cuttle, and what to cut, what's called beyond

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:08.520
 the subject, object activities. If I use simple knowledge, simple language, cut that instantly.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:19.000
 What the cuts? Cut all the dualities, duality instantly, or in other words,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.040
 obscurations, or in other words, the completely clinging, grasping, cut instantly.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:38.760
 Without cuttle, that cuts, and all subject, and object, and activities. That is tikkyu.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:49.320
 And togal practices is translated many times, leaping over, leaping over instantly,

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:56.520
 from samsara to the enlightenment status, instantly. So those are known togal practices,

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:04.600
 togal practices. So this is kada tikkyu and toga practice. This, again, in the teaching,

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:11.880
 in the teaching said, kada tikkyu practice, tikkyu practice is effortless practices.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:22.280
 Practice of the effortless, don't need effort, practices. And toga practice is with effort.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:30.600
 Both are dukki practices. What is the difference between these two? We're going to really highlight

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:41.800
 that. The tikkyu is more focused to the emptiness aspect of the rukba, on its own awareness. That

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.040
 is

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:51.800
 tikkyu practices. Toga is more highlighted or focused to the clarity aspect of the

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:58.120
 nature of the rukba. That is the difference. Otherwise, both are both status. There are no

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:07.880
 separations, no separations, or no divisions. Both are the same. So now, tikkyu practice

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:18.200
 is many times in the teaching said, effortless practices. Why? Because once you receive the

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:25.240
 teaching, once you got the understanding of the recognizing our own awareness of the rukba,

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:32.200
 then there's no need, any effort. Effort is hindrance.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:45.000
 Effort is the dualities. Effort is the publications. Therefore, what in the teaching said, relax.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:56.680
 Be in that status. And we don't distract it. Why is it distracted? Because the distraction

00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:05.160
 is the dualities. If carried by that, so then, again, we are not in the natural status.

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:16.600
 Therefore, don't be what's called mindfulness. Be aware. Be aware. Effort. And relax that.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:24.280
 Throw the whole different way to abiding those teaching said. And so, you relax.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:32.360
 Then why is the teaching both the same, but why? Toga teachings are named with effort.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:40.840
 Because toga teaching, as many of you received teaching, you practice it. Those are known as

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:48.760
 always explaining, explaining of the three postures when you do the toga practices.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:58.360
 Three ways to gaze. Three ways to gaze. Three ways for station. Three ways to gaze. And three ways

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:08.200
 to essentials of the object and eye and awareness and wind. Those, many times,

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.160
 if you highlight, you have to focus those things. So therefore, it's known as effort.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:24.760
 You need effort. But reality is also effortless to compare with all the others. It is instantly

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:32.280
 zoki teaching is connecting to the ordinary, primordial nature. The ordinary raka, precious

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.480
 raka, is really connecting to that without any delays or without any kind of gap. Instantly,

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:48.200
 you connect with the ordinary nature. For that reason, zokin is known as then the yana of the

01:00:53.320 --> 01:01:01.080
 result, or yana of the wisdom. For those reasons, thinking only on that, that, kind of thinking on

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:08.840
 that, great master Sajya Pandita in the teaching said, and how zokin can be yana, because it is

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:15.160
 versatile. How can be yana? Because yana means, yana is a Sanskrit word which means

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:22.280
 lifter, one who's lifting up or many times translated as weaker from one place to the other

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:31.400
 place, lifting out. But zokin is already in that wisdom status. Why is it known as yana?

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.480
 That is it. That was it. Because of this instantly connecting to this primordial

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:48.120
 wisdom without any powers or stopping. That is what really is called effortless meditation.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:02:03.880
 The next one is the essential point of the effortless performed meditation,

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:10.600
 meditation, and then translated here. This maybe didn't translate exactly. Namjir means

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:20.840
 what's called? Namjir means yogi. Yogi or namjir means also what actually means yogi.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:29.720
 I think many of you know yoga. Yogi is a practitioner and yoga means what actually?

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:40.840
 Yoga means being in nature or being in nature as nature is. I think that's it. And it's very

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:53.800
 translated, namjir. Namjir means one is mastering or capturing the way that nature is. That is

01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:02.360
 really the yogi, also yoga. And yogi means the one who's doing that. So this means one could

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:10.520
 practicing without effort and discovering our ultimate goal of the of the rukba as is our

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:18.680
 ultimate nature of the rukba. It is essential to reach enlightenment within this lifetime

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:28.040
 and to verify all the habits and observations. That is essential. There's nothing more essential

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:36.360
 than that in this sense. Why this is essential? Because whatever we developed with our rukba,

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:45.800
 we're going to continue to enjoy and reach enlightenment for all the time. It's not

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:52.200
 something that we're going to leave behind or going to change. It is really the essential.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:04:00.360
 Essential of this lifetime, essential of the bardo, and essential in the next lifetime.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:08.440
 It's all the time. It's excellent, essential. So that is what this teaching is going to explain

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:16.200
 of this teach. So that is really my meaning of this title. And now we go to the to the

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.920
 the homage. And now it's actually divided in the according to it and what's called this name.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:35.400
 The teaching is divided into the title, teaching, and then colophones. So that we went

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:42.120
 briefly about the colophones. Now we go to teaching. Teaching is also many times divided

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:50.600
 in different sections, many kind of subdivisions. But this time we go to like kind of a truth.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:57.400
 And so that is the first, the homage. And then second is the teaching itself. You go to it. And

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:05.240
 then, so that's what it is. The now homage is here. The great master Mohoramud said, "Homage

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:14.440
 to Gharap and Masambhava." So that's it. So that's it. I think you all know. So I don't have to use

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:23.640
 so many of my broken language to explain. So that's it. Homage to Gharap and Masambhava. By who?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:30.920
 That we all, all the practitioners, everyone who is reading these books will participate. And then,

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:38.680
 of course, Gharap and Masambhava is the object of rafu all the time by all means by everyone. So

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:45.320
 therefore really we pay homage. So now I go over this. Again, we all know Gharap and Masambhava.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.800
 Gharap and Masambhava is the Buddha of the generations. Gharap and Masambhava is totally

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:58.840
 enlightened beings, both at a relative level and absolute levels. And what the great master

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:07.800
 Jangmukundra said in one of his Thelma teachings. He said, "You who," to Sanjukund, "you who hold

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:14.760
 all the, all the activity of the, all the Buddhas of three times," to Sanjukund.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:24.440
 "And you performed all the activities of the Buddhas in Bodhisattvas of all the times."

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:30.360
 And you want to hear, "You also ruled all the pure land of three caayas,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:38.680
 pure land of the dharmakaya, and pure land of the sambhokaya, and pure land of the narmakaya.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.920
 You rules, ruled all that." Who is that? That is Gharap and Masambhava.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:55.160
 So therefore, you are the Lord of all the families of the Buddhas.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:04.440
 For that I postulate it. This is what it is. Gharap and Masambhava is not just one single

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:13.000
 object, one single lama. Gharap and Masambhava is the regent of all the Buddhas and all the

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.760
 enlightenment beings of the past, and as well as in the futures, and as well as in ours.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:27.480
 So Buddhas of the Bodhisattvas, all the Vidyadharas, enlightened beings of the past,

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:35.000
 present, and future, represented of that. And a protector of all the beings, every living being.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.280
 According to Gharap and Masambhava's teachings, in the life story they're reading by Yisin Thodyam,

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:47.080
 in the life, in the liberation of Gharap and Masambhava, every six frames there is so many

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.600
 emanations of Gharap and Masambhava helping the supporters. Gharap and Masambhava is beyond the

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:59.960
 death and the birth, totally enlightened beings. Gharap and Masambhava is, came in the form,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:09.400
 Amitabha, of the, in the human or in the way, in this world, world to protect and help to all the

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:17.800
 beings, and particularly the generation of times. And Gharap and Masambhava is reincarnation of the

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:25.560
 Buddhashyakya Munis. Also, that what Buddhashyakya Munis said in the Sutturis, and Ananda, and as

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:32.760
 well as all the disciples, he should not get upset that I'm entering Mahaparinaranas, but I will be

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:40.440
 back at this, known as Gharap and Masambhava, even better than me, he said. There's nothing is

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:40.760
 better

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:48.130
 than Buddhashyakya Muni, but Buddhashyakya Muni like to highlight of his reincarnation of

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.160
 manifestations,

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:56.120
 manifestations. Many cases also said, because what is that mean? Gharap and Masambhava, where he

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:02.760
 appeared in this world as instantly rebirth, miracle is a birth, in the middle of a lot of

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:11.480
 as eight-year boys. And also, then Gharap and Masambhava is beyond death, because transcendental

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:18.440
 Western Rambo body. Therefore, in the, Buddha also mentioned, why? Because the Buddha was born,

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:24.120
 and the Buddha was in a way left, even though there is no really, you know, livings that, but

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:30.840
 Buddha left, left. But Gharap and Masambhava is beyond. And then Gharap and Masambhava is

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:37.480
 great Buddhas of all the Vajrayana practitioners, Buddha of all the times. In a debate, all the

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:43.160
 different schools, we have Buddhist schools, but those great masters, most of those great masters,

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:49.160
 we read the books of their, their books, always mentioning, they received the blessings of Gharap

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.970
 and Masambhava, either in the dream, or in a vision, or in the direct perceptions, really, all that

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:55.320
.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.680
 It's not just, I'm making up this, you can read life stories with this, this, that's, it's not

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:07.640
 just a kind of selected, occupied by the Numa practitioners. It's Buddha, it's Buddha for all,

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.840
 everyone's, everyone. And then Gharap and Masambhava is the Buddha of these generations,

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.080
 right now. All the different troubles, difficulties arise, according to teaching,

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.660
 and according to great masters, really now. And in the teaching, say that among all the male Budd

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:24.840
has,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:32.120
 Gharap and Masambhava is swept in the Buddha of the Degeneration. Among all the female Buddhas,

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:41.160
 Dara is the most powerful and swept and Buddha of the Degeneration times. So that's what this

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:47.320
 Gharap and Masambhava is. So therefore, because, and know the value of the importance of this,

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:56.460
 by great masters of how it is, then he pays homage. Lama Bhema Yunele Samsala. So that is just one

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:56.520
 way,

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:03.230
 understand. And now the second way, kind of explain him, if I go word by word with this, this, this

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:03.240
,

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:10.600
 again in Tibet, he said, Lama Bhema Yunele Samsala. That means, if he translated this,

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.000
 homage to, oh yeah, he's already translated, homage to Gharap and Masambhava. So Guru is

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:25.080
 intubated oscillator, or intubated word is called Lama. And then Bhema Yunele is Bhema Sambhava,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:31.880
 and homage is then to Sangachal. So that is exactly translated here.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:40.600
 What Lama means in intubated word, and of course you all know, Lama means, Lama is a Sanskrit word,

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:47.960
 Lama is Sanskrit word, Guru is translated as Lama. And always in the teaching he said,

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:59.240
 it has two meanings, higher one, and big callers, big callers, or heavy, heavy, dense, dense and

01:11:59.240 --> 01:11:59.720
 higher,

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:09.240
 higher, and higher means what? In Bhruli, higher means one who's highly religious human beings,

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:19.080
 higher, higher than one's own self. What sense higher? More knowledge, more understanding of

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:26.040
 the teachings, more loving kindness, more compassion, more maybe practices, more experience,

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:35.000
 those sense higher. It's higher, higher than my self. And then what is this? Again,

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.760
 density means density of the, this is the metaphor, of course, density of the realizations,

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:52.200
 realizations in the qualities are dense. What qualities, qualities or knowledge,

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.720
 and we call it or knowledge, call it or knowledge. What qualities? In Buddhism, always teaching

01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.240
 said

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:08.120
 long qiu, top qiu, call it of the knowledge of all the scriptures of Buddha teaching,

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:16.600
 and a realization of all that teachings, teaching what explaining, what those explaining,

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:23.640
 the old Buddha teaching, that all know, samurai, again, samurai is three extra-only trainings,

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:31.560
 extra-only the practice of the morality, extra-only the practice of the concentration, extra-only

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:31.640
 the

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:41.630
 practice of the verse terms. So that realization, three extra-only realizations that individual has

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640
.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:48.520
 But then Gharipayama sambhava is way beyond his total enlightenings. So his full verse terms,

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:58.200
 poor realizations, realizations, generally talking about llamas. Llama means also if we translated

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:05.640
 that into English, Gharip means teacher. In teaching in Buddhism, of course, teacher is so

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:13.160
 important. Teacher is so important, and he says that when you have the, with all the teachers,

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.240
 there is no realization will come. Even in the Buddha teaching said, all the Buddhas of 1000,

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:27.240
 1000 Buddhas are always contrary with Buddhas, teachers. One thousand Buddhas who are going to

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:33.320
 come, some came, some going to, more than going to come, but they all had teachers.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.520
 Without teacher, there is no Buddhas. This is true, everything, all really important,

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:46.520
 teachers are so important. Those teachings are then, as we can go maybe later over those things,

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:53.320
 but in a really, in a teaching, particularly in going about that teaching, there is six different

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.680
 teachers, six different teachers. I will list those, and many of you already know that,

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:07.480
 those six different teachers. First is general teachers. Second is then Dharma teachers. Third

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:15.320
 is then one who give the empowerment and the transmissions. And the fourth is one who give the,

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:25.080
 also, also what's called this, or support and the guiding of our continual practice, Samayas,

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:32.920
 Samayas. And the fourth, the fifth is one who's explaining the teachings, Sottara and Dandaras.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.600
 And then sixth one is who bring the instructions. This is, of course, there's six different

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.720
 categories, the men, but it's the categories, but that could be even one teacher performing all

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:51.880
 those, all pre-teachers doing all that things. So those are the, like, categories of the teachers,

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:59.100
 the lama or the gurus, that. Then even they are, those are the categories, but they need

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.200
 qualifications,

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:06.520
 qualities. Those qualities are explained by the Buddha teachings. Buddha teachings,

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:14.280
 teachings in, in a, in a Sottara or in a, in a Theravada or in Vinaya teaching,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:21.490
 and as well as bodhisattva yanas, and as well as vedayana teachings. So those all need

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:21.960
 qualifications.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:28.440
 Once you have these qualifications, great masters, then really it's a current teaching that is then

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:28.600
,

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:36.040
 if you are truly secure of the spiritual, of looking to the practitioner, that is just truly

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:42.440
 rewarding to our practices. Then that's so important and it's so good. And we can go over

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.880
 those things later too. Thanks more. Thank you very much everyone again for your participation.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.120
 Thank you everyone. Okay. Thank you. I started. Thank you. We do first minute meditation and then

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.840
 We dedicate, a short dedication. Thank you. Thank you everyone again.
