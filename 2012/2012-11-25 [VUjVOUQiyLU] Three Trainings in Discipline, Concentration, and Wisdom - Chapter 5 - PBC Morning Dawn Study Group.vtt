00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 Hello, this is the fifth webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group at Padma Samye Ling,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.080
 and we'll be discussing today from Veneraokhenporo Rinpoches' book "The Buddhist Path, Chapter

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.800
 5", which is called "Training in Discipline, Concentration, and Wisdom". So then we'll

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.840
 just begin with opening prayers, and then we'll go into the discussion. Thanks.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padma Sambaba, which is the essential, extraordinary

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 view and doctrine of the early translation school. You keep light and spread by the light

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great temple, I pray at your lotus feet. In the palace of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 the oatman, Darmadattu, the essence of all the Buddhists of the three times, the one

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 who shows clearly the dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honor of old Ruth Guru,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 glorious Ruth teacher, precious one, dwelling on the lotus seed and the crown of my head.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Hold me with your great kindness, and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 So this chapter five is divided into three points. The first is discipline, and the second

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 is concentration, and then the third, wisdom. So quickly I'll go over the ribcage, like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 the overview of the chapter where they discuss the discipline. So they begin by saying that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 the nature of the mind is filled with limitless goodness qualities, but to fully reveal these

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 qualities, the Buddha taught the three trainings of discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And discipline is not like following orders. We're fully relating with our mind by taming

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 the negative limited habits of our body, speech, and mind. And this is the first step in revealing

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 the mind's goodness qualities. And then the best support for discipline is mindfulness,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 alertness, and conscientiousness. In our daily life as well as in our practice, we have to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 pay attention to what is happening if we expect to develop good results. So then we'll just

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 read this first topic.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 According to the Buddhist teachings, discipline is not like following orders or being forced

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 to do something. Discipline means to relate fully with your own mind. In order to uncover

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 our true nature, we need to discipline our body, we need to discipline our speech, and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 we need to discipline our mind. Discipline is the first stage of cleaning up and preparing

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 for further developments. It is like clearing the ground. If we want to erect a beautiful

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 building, we need to clear the surface first. That's page 27, second paragraph.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I had a question about discipline. That was the second paragraph on the page. If you look

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 down at the third paragraph on 27, there's one line in particular. Discipline should

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 be accompanied by mindfulness, careful attention, and joyful effort. I think it was either in

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 that paragraph or somewhere else in this chapter, they talked about how discipline is relating

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 fully with the mind. What's the way that discipline influences mindfulness? Because I think so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 often, particularly in a lot of books that are geared towards people who are very new,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 a lot of emphasis is put on mindfulness and the mindfulness practices. What is it that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 the discipline brings to the mindfulness that isn't already there within mindfulness practices?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 What's the way that it highlights it? It's kind of a practical question, I guess.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Maybe it has to do with how discipline, on this term sheet, it can be talked about in

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 terms of ethical conduct as shila, which is one definition of discipline as it's used

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 in these three trainings. Not only just mindfulness in general, but also really looking more at

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 our outer behavior. How are we interacting with others? In terms of our bodies, each

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and our mind being disciplined about our conduct.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 In the way of saying, rather than being mindful of robbing a bank, we're mindful of washing

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 the dishes. In that way, are you saying?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 I think so. But also, if you don't have a virtuous conduct, your mind becomes agitated,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 and therefore it's much harder to practice mindfulness. Say somebody who's like a bank

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 robber, they have a lot of worries and fears. So if your ethical conduct isn't in line,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 then you actually have a much more difficult time, or you couldn't practice mindfulness.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Exactly. Because our mind is so much influenced by our body and our speech, that if what

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 we do with our body and our speech is really rough, or based on these negative emotions,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 then it's going to increase the habit of our mind to be tight, have more grasping, have

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 these same negative emotions, be stronger. What mindfulness is doing is highlighting

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 in the present moment, what is my mind doing? Is it negative? Is it imbalanced or balanced?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I think a big part of mindfulness is that we see what our mind is doing in the present,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 and at the same time we see if that's tending to lead us towards more suffering, and we

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 experience that suffering in not a pleasant way, and then also mindfulness would see if

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 it's tending to make our mind more balanced, and then we experience how that is more free

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 from suffering, or more relaxed, more attentive to the details, more available to be interacting

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 with what's actually happening in this situation, different things.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So you're saying mindfulness would lend itself easily to discipline that?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 It seems to me that it's also a way of helping to define what is discipline.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 I definitely think mindfulness is a part to be remembering our intention, remembering,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 kind of looking at our motivation, our general goals, what's most appropriate with what's

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 actually right with us now, and always just keeping that atmosphere, that awareness of

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 our intention, whether it's actions of our body, actions of our speech, or just where

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 our mind or self is.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 It seems like there's a lot that makes up discipline, and that's part of our discussion

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 here, is what is discipline, and definitely it seems it entails mindfulness.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And then of course mindfulness and alertness and conscientiousness kind of seems like applies

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 to our concentration as well, but definitely has a place with watching our body, speech,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 and mind, because remembering our overall goal, and instructions, and promises, and so many.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Yeah, like Jungkong cultural, the first cultural, he wrote this giant vast treasury of knowledge,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 they call it, which includes one of the whole scopes of the Buddhist teaching.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 The first one, which was the root of the whole foundation and the backbone for everything

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 that came afterwards, and that was his intention to write, was a commentary on basically discipline

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.000
,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 the three vowels, and as they say, without discipline, you can't, well you can't really

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 progress at all, because you have, like I was saying, like everyone else was saying,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 normally we think of, I think discipline as like, I think it's helpful to think of,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 in some ways, as like where do we want to go, like what direction do we want to go in,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 if we want to go in like bank robber direction, then we shouldn't be disciplined

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 in certain ways, we should just do that, you know, we should do bank robber activities.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 If we want to go in the direction of like being more gentle, less agitated, less drama,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 you know, like more gratefulness, more awareness of like impermanence

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 and the fleeting aspect of everything, like also I think it's time to just recognizing

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 our present circumstances, and how lucky we are, and how special those circumstances are,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 because as they say, like the Buddha said, the thought of impermanence is like a whip to the horse,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 and that's like, that has to do with discipline in the sense that, here in Caesar's Echoes,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 they talk about discipline that rejects negative action, but also discipline that accepts positive

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 action.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So it's not just like, you know, like, I'm not going to do this, here's a big list of things

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 I can't do or shouldn't do or won't do, because that way you could be really encumbered, you know,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 but if you think of it as like, well here's where I want to go, I want to go down the Dharma path,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 I want to, you know, like realize these states, and then what helps me with that, you know,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.260
 like maintaining like a calm mind, calm body, calm speech, calm mind, you know, cultivating

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.000
 mindfulness,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 all those things together.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And maybe going off of that as well, there's another term that Rinpoche's were tying into this,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 again in that same paragraph I was referencing before, that third paragraph,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 they talk about not only the careful attention, which I think we've talked about here,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 but also the joyful effort, which I think for a lot of people, including myself,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 the link between joyful effort and discipline isn't always very apparent, particularly at first,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.640
 so I was wondering if people would talk a little bit about the connection of how to bring joyful

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.000
 effort

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.940
 into discipline and mindfulness, or, you know, how it might even just naturally be within that

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.000
 discipline.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Well I was just thinking about how, in that same paragraph again, this third paragraph,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 just talking about discipline as good planning, and it's really just like what you were saying,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 like if you think about it like, what do you do when you're going to plan an activity,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 like thinking about like what you're going to need along the way, so what's your destination,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.440
 and like, if you have that pretty clearly in mind, and it's, you know, in this case it's like

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.000
 following the Dharma,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 then it's like, what do you put in your basket? And you joyfully pack these like good, useful

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 things like mindfulness,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.420
 like, you know, whatever the ingredients I need, there's so many good ingredients, positive

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.000
 ingredients,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 and so in a way, to me, that's sort of how it seems like joyful effort is part of discipline,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 it's just like planning for a trip and you're excited and it's good, the destination's good,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 and put everything useful in that basket.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Do you have time for the level of appreciation then, or more?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.400
 Yeah, I mean, in some ways, and it's just like maybe the joyfulness of maintaining the awareness of

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.000
 the destination in a sense,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 and so because the discipline is to help us, is to help us go there, you know,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.160
 so in that sense it seems like joyful effort, so it's only going to help us get there quickly and

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.000
 with greater ease,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 so maybe others have something to say about that, but...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Just two, I mean, how basically, you know, the three with discipline is, like Andrew mentioned too,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.360
 is how we're really looking at the law of cause and effect and cause, conditions, results of

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.000
 suffering

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.370
 and its causes of cessation and, you know, natural liberation and the path to realizing that is the

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.000
 path,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 and part of that is seeing, well, with our body, speech, and mind,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 what are our activities of body, speech, and mind, you know, related to our suffering,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and how can we start to erode and wear down suffering for ourselves,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.590
 as well as the suffering we can create in auspicious conditions for ourselves and other beings in

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.000
 our connections,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 and we really can see to some degree our mistakes and recognize them and really see their results

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 to whatever degree we can,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.470
 I think we naturally don't enjoy seeing them at all, and then likewise the more we see our virtuous

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.000
 qualities

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 and the virtuous qualities of others and virtuous activities of body, speech, and mind,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 where, you know, there's less ignorance, where there's less aversion and anger and hatred,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.330
 where there's less, you know, attachment and jealousy and doubt and hesitation, just all these, you

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.000
 know,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 especially if we look at the three main poisons, you know, anger, attachment, you know, ignorance,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 and then how they relate, so just two, so the cause is two for realizing more, you know, beneficial

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 and positive

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 and healing, nurturing, balancing activities we can do with our body, and, you know,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 that are not only for ourselves but others, you know, through all the paramitas and so many levels

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 and things,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and then likewise with our speech to, like, have meaningful, kind, uplifting speeches,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.320
 I mean, again, we kind of naturally can reflect on that and see, to some degree, see how that's

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.000
 nice, you know,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.620
 and then likewise the more, kind of, to whatever degree we can see more clearly and think more

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.000
 clearly

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.720
 and have an open mind and heart, you know, than that too, so I think the way joyful effort reflects

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.000
 too

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 and we can really have some degree of seeing, oh, you know, this is going to, I can see how this is

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 nice

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and natural and more balancing and I want to engage with this more, you know, and then likewise,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 oh, this doesn't, this isn't good, you know, this doesn't taste good, this, like, I'm not happy,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 others aren't happy,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 it's causing such a mess, like, you know, so just that balance of being more aware of body, speech

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 and mind,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 lessening that, you know, negative activities and states of mind as well as positive things,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 I mean, just the way joyful effort reflects to that when we can really see and engage that way,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.110
 how discipline, again, Rinpoche has talked here, it's not about an outer, you know, police force or

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.000
 getting too tight,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.250
 but really what's bringing more balance to our body, speech and mind and what's not only for

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.000
 ourselves,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 but other people and the environment and the world.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Just a quick question, I don't know how much time you have on this topic, but do you all think that

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 discipline could be also,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 like, you could talk about it in terms of renunciation and/or is that maybe only a piece of it?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.400
 Like, you know, I was just thinking, like, with this definition from the Ceaseless Echoes about

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.000
 being, you know,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 rejecting negativity but then also accepting positive actions and then the third benefitting beings

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.000
,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.910
 I mean, in some ways I feel like from what I understand of renunciation that that is all of those

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.000
 three things,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 maybe highlighting the rejecting negative, but how do you think renunciation fits in?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.450
 I think particularly a lot of what Laya was just saying, it kept sparking my mind back to the four

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.000
 thoughts that turned the mind,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.730
 a lot of that reflecting on not only the present circumstances but also what brought about those

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.000
 present circumstances

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.210
 and what was in those causes that created the peaceful or the joyful pieces of what's in our

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.000
 current circumstances

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.830
 but also at that same time what created the disharmonious and the suffering qualities of what's in

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.000
 the present moment.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.440
 So I think, yeah, I agree, there's definitely a very close relation and particularly what Laya was

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.000
 talking about,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 that having that reflection on that really creates a lot of that joyful effort.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 We're renouncing the causes of our suffering and the causes of other people's suffering

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 and then we're accepting the causes of our happiness and other people's happiness.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I mean, so definitely in that way, as for enunciation, it totally leads us to the path of Dharma,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 that good activities lead to positive states of mind, that in a larger sense it reveals the natural

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 goodness qualities that are in our mind.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 So it's connecting more directly with how our mind is when it's balanced or our primordial wisdom.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.370
 And then definitely in the context of joyful effort, I thought to mention, in addition to what Laya

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.000
 was saying,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 more in the Mahayana context of seeing joyful effort and discipline as the Paramitas,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 as the second Paramita and the fourth Paramita,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 that that joy largely comes from really being more and more and more concerned about other beings.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.840
 I think really that larger context, like Shanti Deva's famous for saying that all suffering comes

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.000
 from desiring one's own happiness

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 and all happiness comes from desiring the happiness of others.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 It's that ego clinging when it's only about us and our little box of concerns that really causes,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 that it really squeezes out the joy that we can experience.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.370
 It's really being more concerned, more pervasively concerned about ourselves and others in this

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.000
 larger view,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 in a longer term view, that joy is really there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 I have a question, not to any particular one of these topics, but in general with the whole.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Because when you're talking about the Mahayana aspect of these, I was curious,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 what framework do you believe that Rinpoche's were discussing these points in?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.530
 Because they didn't use a lot of vocabulary that would designate which particular yana it was a

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.000
 part of.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 I think particularly as we brought into the concepts and terms that we're talking about,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.320
 particularly looking at the Noble Eightfold Path, do you find it useful to bring in that Mahayana

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.000
 aspect

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 when we're discussing these, and of course you do because you just said,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.020
 "How else could we look at these different points in the Mahayana view to bring out some more of

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.000
 the meaning?"

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.140
 I know during this past month-long retreat when Kevin Rinpoche was talking about the union of Maham

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.000
udranzochen,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 he says in the Mahayana context they don't talk so much about the Noble Eightfold Path

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.330
 because they do talk a lot about the three trainings, the training morality, concentration, and

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.000
 wisdom,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 which are the essence of the Noble Eightfold Path.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 They're really the same because seeing the six Parmitas as being these three trainings,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.150
 it actually includes all of the Noble Eightfold Path in a larger view of being concerned about all

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.000
 beings everywhere,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 like it is in a larger context.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Talking about the three trainings is both the so-called Hinayana and the Mahayana discussion.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.990
 It's essential as the Noble Eightfold Path, it's the fourth Noble Truth, which is a core teaching

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.000
 of Buddha in the first turning,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 and that Hinayana teachings.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And then the six Parmitas, like the three trainings, can be said to be the six Parmitas,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 and most of them is encompassing all six Parmitas.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 While you were explaining that, I was thinking about that as well.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 I mean, you can even relate them directly if you want to, just particular Parmitas.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 But it is really kind of fascinating how they really do line up.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.160
 If you look at them side by side, it's very easy to see, "Oh yeah, it's just a different way of

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.000
 explaining this really beautiful teaching."

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 And they talk about primordial wisdom in the chapter in several parts.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 And primordial wisdom is generally Vajrayana, Yivu, or the Ati Zochen view.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.890
 It's primordial, it's not actually samsara, it isn't the actual nature, the nature is wisdom from

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.000
 the beginning.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 It's a prior teaching.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.200
 I thought maybe it's good, just with timing, to go on to this next point of concentration more

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.000
 specifically.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 And here in the chapter, which is first, they say discipline, body, speech, and mind is the basis,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 and the next comes concentration, which means it deals more directly with the mind.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 The discursive dualistic mind is always running around, running wild.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 We only have to look to our own minds to see this,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 and that mind always comes before the activities of our body and speech.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And so in order to develop concentration, we have to be our own teacher.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And of course we receive teachings and instructions on how to tame our body, speech, and mind,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 but we're the only ones who actually can apply these instructions in our lives.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 And that developing good concentration takes time.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 We have to continually be mindful and apply the instructions properly with joyful effort.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 But the more we practice properly with joyful effort,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 the more we will reveal the hidden natural goodness qualities of our minds.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 And that there are three experiences that can arise when we practice concentration techniques,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 and they are bliss, clarity, and non-thought.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Remember Chai say bliss is healthy, and it reveals our inner qualities

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 as they pervade our mind and our entire body, regardless of the external circumstances.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 And clarity is more the experience of when the mind is very clear and bright,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 and we feel very light, and oftentimes many insights arise.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And that third experience of non-thought is when we remain undistracted by our thoughts,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 that if thoughts do arise, they don't disturb us,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 that we can intentionally remain in meditation without being distracted by thoughts

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 for longer and longer periods of time.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 And while these three experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-thought

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 are natural results of concentration,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 it's very, very important not to be attached to them,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 and just to continue practicing according to the instructions.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And so that in this chapter is principally on this topic of concentration.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Does someone else want to read this second point here?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 To discipline your mind and have concentration, you need to become your own teacher.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 A skillful teacher can give guidelines and instructions to assist you,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 but real discipline and concentration must come from yourself.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 External supports or forces cannot subdue your mind and bring good concentration.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 To develop discipline and concentration requires continual practice with joyfull, joyous effort.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Page 28.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Well, I have a question, and it had to do with the bliss, clarity, and non-thought.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Are they related to the three chiles?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 I think they're said to be transformations of the three poisons.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 And I think they're related to the three chiles too, they're talking about that way.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So non-thought is more related to the transforming ignorance.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Bliss is the transformation of attachment, and clarity is the transformation of anger.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And they really specifically say these are really natural qualities,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 and they arise naturally.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And even in the nature of the mind, like, has these qualities naturally,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 but it's the grasping, it's the problem.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 So when we grasp to these qualities, then they become the poisons.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And when we don't grasp to these experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-thought,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 they become just the natural expressions of how our mind and body are when they're balanced.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.250
 And so you could say more, I mean, I think it's related to that non-thought is more related to the

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.000
 formless aspect of our mind.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 So that's more dharmakaya.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And then I think the bliss is always more related with the sambhoka kaya, the bliss emptiness.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.690
 And then the more arising kind of outreaching qualities of mind or activities is more related with

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.000
 that clarity,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 the more distilled or crystallized expressions of mind, which is more related with that clarity.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Would that be dharmakaya?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Yeah, so dharmakaya.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So how about concentration itself?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 I mean, how could we wrap up? What is concentration?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 How do we concentrate, like within the Buddhist terms on the Buddhist path?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 Well, I like this sentence on page 27.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 It's just right as Rinpoche started talking about concentration on page 27, this fourth paragraph,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 saying that, "Until we develop good concentration, we will remain on the surface of the mind

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 without discovering its deeper wisdom."

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 I really like that sentence because it shows how these three trainings relate to each other,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 that discipline is really where we start, we prepare the ground, we determine our destination,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 and then concentration is really where we begin to really move inward.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 I mean, it's really where we stop and start to really look inward at the mind.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And then it progresses inward, and we'll talk about wisdom more in a minute,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.400
 but that's just like the deepest, so kind of like starting out here in a more outer way with our

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.000
 discipline in conduct,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 and concentration is where we really start, we settle our minds.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And there's a lot of different types of concentration practices,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 but it's really like just how we begin moving inward.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Can you say here that discipline, like just related with what you said,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 discipline is much more related with body and speech,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 and then concentrations related with mind, but what part of mind?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 The discursive, dualistic, conceptualizing part of mind, so lessening that, taming that,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 and that wisdom, the third, is more related to the non-conceptual wisdom aspect of our mind,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 or the primordial wisdom of our mind.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 So it is that progression of deepening from the more outer, apparent level,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 to the more inner, all-pervasive, natural way of how the mind is.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And Kemper Rinpoche specifically was talking about that in the

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.630
 "Mountain of Treat" instructions of his sonus, teacher Rinpoche, two years ago, in those

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.000
 instructions.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 I was going to say, so basically could we say, I mean if we look at like meditation,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 it seems like that's kind of definitely something involved with concentration.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Of course we need to concentrate to do any activity,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 but especially if we're working with our mind, concentration.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 So then, I mean, again, just kind of remembering.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Rinpoche's talk more later in the book, but just how that relates to, like,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 shamatha meditation and vipassana, or how that, especially shamatha,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 it seems, a calm, abiding meditation results, is an embodiment or a method

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 of actually applying concentration.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 So what types of shamatha are there? There's two types.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 There's two types of shamatha. There's with an object and without an object.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 So what's with an object? What's the example?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 With an object would be if you have a beautiful image of the Buddha,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 and you're going to focus right on the Buddha's third eye.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And that's just an example. Or anything, a beautiful flower

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 or something that catches your eye, meaning the instructions.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 What's without object?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Without object could be visualizing. But when we're just imagining or visualizing,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 seeing something, seeing the third eye of the Buddha,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and then there's also just completely formless,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 kind of just, oh, where the object is maybe awareness itself.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 We're holding something in mind, but it's very subtle,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 and it might not be an apparent object, but our mind is still holding an object.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 I did have a question that comes to concentration too.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Why, you started to talk about this when you're going to elaborate on it a little bit.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Particularly when we're talking about the shamatha and the vipassana,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 particularly since the first is more of that just concentrating on what's there,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 and then the vipassana being how you cut through it

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 and seeing that it's not the way that you habitually held it to be.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Would vipassana then go more into the wisdom qualities

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 that we're talking about in the third point coming up,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 or does that still fall more into concentration?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Or is it that vipassana gives rise to the wisdom?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Vipassana is the wisdom. So a shamatha or concentration is we're holding something in mind,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 either an outer object or we're holding onto an inner object,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 something that we're visualizing or space, for example.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 But regardless, the mind is holding onto something.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 There's a sense of self holding onto what is not self, an object.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Then the wisdom or the vipassana, the supreme or extraordinary insight

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 or seeing, extraordinary seeing, is in that type of technique,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 the mind isn't holding anything.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 The mind is just releasing all holding, all grasping,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 and trying to naturally recognize and abide in how the mind is

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 when it's not grasping onto anything.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And they say when the mind is doing that,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 what it's doing is recognizing its primordial wisdom

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 and sustaining that recognition. So that's vipassana,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 so that's the third part of the wisdom training.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Supreme seeing, that's the translation of vipassana.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 And isn't it when you do some analysis, like you turn the mind,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 you say you look at the mind and ask what is it or what color is it?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Isn't that vipassana?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 It can be. I think there's styles of vipassana,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 once a more deductive or inferential style, where you ask an analytic,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 it's like analytic meditation, you intentionally ask a conceptual question

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 to lead to a non-conceptual recognition

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 of how your mind is when it's not holding onto any question.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 You ask a question to your mind and the answer is not holding onto an answer.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 I mean, vipassana like that.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 But then just to directly look, like without kind of trying to conceptualize it,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 then that's like more of a direct technique for vipassana.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Do these three trainings necessarily build on each other?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Like, do you see that you need to have a foundation of discipline

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 before you can really begin to have concentration?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 You really need to have that foundation of discipline and concentration

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 before you have that practice of wisdom.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Or is it that they grow altogether?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 I think it's both.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 But the foundation is discipline and ethical conduct.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Without that, you don't have anything at all.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 You have your normal, ordinary, wild, outrageous habit patterns.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 That's what you have.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 So to think that you really have concentration or some kind of stabilized way.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I mean, it's a dynamic thing, like say the three vowels.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 The outer vowels are the Vinaya and then the Bodhisattva vowels

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 and then the Tantric Samayas or the Tantric vowels.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 And how one is related more with conduct on the outer level.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 The other one is related more with maintaining compassion for all beings

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 and cultivating that and not doing others wrong or yourself.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And then the Vajrayana is really related with wisdom,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 maintaining pure perception, maintaining the view.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 They're all totally based on each other.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Maybe if this is the foundation and this envelops concentration,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 which envelops wisdom, but they're all just like,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 I think as your concentration gets better,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 your discipline gets better, your wisdom gets better.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 As your wisdom gets better, your discipline gets better,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 your concentration gets better.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 But at the same time, you're also saying that one can't skip the discipline

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 and just go straight to, "Oh, I'm wise!"

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 And practicing wisdom without taking that time to relate to the mind

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 in a way that's disciplined.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 This is something that comes up a lot in the Vajrayana.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 There's also that aspect of, I mean, should we go to wisdom?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Because I think we only have like five minutes or something, but...

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Sorry.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 If we get there, I mean...

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 So I'll just do a quick version.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 It says in the chapter, which is based on discipline and concentration,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 we develop wisdom.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Wisdom is fresh, complete, and free of all grasping and confusion.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 It's a direct experience of the primordial nature of the mind.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 All sentient beings in Buddha share the same nature of mind,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 this primordial wisdom or Buddha nature.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 It's always there, but it's only temporarily covered up

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 by our negative habits, obscurations, and grasping.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 And though we already have this primordial wisdom nature of our mind,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 we have to reveal it by removing our grasping.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 So on the path, the most important thing is to work directly with our mind.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And then the best way to work with our mind

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 is with these three trainings of discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 So now if we highlight this wisdom,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 maybe we talk about wisdom instead of reading this topic.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 So that third topic point is on page 32nd and 4th full paragraphs,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 but maybe we'll go directly into wisdom.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 So what is the wisdom?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 I think we could look at wisdom. There's conceptual, right?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 There's actually, even just hearing the teachings is bringing us wisdom.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 And then there's when we are studying and discussing and contemplating,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 thinking about the teachings.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 That's another aspect of absorbing the wisdom even a little more.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 And then there's the non-conceptual wisdom,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 what we're really unveiling through our hearing and studying

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 and contemplating and practicing,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 which brings out the real primordial wisdom.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 So I thought those basic frames as far as how we could relate to wisdom in that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 So it's called the three wisdoms, wisdom of study,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 wisdom of contemplation, and the wisdom of meditation.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 It seems here particularly, when I'm looking through the writing of Rinpoche,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 it seems like they're referencing primordial wisdom here as well,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 particularly when I'm looking at the definitions of wisdom,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 or at least the way they talk about it here.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Wisdom is not something we can obtain from outside ourselves

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 that has been with us from beginningless times.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 So I think here it definitely seems like they're talking about the primordial wisdom.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And then I guess a question from that then.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 So when we're talking about these three trainings of discipline, concentration, and wisdom,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 and the way that Kempos seem to be particularly discussing primordial wisdom,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 do the other pieces of wisdom fit in with these three trainings then?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Or how is it that they would fit into the concentration and the discipline,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 particularly when we're talking about the wisdom of study or the wisdom of contemplation?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 My understanding is that that is wisdom.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 That's part of what we're doing here.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 When we're listening to the teachings and thinking about them a little bit

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 and seeing how they relate to and absorbing them, that's an aspect of wisdom.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 And then when we move deeper with actually applying and absorbing

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 so that we're revealing that aspect of revealing our Buddha nature

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 or any wisdom, primordial wisdom is there.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 I could be wrong, but my understanding is that those three wisdoms can really fall underneath this.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 And of course that relates to the teachings involved, all these other things,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.020
 but maybe especially the abhidhana, or the pure potential is also that aspect of the teachings

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.000
 themselves.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 But even if we look on the levels of the Four Noble Truths or something,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 we could see there's wisdom there, and then how do we apply them?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 So they work together for sure.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 That means creating causes and conditions for accumulating our merit

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 and kind of positive environments and positive conditions for revealing and unveiling,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 purifying our obscurations and revealing and ripening our primordial wisdom.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And they're definitely directly related with each other.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 It's a complicated answer.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 They say with Buddhist teachings there's two lineages, lineage of study, lineage of practice.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 So lineage of study is essentially tripitika, vinaya, sutra, abhidharma.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Lineage of practice is the three trainings, discipline, concentration, and meditation, or wisdom.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 So in order to do anything, whether we study or practice,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 we have to receive some kind of a teaching to actually start to investigate it.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 So all these tripitika ways of intellectually, conceptually,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 investigating, receiving instructions and teachings, and then starting to contemplate them,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 really think about them, see if it's true or not, and our own experience, testing them out.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 And that is the wisdom component of practice, having our conceptual mind engage with it,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 so that then when we apply it with the discipline,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 and then we apply it better, more directly to our mind,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 based on that foundation of tamed body and speech,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 and we go directly to our mind, working with these rough negative emotions and habits,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 then what are we applying the instructions that we receive through our study,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 and then that we're trying to contemplate intellectually with our contemplation.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 But then when really applying them in practice,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 then this really has to do with these three trainings,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 and then the most direct way of applying them is that third wisdom,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 the wisdom that's non-conceptual beyond all grasping,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 or the wisdom of meditation, where we directly apply that in our practice,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 which, as Andrew said, then re-informs all of the other things we do.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 If we can recognize primordial wisdom, then do that as we're engaging with our body in speech,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 or as we're holding the object in mind, or as we're studying, then everything becomes a meditation.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 So from that third wisdom, that's where we're trying to go to.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.150
 Everything in Buddha's teaching is oriented towards a view of non-grasping wisdom awareness of prim

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.000
ordial nature.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 It all leads there.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Then once we arrive there, then the whole thing is to actually refine that,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 have that come out more and more, like have our body and speech in mind more and more,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 always be in that state of balanced awareness, without any error or any grasping.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Just one tiny little thing I want to say, just in that same vein.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 It's just so beautiful, this line on the very second to last paragraph,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 very simple but so profound, just that this line that the primordial, sorry, page 30,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 "Although ignorance and obscurations cover our wisdom, the primordial nature is always radiating."

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 So really it's just even that the primordial nature is always radiating, always.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 So it's like, that's the wisdom component right there, that it's like you all were saying,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.290
 all these teachings are leading to whatever helps us be able to see that these qualities are always

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:12.000
 there.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 So I mean, that seems to me why, like what you said when I was like,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 it doesn't really matter which teaching it is that you're connecting to on a certain level,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 because it's always there.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 So whatever kind of like ushers that, kind of, to see that, connect to that.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 I thought there were two quick points.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 All of this requires joyful effort, again, again, again, whether it's study or practice,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 whether it's any of the three trainings, we have to keep engaging it,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 that otherwise we won't achieve our result.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 They said that, Rinpoche said that very many times in this chapter,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 and we see that in our experience, we keep having to re-engage it joyfully as much as we can,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 with a view of all beings in mind.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 And then secondly, I think the second wisdom of contemplation is so critical,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 and oftentimes we can skip it.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 We just can receive a lot of teachings, we don't really investigate them,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 we don't really review the notes, we don't really try to put it into practice so much.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 And then ten years later, we wonder why more change didn't happen.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 That contemplating, that really personally engaging the teachings,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 thinking about it, applying it, coming after we practice it, then reviewing it again,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 that that's really key, that contemplation, wisdom,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 is so key with having our study be effective and having our practice be productive.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Just thought I'd mention that.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 On that point, I know we're out of time, but I have...

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Wisdom, we shouldn't think that it's just some far-off thing that's very technical

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 and very far down the path.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Anytime we realize something about our mind or our habit patterns or our conduct,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 we learn something, we learn something true.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Anytime that we realize something true, closer to the way things are,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 that leads us towards our destination, that is wisdom.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 I mean, it's a smaller wisdom, maybe, than a big something else, but it's important to...

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 And how that relates to what Drop was saying with conceptual accuracy or what's working.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 And then, of course, there's the non-dual, non-conceptual, ever-present wisdom

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 we're trying to unveil through connecting with that analytic and accurate perception

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 and conception.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 And, of course, there's so much more to say,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 and everyone, we can stop talking now, and everyone else can enjoy their study time together.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 So we'll dedicate the merit briefly.
