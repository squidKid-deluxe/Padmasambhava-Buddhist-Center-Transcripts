00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 And now from that pure land, the Buddha of Amitayu, and the Buddha of Amitayu, or Amitabha,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:28.020
 then, ought to benefit to this role, then the emanation came in here, is known as the Penma Sambha,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.680
 or the Guru of Penma Sambha.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.080
 So Guru of Penma Sambha is directly emanation of the Buddha Amitayu, or the Amitabha,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:46.790
 in order to help and benefit, remove the suffering and the difficulties of the beings of this world

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.920
,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 particularly then, of course, all the living beings.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.080
 And that emanation is known as that, as what we all know, Buddha, Guru of Penma Sambha.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:12.200
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:30.320
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.320
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.640
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.840
 Now, the Guru of Penma Sambha is, again, direct emanation of the Buddha Amitayu.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.520
 He's already enlightened beings, absolutely enlightened beings,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.320
 both relative to the level and as well absolute level, totally enlightened beings.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 But yet, to kind of demonstrate it, to inspire to the other followers that enlightenment is not

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.120
 just going to come,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 without having the devotion, joyful effort, courage and commitment, determination,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 and then, with all those, we cannot reach enlightenment.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.540
 But to show that, to teach that to us, then Guru of Penma Sambha also demonstrates learned practice

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.920
, meditation,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.920
 and kind of on the appearance, on the surface level, in a way, that he showed that to us.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.520
 He also showed that he meditated practice and then become very high realization, one after another,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.920
 or enlightenment.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.720
 And then also, in the teaching, he said that even though he's already Buddha Amitayu himself,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.120
 but on to again, to show to us, then he practiced the Buddha Amitayu,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.120
 together with the Western Rakini, known as Madanava, in the cave Marathika, Marathaka Cave, in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.120
 about three months.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.320
 After that, during three-month practices of the Buddha Amitayu,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 Buddha Amitayu came instantly in the space of the Guru of Penma Sambha and Western Rakini,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.320
 Madanava, and the Buddha Amitayu empowered both of them, and become inseparably Buddha Amitayu.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.720
 Again, reignited his realization in one way, that and become immortal state of the rainbow body,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.520
 or indestructible state of the rainbow body, that until samsara is completely empty,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.620
 until that long, when Guru of Penma Sambha's continuation emanation and Guru of Penma Sambha, as

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.120
 Guru of Penma Sambha,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.240
 our present will continue to stay, and that's what is then known as the Buddha Amitayu inseparably,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.520
 Guru of Penma Sambha.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:33.710
 Then, in the eighth century, Guru of Penma Sambha came to Tibet, as you all know, as the invitation

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.520
 of the King to Sondenti.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.640
 Guru of Penma Sambha gave many teachings to many of those dedicated practitioners, including King

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.720
 to Sondenti,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.820
 and particularly, Guru of Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment of the Buddha Amitayu to King to S

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.720
ondenti, and as well as others,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.630
 because life is generally, everyone's life is very precious, life is very precious, health is very

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.520
 precious,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:11.720
 and therefore, the Buddha Amitayu is the Buddha to extend the life and health, and the longevity,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:22.810
 and for that reason, then, Guru of Penma Sambha gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti at the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.920
 cave known as Yamala, Sami Yamala Caves.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:38.320
 The Buddha of Penma Sambha came to the cave known as Yamala Caves, and the Buddha of Penma Sambha,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.320
 and the Buddha of Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.320
 and the Buddha of Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.320
 and the Buddha of Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:04.400
 and the Buddha of Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti, and the Buddha of

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.720
 Penma Sambha also gave the empowerment to the Cait to Sondenti,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.930
 and the Cait to Sondenti is also going to receive, with joyfully, this empowerment of the Buddha

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.720
 Amitayu,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 but however, there is an interruption came. An interruption is that, because at that time,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.410
 it's the very beginning of the time of the Buddhism, and not everyone is practicing Dharma in Tibet

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.720
.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:42.720
 There are many powerful ministers who are very pro-native religious, known as Pong religions,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:51.720
 and then as well as his Queen, also known as Margisa, was very devoted to the native Pong religions

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.720
.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.720
 And all, every foreign, those teachers, including Guru of Penma Sambha,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.720
 every those Pong masters, ministers, and queens, all are very suspicious, true to everyone.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.370
 And when Guru of Penma Sambha was going to give this teaching or the empowerment of the Buddha Amit

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.720
ayu to Sondenti,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:22.300
 Ed came, known as that Sami Yamalong, and when this queen and minister discovered that he is going

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.720
 to receive those teachings,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:33.620
 and they taught so much suspicious, taught a lot of suspicious, and this might be something going

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.720
 to make,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.720
 not good, but bad, to Cait to Sondenti.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:48.720
