00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.550
 "We have to continue to keep up these practices. Even though nature is completely free and there's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:28.720
 nothing really to change, but for us, we have to have some guidelines.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.070
 Guidelines how to keep up the practices, to discover this nature. To keep up these practices, keep

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.360
 up that guidelines, is known as the samayas.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.900
 In the Dzogchen level, there are two samayas. Two samayas, those are known as the samayas that have

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.240
 to be guarded, G-U-A-R-D, I think.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:05.630
 Samayas that have to be guarded in samayas, or have to be guarded in samayas and unguarded in samay

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.280
as, or that we don't have to guard, or have samayas that have to guard, samayas that don't have to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.920
 guard.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.530
 Samayas that have to guard, and that is, then generally, there is also called generative approach

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.600
 in Dzogchen teaching, those are known as general samaya, pacific samaya, and very pacific samayas,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 those are known as three samayas generally.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.710
 And just generally, we are talking of the whole view of the samayas. And the first is, the general

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.100
 samaya is very general, with all further teachings, what are those samayas, what teaching says, and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 what we receive.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:01.270
 I mean, again, the Theravada, or the Hinayana vowels, and those are, those vowels, and then Bodhis

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:10.520
attva vowels, and the Vedayana vowels, and even though there are so many details, but we highlight

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.880
 that, what the teaching says.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 That avoiding all the negative activities directly, indirectly, it is the essence of the Hinayana

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.960
 vowels, essence. Think of that, avoiding all the negative activities, directly, indirectly.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:48.380
 Negative means what? Disturbing, hurting others, and ourself, directly, indirectly. Avoiding that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.520
 is Hinayana vowels.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.820
 Now, keep that, but that teaching, again, as you all know, is not something completely different,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:08.910
 all lined up, all lined up, keeping that vowels, keeping that, above that Mahayana, Suttar Mahayana

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.680
 vowels.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:19.100
 What is it? Performing the beneficial activity directly, indirectly, to yourself, to all the beings

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.280
, is the essence vowels of the Mahayana, Suttar Mahayana vowels.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.560
 So that is the, so now we have two. First is the Hinayana vowels, or Hinayana or the basic Buddhism

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 school vowels. They avoid all the negative activities, directly, directly, to ourselves, to others.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.600
 And the second is performing, above that, performing the beneficial activities directly, indirectly

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.660
, to you or to others, that. Above that, see everything as in a three-weather status, everything is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.280
 negative.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:08.160
 So every day, three-weather status, whether a form, whether a speech, whether a mind, is, is then

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.520
 the, the Mahayana vowels.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:20.880
 And we keep that, that is known as the general vowels of the Mahayana, general vowels.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.750
 Then, the Pacific vowels as many sub-divisions. So if I just highlight again, the Pacific one,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.960
 highlight those again.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.800
 And those are known as the vowels of the related Vedic, five dhyana vowels. Five dhyana vowels.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:58.560
 And the putting down vowels that we chant in every time, our sub-singement is 10th diphrydia, dakk

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.960
hi diphrydias, putting down vowels at big ones, and that also we chant during our sub-singement.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:20.000
 So those are, say, kind of roughly as Pacific or Jirrei, Jirrei, and Pacific vowels or Samayas.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.130
 Then, very Pacific vowels of the dakkhi teachings, or the inner tantra, three inner tantra

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.760
 teachings, and that is then highlighted here, here.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.090
 And that is as true, that vowels that have to be watched or good, vowels that not have to be good,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.560
 two vowels, or Samayas that have to be good and have to be not good.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.440
 And Samayas that have been worded, that we went through, and that is connected with the teachings.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:01.520
 All the teachings, there is like nine outer vowels, nine inner vowels, nine single vowels, that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:09.280
 which is connected with the body, speech, mind of the teachings, also in the dakkhi teachings or

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.760
 the inner tantra, the name.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:21.980
 And now the teachings, again, the teachings, it looks like a teacher is not good, it has to be

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.640
 watched and good, the vowels are even keeping with the teachers.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.960
 And that's really true. But it's not just a teacher, one teacher. This is the lineage teachings.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.040
 Lineage teachings start as we talk, from the Buddha, some of the butters.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:50.540
 So, until the Buddha, some of the butters, everyone observes those 27 vowels, vowels as their

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.000
 teachers, related with their teachers.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.230
 So that means, of course the God of God and various others, they don't have to be good. But for us,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.000
 for us, from now on, from here, all the way to that, I'm going to give my son one.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.760
 Every teacher has to be observed to their vowels as their teachers, teachers, so that means that

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.520
 teachers don't have to observe, only the students have to observe.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:35.400
 That, not that, the teacher is a student of their teachers. And that teacher is a student of the

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.040
 previous teachers.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.520
 So therefore, everyone, that means everyone has to keep up the vowels.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:54.220
 And while all together, 27, as I said, nine vowels of the body, related with the body of the

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:02.910
 teacher, nine vowels of the speech of the, connected with the speech of the teacher, and nine vow

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.520
els of the connected with the mind of the teachers.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.520
 And now, when of course, teachers, how, generally, how many teachers? In the very other teaching,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.040
 there is, you can call it, nine, sorry, six different teachers.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.720
 And that can be, also, can be one teacher, can be all of those, two teachers can be all of those,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.040
 or maybe could be one individual teacher, all one of those.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:42.680
 All total, can be like, highlighted as six different teachers. So those are teaching, personal

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:51.810
 teaching, teaching is what? All, generally, all teachers are called general teachers, general

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.040
 teachers.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.740
 When you receive the teaching, or when you receive the teaching, teaching is all respected one of

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.040
 the levels. All one of the levels, those are known as general teachers.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.680
 And the second teaching is known, teaching is known as one who you aspire to the path, one who

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.040
 gives you the vowels.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.550
 Those are known as teacher of the vowels, such as, in this case, many times, who perform the rafuja

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:27.040
 sayyimos, give the rafuja vowels.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.790
 And all that is known as, all vowels of the bus, or bus cars, vowels of the, any other kind of, in

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.040
 the Buddha's teachings, vowels, we give the vowels.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:50.080
 Those are known as that, the one who guided to the path, so God, or one who ushered to the path, so

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.040
 this is the path, teacher of the ushering path.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.110
 And the second is teacher of the one who give the initiation, so not second, third, one who give

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:10.040
 the initiations, shishas, and empowerment, initiations.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:19.650
 Those are known as the giver, teacher, which is the giver of the initiations, and the transmissions

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.040
.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:28.040
 Those are known as, then, this is the third, teacher's, giver of the teacher.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:38.620
 And then, poor teacher is one who also is helping you, always guiding you, and helping you, guiding

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:47.040
 you, help you, redirect us to the path of always inspiring and kind of adjusting to the path.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:55.040
 And help you to put it by our negativities, our obscurations, or broken minds.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 So those are known as purification teachers, or who help to purify us.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:12.520
 And the fifth one is the teacher who is making explanations, explanations, teachings, that we don't

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.040
 understand.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.040
 They will clarify, explaining, and going through the teaching one after another.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.040
 Another one going through the teachings.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 Those are known as, who is the clarified teacher, or who is going in the clarifications, teachings.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:36.040
 And the sixth one is the teacher of the beat instructors, and who is giving the beat instructors,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 such as Zouji teachings, all Mahamudra teachings, all the teachings of the nature of the mind.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.040
 Those are known as, those are known as the teacher of the beat instructors.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.040
 So those are all known as six different teachings.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:59.040
 Now all these six teachings are generally also known as, then, nada-teaches.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 I mean, that is highlighted one of them.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.040
 And that is known as, then, many times we call root teachings.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.040
 Root teachings. What means root teachings?

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:16.740
 Generally, root teaching is, is something that you feel so connected, is inspired, help you

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.040
 immediately, instead, that becomes a root teacher, generally, for example.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.040
 For example, the great master, Maharajas, Mahabharis, become immediately his root teacher.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.040
 You don't have to do any, all those different things.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:37.470
 Instead, with the, according to the life story, according to his story, instead, one teacher, Mahab

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.040
har most of the time, that's it.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.310
 Really, he said that, he listened, he followed, he received the teaching, and then enlightenment,

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.040
 so root teachings, that is.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.040
 And then, generally, that is not just that.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:13:00.040
 And for example, for Yummi Lang Bhaa, Yummi Lang Bhaa, considering Yumchi Bhaa, his root teachings.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:06.430
 Yummi Lang Bhaa and Tungchi Bhaa, between Yummi Lang Bhaa and Tungchi Bhaa, there is a long gap of

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.040
 the times.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.040
 But however, when he is meditating, he received the personal body of Yumchi Bhaa three times.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.040
 After that, he completely explodes of the true nature, exactly as it is.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.040
 And he has completely overflowed of these primordial Muslims.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.040
 He didn't have to go through all those intellectual starting systems.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.040
 He completely becomes such a great scholar, scholar, master of Buddhism.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.040
 And he considered, his Longchi Bhaa become his root teacher, always there.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 But normal times, all the time, root teachers are there.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:54.040
 Known as one who gives the involvement and the transmission,

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
 one who gives you the explanation of the teachings of the Tantra,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.040
 and one who gives you the peace instructions, that is known as the root teacher.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 And therefore, many times in the teachings, I'm sure you read, Master Book, read that the teacher,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.040
 who been three different ways of kindness, three different kindness,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.040
 kindness of the giving the involvement and transmission,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.040
 kindness of the making explanation of the teachings, clarifications,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:32.040
 and kindness of the who giving the instructions of the nature of the mind.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:40.040
 That is known as the - then the kindness wrote to teachers,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.040
 a forward in the other approach of the Buddhist teachings, that,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040
 or the many other teachings.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.040
 So now, with that understanding,
