00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 Now we are going to do the Empowerment. To receive the Empowerment, you are going to receive

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.080
 this Empowerment by four different ways, by meditations, and with a segregated ritual object,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.840
 and with mantra, and with leading blessings. Those are the four different techniques that

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 will receive the Empowerment. Empowerment is one of the very powerful and special techniques

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.920
 of the Vadiyana teaching. Vadiyana teaching has so many different, so many skillful means

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 to activate our innate Buddha nature so that we can benefit all living beings. Empowerment

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.600
 is considered one of the very important and powerful techniques that will instantly dispel

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:00.560
 the duality, consumption, or handless duality, and bring out the inner western light, and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.600
 by this power, by this religious blessing. So this Empowerment is considered very special

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.480
 techniques in the Vadiyana teachings. And again to receive this Empowerment, as I said,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:23.720
 by four ways. Meditation, and then ritual object, and mantra, leading a blessing. Four combined

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.480
 together with this Empowerment. First is, now we are going to meditate. How are we going

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.440
 to meditate? And that is an exciting aspect of teaching, explaining how we meditate. So

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.480
 I will again go briefly with this meaning. But again, why we are not enlightened? Why

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.120
 we are not Buddha? Because of the dualities. Duality is our own creation. Nobody else created

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.920
 and uploaded to us. We create the dualities. And the duality, and we kind of think, don't,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 is grasping, clinging. They are clinging and grasping. That has become the handless. And

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.840
 if we divide that grasping, what grasping comes somewhere, and grasping to the good,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 headed to the bad, or what we lack to do. And so grasping to what we lack, and hating

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.960
 a distant thought, to that what we don't like. That lacking, like and not lacking, is the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.560
 like, principle of fundamental obstacles that we start with. Reality level, everything is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.440
 displayed. Everything is displayed, is emanation, is like dreamless. There is no substantial

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.550
 solid existing entity. It's the good, that's the bad. There is no market, the good and the bad. It

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.960
's all

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.560
 mentally created and holding on to that. And in reality level, according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.680
 it's empty. It's all totally free. It's nominated by our mind, our duality. And then we continue

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 to pursue that onto that. And then we make, we get troubles, challenge one after another. That's

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.480
 not how duality made the handless to us. But now, we're going to get blessings of the Buddha,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.760
 actually, and activated our inner nature with all the interference of the duality. In order to do

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 that, first we have to be, go back to our nature. Our nature is pure from the beginning. Our nature

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.760
 of the mind is pure from the beginning. It is also open, is emptiness, this end of freedom. That is

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 what our nature is. Not just only our nature of the mind, but reality level according to the Buddha

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.840
's

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.280
 teaching, whole universe is that. There's no substantial solid existing entity at all. It's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.160
 all display, arising, this place. This arising display is what in the Buddhism whole, no? The

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.960
 interdependent co-ordination. Arising, not just arising one by one, it is entities, or by one

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 power. It's all combined, all intermingled, all support each other. Each of those supporters are

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.840
 also illusion, are their magic, magical disciplines. That's how all this world started. And for

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.040
 that

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.760
 reason, gracious teacher, Buddha pointed, all relative truth, all relatives. Why is it called

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.640
 the truth? It's like truth on the illusion levels, exactly. But reality level is not, it's

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.080
 relatives.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.200
 That is what it is. But now this time we're going back to the organ and natural state of our own

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.040
 mind. That is known as pure from the beginning, as I said. Great emptiness, great freedom status.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.600
 In order to do this, again, here's the teaching. If you have this booklet, you can look to do that.
