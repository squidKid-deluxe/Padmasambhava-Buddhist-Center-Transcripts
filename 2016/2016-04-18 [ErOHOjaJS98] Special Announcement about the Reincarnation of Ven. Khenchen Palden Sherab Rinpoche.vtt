00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The Happy Guru Mooji's 10th Day. 10th Day Bhuja, Chimi P. M. Mioni is one of the very

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.680
 glorious days in all the Sangha members. All of us is beautiful. Truly for me is one of the great

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 proponents of my reach that I had a long time. Since the great Master K.G. Padme H. Rinpoche

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.670
 into the Mahakarin Nirvana. I always think, always pray how I can discover, find out the reincarn

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.040
ation

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.360
 of the great Master K.G. Padme H. Rinpoche. Truly he was one of the great masters. So humble,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.120
 so simple, drawn to the art. That's what I like. That's what the great Master Bota Chaki Mouni

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.200
 taught. That's how he did. He gave up the royal kingdom, leapt on the forest and moving a whole

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.440
 lifetime in the bare feet with holding the arms ball. Arms ball and sleeping under the trees.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 And the teaching of love, kindness, compassion, joy and peace and discovering the true nature of

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.680
 the one's own mind and to everyone. That's what Buddha did. And all those great masters did.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.880
 Truly K.G. Padme H. Rinpoche was one of the very beautiful, great masters. Follow that same manner

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 and same path. Dharma is his heart. Dharma is his blood. Teaching is his like breath, breath.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.760
 Vinaya teaching, Sutra teaching, and Abhidharma teaching. Vinayana teaching is part of his

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.240
 himself and he always kept that. Since he had the opportunity to become a state ordination

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.440
 and practice Dharma, he never lingered that with him and never compromised and kind of like fell

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.960
 apart. He really truly maintained that. That I admired. He had so many opportunities. He can do

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.560
 many things. But always maintaining in the Dharma and the teachings. And truly I was fortunate that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 he was my also brother. And one of the great master's kindness that who kept me under his

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.840
 wings and under his elbows all the time that he nourished and kept up this. And today in the way,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.000
 not in the way, I performed that dream. That I had the great opportunity to find the reincarnation

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.520
 of our great beloved master. I had that thought as he said so many times. And also I mentioned

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.840
 that many times to the many of my Tibetan Dharma friends. Everyone also told me, "Oh, I mean,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.280
 that's a tradition." They should all say, "Oh, we have to definitely, we should follow. We should

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 ask to His Holiness Dharalam or we should ask to the head of the new school, His Holiness Dharam

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 Sepral Ramadhi Master." And him all days were another famous master known as His Holiness

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.800
 Dharam and His Holiness Dharam. That's the tradition and everybody follows with that.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.320
 But I myself thought I have the very kind of hermitage style of nature. My nature is more

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.080
 hermitage. Kinti Ramadhi also like that to me. He's a hermitage. He's not like to be engaging in

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.320
 all these things. It's truly every pursue those great masters. I'm sure they will also recognize

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.960
 him, one of those that. But it's to going doing this, following these steps, I always little bit

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.360
 kind of like tired for me. For me, there's a lot of also broke crisis. And there's also going back

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.360
 and forth, back and forth. Both summaries. I don't have that kind of like capability to pursue that

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.120
 again, and again, and again, and again, and says, and says, and then finally, maybe they will

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.480
 accept

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.600
 that. Also, I look the like index of the whole those great master recognize the true course,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.840
 how much really the true course that become really true course. I looked in the chart of the index

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.920
 of

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.080
 this. I'm kind of in a way, let us stop skeptical and more kind of also I like to be like kind of

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.200
 a little more intellectual become looking into the chart. And whenever those truly genuine,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:30.480
 generous, really so good with that, but many of the times not really exactly as we wish as that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.200
 goes, great master would recognize it, wish it, wish it, they almost are kind of become opposite,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.440
 opposite. Of course, it's good for them. When you nominate a true or nominated that moment,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.280
 the troopers are honored as the princes or prince immediately that are benefited to them.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.040
 But truth to me, the reincarnation emanations, why is it emanating? Because to benefit to the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.880
 teaching to the to the beings to happen to the beings, through love, kindness, compassion,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.120
 through the good examples, example stories, that's what really and the keeping of the legacy of the

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 visions of formal that llamas or whatever that or that bodhisattvas that for many times it kind of

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.130
 falling apart that minute even those great master recognize that at that really happened. Even

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.360
 though

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.400
 it's nice at the beginning time kind of good name, name or this master recognize this and that

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.720
 things

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.280
 that but that kind of level most of the balloons goes away and then just become very counter taken.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.680
 And the other hand, there's also many troopers are recognized by very kind of but low key

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.800
 general kind of great llamas, good llamas, good practicing. They are recognized also really become

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.560
 very powerful, very beautiful, very special to benefit to the beings and to the teaching,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:04.320
 exactly as that teaching said that. So I thought very many times of to whom I asked also in the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:12.080
 stability there's reincarnation of the of the of the satsang number. Also he's recognized a lot

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.760
 of troopers too, so I thought to ask him to that and then kind of looking into the heavens getting

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.840
 in

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.360
 my own song kind of thinking that to whom I should ask. Then I thought to go to ask to to I kind of

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.110
 feel very close to ask to there's a renowned great teacher, master Nadeto, known as Nampa Timi Ramb

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.440
utis.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.240
 Many of you maybe you don't hear, but he was the father of the wife of Satyam Mahara Rambutis.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.800
 Mahara Rambutis and Trungma Rambutis son that who is the head of the all the Shambhala Buddhist

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:56.880
 centers. Sentence. His wife's father is a renowned thetum, thetum of the kesha, particular kesha he

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.040
 become is you know. I kind of also there be what to him all these activities and what we did kind

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.200
 of

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.920
 more open, more praying, more direct, more straightforward. I really thought I think like

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.200
 to follow maybe to him because I don't have to go back and forth to ask this. Maybe once I

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.480
 recognize it I may be accepted and then just that. So maybe should I ask I thought that. I thought

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.800
 to

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.120
 ask him, but then our kind of Sangha members they're surprised. They might be very dumb apprentice.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.680
 They're surprised. I imagine that. They say oh yeah that's okay, but they can't for good surprise.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.680
 So I thought maybe then we all kind of like then we should have these old great masters that listen

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.120
 and include the Nampa Timi Rambutis and Nampa Trungma Rambutis. So what we thought. I thought maybe

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.280
 I

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:58.070
 should really do the divination. To whom is good to ask. Among the divination nation and that there

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.560
's

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.520
 I mean there's many divination things to be ready to do, but one that my father and the Kiki

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.640
 what he generally likes very much is marrow divination, marrow divination. And that's why

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:18.000
 for example I'm father able to come out of Tibet because of the marrow divination.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.720
 That there's many different marrow divinations and the best one marrow divination is the

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:32.720
 letter comes or that old indication the prediction comes upon the marrow. Marrow as a screen and a

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:41.920
 computer screen really comes and they transcribe that. There's very famous one in where I was born

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.920
 in Tibet and his name was Kathatrava and he was so renowned. When you ask him questions or when

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.480
 even you don't have to tell what you're asking, but you prayed wicked and give him some object

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:05.280
 or many times the grain of bollies. Grain of bollies and so you pray to that and put that

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.320
 your wish to that grain of the bollie and hand it over to this lama and he with his ceremony

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:21.680
 pray he throw that grain to the marrow that to be the ritual object marrow and then the prediction

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:32.400
 comes to him. Many times not many times it comes with two image as well as writing letters symbols

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:41.840
 and writing letters. That was the way it came to father when he went to see him when is the best

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.240
 time I should leave Tibet because communist tennis is really completely kind of like circling every

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:56.720
 direction so where I should when is a good time I should leave. He said you should leave before

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:07.040
 1959. If you pass 1959 according to video yet that was year of the big big year. If you delay

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:17.440
 further than the big year you cannot go out of Tibet. So you have to leave before the 1959 ends.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:28.240
 So that's what we kind of delayed and just before the big year end and in the middle of the winter

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:35.840
 we left. And that's how really the prediction is so accurate and so strong. And ever since

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.960
 the kingdom which is always a father likes to always do the better divinations. Many times

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.640
 he asks to do many different things. So I thought maybe I should I'm on the divination. I like to

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:56.560
 maybe ask mirror divination ask someone who really do the good one. So I call to of course we're

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:08.400
 talking back and forth on the phone in the Varanasi. I ask him do you any any mirror reader good

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.640
 one

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:16.800
 well known in Tibet. I asked him. He said yes I know someone. My friend who lives in Tibet he told

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:16.960
 me

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:26.450
 there's very quite well known in in a Tibet there's mirror reader and he knows. He knows that. He

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:26.640
 knows

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:33.680
 he's very good. Everyone said whatever he said it was really accurate very true always. So I asked

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:42.640
 him to please call him. Please call him and find out how we can reach to this Lama. Lama. So then

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.960
 Shiram Tarsi Lama. He called to Tibet. Tibet. And he he called how can we reach that mirror readers

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:50.960
.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.880
 This Lama he firmly said oh that mirror reader is right now with our village. I invite him to

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.280
 come here and he's here. Have you learned to ask. And then Shiram Tarsi Lama. He called me back. He

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:12.080
 said he's with him now. I said how wonderful that is really wonderful. Then could you ask to that

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.160
 our wishes. To whom we should ask which Lamas. His Holiness Thalo Tsevra Rambuchi who was head of

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.680
 the Nyingmama Nyingmah schools of Tibet Buddhism and his Holiness Dottokir Rambuchi. His Holiness

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:32.240
 Tsevra Rambuchi. And Nam Tia Truko which means thousand lumbarian connection in Tibet. And his

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:40.880
 M&S Nahuat Mir Rambuchi. To whom we should ask. Ask him. Please call and tell that to whom ask.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.560
 So he he called. And he these days there is very special techniques. You know that. And what's the

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:56.800
 name of this. We chart. Have you know that. You know. We chart. We chart. Chat chart. Chat chart.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.680
 We chart.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:04.640
 We chart is so free. Really you can talk back and forth. Back and forth. So we we charted

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:11.040
 and said these things. What we like to be divinations. And so this Lama did the divination

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:18.240
 marrow reading. Reading. And he wrote down everything. And then they sent back to

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.800
 Sriram Dharji. Lama Sriram Dharji in India. And Lama Sriram Dharji sent to me. Back to here. Here.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:34.400
 And so he said. Among all those Lamas. The best Lama is his Eminence Nahuat Mir Rambuchi.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:41.920
 Exactly what I thought. He is the best. Best. And he was. He is like Lama Nahuat Mir Rambuchi.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.240
 Well known Kesar Tertung. Tertung of Kesar. In his marrow reading he said he is the emanation of

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.480
 the

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:59.120
 famous name Kesar warrior. Jata. And Anu Sunkri. Two great warriors emanation joined together.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.960
 He is. He is the emanation of these two great warriors. And Kati Parthikaram which is the

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:14.320
 emanation of the another famous warrior of the Kesar. Known as Sunda Adum. Sunda is very famous.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:25.040
 And even he said I was also some part of that guru. That he was that guru. And is the best

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.680
 candidate

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.720
 is to ask to Nahuat Mir because of all these connections. Have you more delayed?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:40.800
 Delayed you cannot do that. Cannot do that. So then it really came like exactly. And then I said

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:49.680
 ask to ask. Ask Sriram Dharji why he said that this Nahuat Mir is reincarnation of who said

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:57.520
 that. I mean reincarnation of this Kesar and Kati Parthikaram. All these wife brought up that

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:04.960
 answer here. How that happened I said. I told maybe this because Nahuat Mir is well known

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.720
 Kesar Tertung. So I told maybe they really told oh he is Tertung this and that thing. Maybe then

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.240
 they just then this marrow reader is also writing that. I told him that. So I asked him how that

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:24.160
 happened. And then again Nahuat Mir, how you that happened. I mean why he say these things.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.400
 But it came on the marrow. He just he put that here. Said no. This is his friend. He said I never

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.560
 make anything about that. Except what you asked to ask. That is only asked. I never make anything

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:44.320
 about Nahuat Mir. Anything is all. He is writing that. He is that all come in the marrow. So then

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.960
 I thought really that's interesting. Very beautiful. So now we should pursue with this

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:56.000
 reincarnation with Nahuat Mir. So then I asked to and of course I'm here. I can't go there. So I

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.320
 asked

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:05.280
 now you should go. You're the only one that really can do this and is there and you should go

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:13.840
 and meet and recursive to Nahuat Mir Mooji and to find out. So when he went there and Nahuat Mir M

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.160
ooji

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.320
 also very open mind and he never said anything that I cannot do. I have no capabilities. I mean

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.040
 those are the many times in the usual kind of terminologies in disability they do. Of course

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.160
 many times they do. I can't do. I don't have capabilities. I'm not candidate of these things.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.920
 You have to ask better too. All the lemmas and this and that. There's all show goes on. I think

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.720
 whenever you know I'm sure that's what they do too. Those things. In a dharma world they do too.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:51.280
 Back and forth. Back and forth. And when he went there he never said anything. Okay I will do.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.760
 Look at mine. I will do. And I even told myself why must be why they're delaying to search

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:12.480
 of reincarnation. It's about time to do. But okay I will do. So then so that really comes so easily

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:20.720
 kind of nicely. And so then we put it in his his voice to mind and his head. So then finally

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:29.440
 make sure all the long story. There's so many other things going on. Long story to short then

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:39.360
 last week. That again three weeks. Last year sorry last year he said again very special. So then he

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.640
 looked through his dream. His vision. His kesadevanations. Through this. He also told at the very

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:54.800
 beginning he said that I will look at these days. All lemmas don't have reincarnations. But I will

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:03.840
 look that kinti patahiranamaji has is reincarnating or not in this world. Every reincarnating in

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.080
 this

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:11.360
 world where he is reincarnating. Isn't it a bit. Or is it Bhutan. Or is it Nepal. Or is it India.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:20.400
 Or where. I will take that there. So I will find the locations and then will tell you.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:32.000
 So the last autumn. And then he said he looked everywhere and search everywhere. He's not he's

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.680
 taken definitely a connection but not in Tibet. Not in Bhutan. Not in Sikkim. Not in India. And in

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.640
 Nepal. And then he looked away in Nepal. Where is the reincarnation. He also thought search through

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:53.600
 his words of the mind and the divination and the dream. He's taking reincarnation in Kathmandu

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.000
 Valley.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.360
 Valley. And where in Kathmandu Valley is talking. And then in the east direction of the Bodhanath

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:08.080
 Stupa or south west north. And then he said I think east. I didn't forget something. South.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:18.480
 South. That is taken. And then among that which tribe is taking reincarnation. To be the family

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:24.320
 is taking reincarnation. He said I mean really one after another. So then I said yeah that's really

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:30.080
 wonderful that. But then when he was went there. There at that time Nepal having so much trouble.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.600
 All this political troubles. And as well as as there's like strikes and there's no

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:42.380
 gas lines and all these things. So it's become so difficult to that. So the Hiram Taze just couldn

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:42.560
't

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:49.600
 stay there. He went back to South Varanasi. So that this now the New Year came to be. New Year

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:56.740
 came. And this year is also very special for the Murpema Sambab. Sambab is a monkey years. For Murp

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:56.960
ema

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.200
 Sambab is considered one of very special years in the Yuma Buddhism. Buddhism. And then I told to

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.680
 Hiram Taze and all of them. I think now you should go there. We have to go there. We cannot delay

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.320
 this. This place could you go again to this. Because I wish that we don't have to interrupt

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:21.840
 that when he said that to search in autumn time. But then that all happened. And now is really time

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:29.360
 we must go. And whenever you have the things you can go I want you to go as soon as possible. So I

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.530
 told him that. So he went over three weeks ago back to Nepal. And then he began to look in

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.160
 searching

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.960
 and all the candidate that what he give his eminent number to give the all the different

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.160
 names of the parents and direction and all that. So then he looked look at the search and finally

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.000
 then last week then he found right. Many candidates. Many candidates. Many candidates.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.040
 And this is the first candidate group of the group of the child and then second candidate.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:11.200
 And many times he said none of this has his own connection. And so third one when he give that

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.920
 and a child and a particularly the last one he said or then then he said the next day he called

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:31.440
 back to he said and this child really looks like a connection. I had so many dreams so many visions

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:40.400
 and also my guess I definition all that just this child is the looks like. But still we make sure

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:48.480
 that it is authentic or not. You have to do same only one hundred thousand ganachaka offering of

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:57.840
 and one hundred thousand the practice things of the Dhanapala Mahakala and the Mama Ekachati and

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:05.040
 as well as many many hundreds thousand of the prayers of the of the group in my summer to some

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:12.080
 some get the party loves in the summer and trying to do this this and then make the final decisions

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.640
.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.560
 So then he called back and I said yeah please do those so I try to kind of organize those things

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:25.360
 and then they did those ceremonies in Nepal in India in Tibet all those prayers so then he went

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:32.960
 back and then he called he called back and then he said then he is a confirmed now this is truly

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.080
 a connection and he was so many dreams and visions came one after another him after

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:49.440
 after these children and then even he said two days ago I was very pleased of what I made the

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:59.760
 decision really he said that and I had so many dreams and visions and and in way he said all those

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.320
 dreams and visions are indicating getting formal lives of the Keti party children what he said that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:14.080
 so the really here what he said this is his own uh writing teaching and visions of visions that's

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.640
 it

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:22.320
 in India he was a Keti party he was as Lalita Vedya that means one of the great masters of the

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:31.760
 new schools of the Tibet Buddha Lalita Vedya is very famous in the time of the here

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:37.840
 said during the time of in the Tibet during the time of the mermaid somewhere 25 disciple

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:45.840
 he was so called labra so called labra so called labra is this one this this one who was holding

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:55.040
 tagger this one and here also he said when he during the guess at the time he he said the

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:03.440
 gurudyamsi another warrior gurudyamsi last time was called this mermaid divination writer

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:12.400
 writer was during that one who wrote his mermaid he said samma adun so it's slightly different

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:20.240
 to in in the warriors and now he was a Keti party children which is and many different

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.840
 amanekians he talked tell one who said many different amanekian i pray i respect

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:36.560
 drifty from the heart and pray and blessed bless bless and as he had more visions in the vision he

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:44.720
 said the corn shells of dharma is blooming blooming and dharma drum is beating or

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:52.800
 beating and it's within the will of dharma and that will spread out all of those and

00:24:52.800 --> 00:25:04.320
 Victoria banner of the teaching is firmly erecting and all the secret teaching will spread out how

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.640

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:29.120
 and rahula and doji lekba doji lekba said that that that he thought this wonderful aspect of sign

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:39.200
 and then he or his name is i think that was the name he wrote down so that's what he

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:47.120
 wrote wrote and this was his long life prayer is ryan kanahek chukus long life prayers and he wrote

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:54.800
