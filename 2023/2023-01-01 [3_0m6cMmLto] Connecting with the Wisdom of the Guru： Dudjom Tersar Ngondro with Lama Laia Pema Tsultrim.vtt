00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.780
 And again, as always, as we're always reminded by our teachers, and I'll remind again myself

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.080
 and all of us, just as we set out on any endeavor, especially Dharma study, contemplation, practice

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.180
,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:29.060
 really connecting with our motivation is so very essential and critical. And so again,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.120
 this will take a few moments, as we begin this afternoon session, to again reflect with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.700
 these three motivations, which are the essence of all the Nanyanas teachings and practices,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.900
 which are connecting with our joy, our appreciation, recognizing and rejoicing and how precious

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.500
 our situation is, free of so many circumstances that would obstruct our investigation of our

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.340
 true nature. And bringing out our goodness qualities, we're endowed with so many beautiful

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.980
 outer and inner conditions, and free of so many situations. So really, connecting with

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:21.460
 that joy and appreciation within that context. And then of course, then our bodhicitta that

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 this moment, these moments, this hour, this life can truly go only to nourish and benefit

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.860
 countless beings. So really expanding our bodhicitta and acknowledging karma. And then

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:52.660
 again, our pure purity motivation of recognizing the inherent purity of our innate experience.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:22.580
 Reflecting on the five perfections. So we'll spend a few minutes reflecting on the teachings

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.700
 and I know a couple people had written in with questions. And both questions centered

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.940
 around the guru yoga, different aspects of the guru yoga, or, you know, the living teacher.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.940
 And as we all know, especially within the Vajrayana, the living teacher connecting with

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.720
 the guru, the lama, you know, that which is the perfection of wisdom, one who holds the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.180
 knowledge of the teachings, and not only the knowledge, but the realization and wisdom

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.900
 of the teachings have been matured in their own mind and speech. That is so precious and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 that's so critical and it's been so emphasized that we make a connection with that for why

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.860
 to bring out our own qualities, our own Buddha nature. So I just thought I would get to those

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.860
 questions since I think we didn't get around to that last week and the week the person

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.820
 wrote we didn't see the questions till after the session. So our apologies for the delay.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.700
 And so one person was just asking about, they say, is it necessary to be personally connected

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.900
 to a Buddhist teacher? Or can a student follow the written teachings offered by a qualified

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 Buddhist teacher? So I think, like I was just saying, I mean, definitely connecting with

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.700
 a living Buddhist teacher who's alive at this time and available to us, it's not only such

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:22.580
 a special opportunity, it's really stressed in the practice lineage how really important

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.460
 it is to make contact with a teacher. And of course, the important word there was qualified

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.540
 Buddhist teaching. So essentially that boils down to someone who has some degree of knowledge

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.580
 of the Buddhist teachings and is actually putting them into practice. And we have some

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.420
 confidence in through observing how they live their lives and hearing their teachings, not

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.740
 only the formal teachings, but also just observing how they go about things and, you know, the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.700
 example they set such as our beautiful teacher, Kempo Seo and Don Joe Rinpoche. It's really

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:16.740
 precious. And of course, we're so blessed there's so many commentaries by qualified

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.260
 teachers that are out there and definitely those are wonderful to read, to contemplate,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.620
 to really bring into our practice. But really, I would really encourage everyone if you were

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.980
 so blessed right now to have these great ones amongst us who are offering the teachings,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:47.060
 are offering empowerment, are offering transmission, are offering pith instructions, as well as the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:55.540
 whole body of the teachings. Those are really essential and critical that we make use of

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.300
 our opportunity. So of course, the situation, especially the last couple of years with the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:09.780
 pandemic, have made it harder to connect, to actually go physically and receive teachings

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.460
 or meet within a group situation or individually with a teacher, but things are starting to open

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:25.140
 up again. So really, if you can, take the opportunity to go to, you know, a retreat

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.300
 in person or, you know, to make an arrangement to meet with a teacher and ask, you know, because

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.220
 again, this is someone alive at this time who maybe, like any friendship, we can get to know each

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:47.220
 other. And we have that individual connection, which is really special. And the teacher can

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:54.100
 really, this aspect of our teachings is, you know, our confidence. And so of course, that's

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.420
 something

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:03.060
 we develop over time. But we should definitely make use of it. Sorry, I'm just finding where

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:20.500
 I put my other questions here. Where did they go? I just had them. Well, I think I can remember

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:32.660
 what they are. I can find them here. I thought I'd also say on that last point, Kim Po-se-wong

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.900
 Rinpoche, who of course is such an amazing example, both in his knowledge of the teachings

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.860
 and his realization of the teachings and his ability to convey them to us. And just a beautiful

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:54.260
 example he sets in every aspect of his life is so precious. And among those teachings, I know,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:02.740
 especially over the pandemic, he gave many, many kind of extended teachings on the qualities,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.940
 you know, or the qualifications of an authentic, you know, qualified teacher, as well as student.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:18.900
 So I know those are in the our PBC YouTube. So I'm sure you can find them there. Everything's

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:25.140
 labeled there. So I'm going to find this other question.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:39.860
 So these questions are more around the actual guru yoga itself.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:47.940
 Which, of course, here, we're practicing the guru yoga as instructed in the Dudham Tursar

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:55.060
 nundro. And you may read different instructions for different nundros that might have slightly

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.380
 different visualizations. And even sometimes, even within the same practice, we might hear

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:08.020
 slightly different things. So that's important to remember. But if it's coming from such great ones

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.020
,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:14.500
 as his own is Dudham Mupashe, Kenshin Pauldens, Shera Mupashe, Kempo Sei Wan Dong Mupashe,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:22.580
 we can have confidence that this is tried and true Buddha highway, really reliable instructions.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:33.540
 So a person was asking about, you know, when we do the guru yoga, of course, we visualize ourselves

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:42.740
 as Raja Yogini. And before of us is Guru Padmasambhava as the embodiment of our teacher

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:49.780
 of this life, as well as who embodies all the Buddhas of the three times, all the bodhisattvas,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:58.180
 all the our hearts, all the great, noble, enlightened beings. And then we make this

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:04.900
 application, and we mingle our mind and heart with the blessings of the guru, guru, and reciting

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:04.980
 the

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.740
 Vajra Guru mantra for as much time as we have possible. And as we're doing that, receiving the

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:18.500
 blessings from Guru Pashay's crown to our crown, from his throat to our throat, from his heart to

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:26.900
 our heart, to all of our three centers, and then pervading our whole body. And then in the end,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.540
 there's different instructions. And this is particularly where this question is about. So

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.940
 at the end of the practice, once you've been reciting the mantra, and doing the visualization,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:49.620
 we receive the final blessings, and then there's the dissolution of the practice. So here the

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:57.060
 person's asking, saying that it's really hard for them to dissolve Guru Pashay into a condensed

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:03.860
 light at the end. And it doesn't happen, that it just doesn't isn't happening for them, I guess,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:13.540
 and stays open, diffuse, then comes into her from the front and not the crown. So

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:23.140
 if that's how it's happening, that's something to acknowledge. And if you're feeling like

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.940
 Kempo Seyung and Pashay, Kenshin Pauld and Pashay have said so many times, and ever people have

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.100
 questions about visualization, especially around how precise we can follow the visualization,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:44.660
 always the first really important thing is that we feel the presence. We feel our, the preciousness

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:51.940
 of this direct connection. We feel the presence of Guru Pashay. And then of course, we have the

00:11:51.940 --> 00:12:01.860
 skillful means of the visualization. So, number one, feeling the presence. And I think if we're

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:10.020
 truly connected with our joy, our appreciation, our bodhicitta, our devotion, and openness,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:18.980
 you know, then that's number one important. So if that element is there, that's good.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:28.820
 And then, however, I'd also just encourage too, I mean, these are all skillful means practices.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:36.180
 These are all specific instructions that Guru Padmasambhava, the living Buddha of this time,

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:47.060
 gave us. And so there's, there's very skillful, powerful reasons for working with our habitual

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:57.540
 patterns that I'd say if we can, you know, staying with the feeling of the presence

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:07.300
 and with our bodhicitta and devotion, can gently, gently, you know, not ignore our ability to

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:16.420
 develop our concentration and our visualization qualities, then we should, then we should do that,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:23.540
 you know, if we can just spend, try to visualize a little bit as instructed, then that's also good.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:31.700
 So I think it's a little bit both ways, not being too tight or too loose, or, you know, but staying

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:39.860
 with the practice and really working on developing again, our concentration, as well as our non

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:48.500
 distraction, along with our devotion and big bodhicitta, and just being open for that.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:55.940
 And then with this particular dissolution at the end, I think what Rinpoche is, they describe

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:02.260
 in "Illuminating the Path" and then Dodhrim Rinpoche does in other texts too, there's different

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.660
 ways

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:11.300
 we can dissolve this, you know, and one is where Guru Rinpoche, you know, dissolves into light

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:18.020
 and then enters into our heart, you know, and that's usually through the crown coming down,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:27.700
 again, through what? Our central channel into our heart channel, into our heart, which again is

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.020
 said,

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.980
 the heart chakra is where our Buddha nature resides.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:43.140
 The other is that we as "Yeshisojal" just go forward and dissolve into

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:50.740
 Guru Rinpoche's heart. So who's going forward? Who's coming? Again, I think it's very open in

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:58.980
 reality, which way we're going, but so do what's comfortable, but my main point is try to follow,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.780
 do the visualization as it's instructed, I think is really good for all of us, but not being too

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:13.060
 tight and we have also part of this visualization is also again, right, is so much remembering,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:19.540
 remembering the purity, we're in the pure land as Vajrayogini.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:27.700
 So there's no reason to doubt, we're really with our practice fundamentally,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.460
 we're trying to put aside all of our doubt and hesitation when we're practicing.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:42.660
 All of our mundane conceptions and habitual patterns, we're releasing and connecting with

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.820
 what's fresh and true to the best of our abilities. And so part of that is visualizing ourselves as

00:15:50.820 --> 00:16:00.580
 Vajrayogini in pure land with Guru Rinpoche right here with us, which is the fact all the time,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:08.500
 I mean, that's the point of the teachings that that's not some story. Our story, our make believe

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:16.420
 is our obstruction to that we haven't recognized that what that truly means and how that already

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:25.940
 is, right? So even on that degree too, as far as visualization, we don't have to think that if

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:33.860
 even if we don't see ourselves literally according to the instructions, or we might be in a room

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.660
 with

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:44.820
 the furnishings of this particular world in this particular time, we don't need to recoil from

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:51.700
 that, we can know that is inseparable from the pure land. And I think that's a really important

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.380
 point that the teachers make with our visualization, you know, we're not trying to have a big

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.420
 disconnect,

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:06.100
 we're trying to just have a fuller connect with how things are. And then kind of along those lines,

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:17.460
 another question here is, in this time in culture, the person's not comfortable visualizing

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.100
 themselves

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:26.500
 as a naked Vajrayogini. So they've been clothing themselves in the visualization, and just thinking

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:34.180
 that wondering if that's acceptable from a dharmic viewpoint. So I think the answer is yes, it's

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:34.580
 okay.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:46.260
 But I think it's worth considering kind of again, the profound meaning of the practice. I mean,

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.780
 here again, when we're visualizing ourselves as Vajrayogini,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:18:00.660
 part of the instructions are that earth because Vajrayogini is the queen of space,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:10.340
 the mother of all the Buddhas is our own inherent, empty, open, pure nature.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:21.300
 And Yeshe Sojal is a living Buddha and perfect example of not only a living Buddha, but perfect

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:31.780
 student as well. And so, of course, in the instructions are, we are Yeshe Sojal with a ruby

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:40.970
 red complexion, you know, kind of in a female form around, you know, kind of really at the

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:41.620
 beginnings

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:49.890
 of adulthood. So like just fully formed, fresh body with black plated hair, some is up in the topk

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.420
not,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:19:00.980
 the others are coming down. And then we're, you know, wearing all kinds of, of garlands of pearls

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:10.740
 and jewels and emeralds and tinkling bells and flower garlands and holding, you know, the copper

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:21.780
 curved knife with a Vajra handle in our right hand up, and then the skull cup full of, you know,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:29.490
 ambrosia in our, in our right hand, and then sometimes with the Dhammaru. And then with the Katv

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:29.860
anga.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:39.700
 And so we are clothed in a way, of course, it's not customary. But I think a point here too is

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:49.700
 remembering there's as far as even as far as cultures go on the common everyday level.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:57.300
 There's all kinds of customs of what's appropriate or inappropriate in human culture,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:05.700
 you know, and this is in no way to kind of denigrate whatever any, any individuals kind of

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.300
 what's acceptable for them. That's not the point here. The point is remembering,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:18.580
 as far as human culture goes, there's all kinds of different customs of what's acceptable or

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:27.540
 unacceptable. From acceptable being completely covered, or, you know, just the top covered or

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:35.060
 just the bottoms covered, there's all kinds of permutations. But here, we're not so much,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:42.930
 we're, we're within our own practice, out kind of standing in our formal practice on the inner

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.140
 level,

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:50.900
 connecting with our inner innate qualities. So here, naked means

00:20:50.900 --> 00:21:03.200
 uncontrived, uncovered, fully revealed, you know, and that that's beautiful, that that's nothing

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.380
 but

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:14.820
 immense wisdom, compassion, big, full, pervading bodhicitta, completely realized and fulfilled.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.900
 That's what we're talking about here when we're connecting with kind of being naked.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:29.140
 It's just that uncontrived nature and that our body itself, right, no matter what, even if we are

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.500
 wearing clothes, we're always naked under our clothes, we come into the world naked.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:45.380
 So to answer the question quickly, the answer is yes, do what you're comfortable with,

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:52.260
 you know, we don't want to be blocking our practice by feeling uncomfortable and as we become more

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:59.120
 familiar, keeping open. But again, the instructions are here for a reason, and reading about the

00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.460
 deeper

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:06.820
 can really be helpful in connecting with why we're doing what we're doing. So like definitely

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:17.380
 Rinpoche's go over in illuminating the path in the chapter on Guru Yoga, what this symbolizes,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:24.500
 you know, so that why with our bodhicitta, with our closeness feeling, with our devotion,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:30.980
 we can connect with why the symbols are there, they're there to reveal

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:39.220
 and connect us within our direct perception to our own Buddha nature and bring out our bodhicitta.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:53.780
 So I hope that was somewhat clear. But yeah, so around that is do what you're comfortable with,

00:22:53.780 --> 00:23:01.140
 but then to truly remember that and then what even our body itself in this pure view

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:09.060
 is all the elements that make up the body are the five wisdom dakinis, the five wisdom mothers,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:19.300
 all the the aggregates, all the the components that make up our experience are the five wisdom

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:25.380
 fathers, you know, the five aggregates, the five elements, just that pure view, there's nothing

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:34.660
 outside of the true nature. We're just trying to realize for ourselves, that true nature,

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:42.740
 by these skillful means we've been given. But again, according to our capacities, according to,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.100
 you know, each one of us needs to

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:55.540
 kind of work with what we're truly comfortable with. But definitely remembering we're trying

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:05.780
 to move beyond our limited perceptions and things. And of course, on the common level of everyday

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:13.300
 human affairs, being sensitive to what's appropriate or inappropriate for ourselves

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:19.860
 and for others is very, very much part of our practice as well. So that's good. And then

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.140
 I'm trying not to talk too much today. So we have more time for practice.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:35.780
 The other question here was around, you know, as we know, with the guru yoga we're doing here,

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:42.180
 we're mostly concentrating on our, the three main chakras, our crown chakra,

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:51.940
 which is white, and we can mark more connected with the own. And then the throat chakra is ruby

00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:01.860
 red, and the heart chakra, the sapphire blue home. So of course, in the in the teachings,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:08.420
 there's many chakras, sometimes there's, we're not focusing just on the these three, sometimes

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:14.260
 we're also doing five. Sometimes there's more chakras. And then essentially, our whole body is

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:21.140
 made up of chakras, what are what the junctures of where our winds are flowing. But again, here,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:27.940
 there's a reason Guru Rinpoche gave us this skillful means that we're just focusing on these three.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:36.340
 Here, the person's asking if there was a syllable for the yellow golden light in the navel. And so

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:43.540
 I'll just say for now, definitely, there's so many instructions. But that's not necessarily part of

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:51.060
 these instructions. So definitely, you can find out more about that. But regarding the nundra

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:57.300
 practice here, just following this, these instructions is perfect and wonderful, you know,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.940
 as well as so are all the others, but we won't do that.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.260
 So again, all the Buddhas up to three times,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:16.340
 all the Arhats, all the Bodhisattvas, all the Shravakas, all the Prajekka Buddhas,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:23.140
 all the ordinary beings kind of just coming on the path, any good qualities they have, of course,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.980
 is because of relying on their teacher.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:37.540
 They all had teachers. Even in the common level, we've had teachers.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:46.740
 Our first teachers are our parents. So just connecting with the teacher is so vital,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:54.100
 so beautiful, so important. Why again, we're bringing they show us that's just like we say

00:26:54.100 --> 00:27:01.780
 in this in our lineage prayers, you know, in the palace of the ogman dhammadhatu, you know,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:14.420
 in the vast limitless space, basic space of all phenomena, you know, in that great palace,

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:23.060
 the embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times is our root teacher, the one who shows

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:30.180
 clearly the Dharmakaya of our own mind, our own mind, which isn't anywhere else.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:37.620
 That we aren't somehow separate from our mind here direct shows us the Dharmakaya,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:44.580
 the great uncontrived vast openness of our mind, inseparable from all appearances and awareness.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:51.780
 That's the precious teacher that we should always, you know, in the instructions. Of course,

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:58.580
 that's why guru yoga is so essential embodies all the practices. It's so vital, so important.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:06.660
 Keeping our our teacher just like it says on the crown of our head with appreciation, joy,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:12.580
 bodhicitta is great. And again, not just when they're giving us teachings,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.860
 not just when they're giving us some nice gift, not just when we're in trouble,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:26.260
 but like really always keeping the teacher in our mind and heart because they why not as some

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:33.300
 celebrity, you know, event or fixation, but because they're truly precious

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:42.820
 and showing us our own basic goodness and peace and helping us in our unique relationship to

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:49.140
 remove our obscurations and our habitual patterns that through which we cause trouble for ourselves

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:56.020
 and others and bringing out our beautiful nature. So again, that's all I'll say for today. And now

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:01.860
 we'll we'll get to doing the practice. So I hope that's somewhat helpful. And I was somewhat clear

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:09.060
 and not too meandering and wandering. And I'm sure I left things out. And my apologies if I've

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:16.660
 said anything totally incorrect or confusing. But again, please feel free to write if anyone

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:22.740
 needs has other questions or clarifying questions. It's helpful, because we're all here practicing

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:29.700
 together. And we have such a great body of teachings that we've heard or read or practicing.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:36.260
 And so in a way, it seems like a really effective use of our time together on this level of

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.100
 contemplation is kind of knowing what people are interested in or wondering about things like that.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:50.660
 So thank you. Now we'll begin our neutral practice. Again, we'll just do a minute of silence.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:30:00.260
 And we've, we've, I think, we've connected with the lineage. So we'll recite the seven line prayer.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:07.140
 And then with that, just knowing Gurumpushe embodies all the Buddha's of the three times. And

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:13.380
 then we'll go from seven line prayer right to our neutral practice itself. Okay,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:21.780
 since we've done all of our formal lineage.
