00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 (5) Don't rely on the person, rely on the teaching;

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:19.660
 (6) don't rely on the person, rely on the Dharma.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:45.500
 (5) Don't rely on the words, rely on the meanings, rely on the interpretable meaning, rely on the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.940
 definitive meaning or the ultimate meaning, and that is the third.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:01.520
 And the fourth meaning, the Four Reliances, is not relying on the conceptual level, relying

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.380
 on the wisdom, the ordinary or the wisdoms.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.780
 Those are the Four Reliances that the Buddha taught, that we should rely on to that one

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 after another, as it says.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.940
 First, relying not to the person, but relying on the teachings, or the Dharma, for the teachings.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 And that, for example, we cannot rely on the person, the person that can be a bit, kind

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.460
 of like, very beautiful and very kind of handsome, very nice, very beautiful-speaking, but if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.020
 the teaching is not correct, teaching is not right, we are not going to rely on every looking

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 for the enlightenment, every looking for the true realization, then we should not rely

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.900
 on the individual, in the persons.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.140
 And that is then, in the great Master Mahārāja said, and as well as there is also many of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.180
 these stories, even many times, that those bad persons can appear as beautiful persons,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.220
 beautiful persons, and will trick, trick, trick, and take advantage, therefore relying

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 on the teaching, not with persons, persons, persons.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.060
 And then, if the person looks like, if he is not that great, not that beautiful, not

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.940
 that nice looking, but if teaching is good, then that's fine, that is what we should do.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.740
 And for example, 18 times, those great Masters, such as 84 Masters, many of them, they are

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.780
 very, kind of, like, different looking, not officially as, like, monks or the nuns looking,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.020
 but very different looking, but when you have that, and those great Masters do contradict

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.620
 those, then it is the teaching.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.460
 For example, Telubavas, what's called the Telubavas feature, they call it external levels, but

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.740
 not over-contracted, and teaching, that is what you need, you need.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.940
 So therefore, and, and, so therefore, relying on the teaching, not on the persons.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.180
 And then teaching, not relying on the words, but relying on the meanings, when it comes

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.900
 to teachings, what the teaching is explaining, what is teaching to us, the meaning of that,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.580
 even though it's not really very poetic, it's very kind of like, nice rhythms and all that,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.660
 but if we explain the teaching perfectly, it has the meaning, that's what we want.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.700
 For that reason, then we could rely on the meaning, not the structure of the word, or

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.180
 not the sentence, and not the work of the Lord of what it is.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.620
 So therefore, we should rely on the meaning of the teachings.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.900
 And then when we rely on the meaning of the teachings, in the Buddha's teaching, generally

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.460
 there's two meanings, two-three teachings, those are known as the, as I translated that,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.260
 I think, the interpretable meanings and the definite meanings.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.620
 Interpretable meaning is something that Buddha used as the most kind of metaphors, metaphors,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.500
 but it means something, that, so we're not just going to take that immediately, what

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.220
 as metaphor says, says, but we take that, what the meaning, behind the meaning of that.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.940
 And then, for example, maybe roughly example, one of the Buddha's teaching, in the Vinaya

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.340
 teaching, said, Buddha said in Vinaya teaching, sun is shining, the crows are barking, crows

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:04.060
 are but, crows calling, crows are calling, palmars blowing, robbers crying, crying, crying,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.480
 it is time to wake up, that's what Buddha said, for example.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:17.700
 So what means, sun is shining, of course it also means that too, but means, what means

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:26.900
 Buddha came in this world, the teaching is willingly glowing as the sun, sun, that's

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.340
 what it means.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.100
 And crows are calling, that Vinaya practitioners are getting up early in the morning, they're

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:45.020
 joining sutras, they're joining mantras or sutras, sutras, in Vinaya teachings, a memorizing

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:57.220
 counter-ability, that is what means, it exactly means crows are crowing, crowing, and robbers

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.420
 are crying, what that means, it, robbers crying means, when you practice immeditating, all

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:15.580
 those negative emotions are crying, negative emotions are leaving, leaving, and that's

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:26.140
 what means, robbers are crying, and the palmars are blowing, what that means, palm blows means,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:34.260
 all those intelligent person, devoted person, do not meditate activities, plant seeds of

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:41.860
 enlightenment, plant the seed for benefit to all the beings, that's what it means.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.380
 So therefore, this is just a roughly example of the interpretable meanings, and then there

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.900
 is also other teachings sometimes said, for example, ancient time Buddha said, ancient

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:01.940
 time when I've become the Buddha Verojana, I did these things, but it didn't mean exactly

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.580
 that Buddha become the Buddha Verojana at the beach in the teaching set, those great

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.980
 masters mentioned, all the material in the singers, it didn't mean exactly that he become

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.300
 the Buddha Verojana, but it means the realization of Buddha Khatam himself and Verojana is same,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.220
 therefore he just used that metaphor, he used that language, it didn't mean exactly, exactly

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:37.100
 that, those are all known as interpretable meanings, and it definitely meanings, then,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.220
 so therefore, not relying on the interpretable meaning, but relying on the meaning of the

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:50.940
 definite meanings, definite meaning is then, is the Thagatagarbha, Thagatagarbha is a definitely

00:07:50.940 --> 00:08:00.540
 meaning, there's nothing to change, and the true nature is free from all the complexities,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:08.540
 that is definite meanings, poem is emptiness, emptiness is a poem, that is a definite meanings,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:15.900
 there's nothing going to change, anything about that, those are known as definite meanings,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.220
 but in the realization of this definite meanings, then, in the teaching set, we should not rely

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:32.860
 on the conceptions, but relying on the verses, conception can change, when it comes to realization,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:43.260
 conception is temporary, conception is impermanent, conception is as subject of the deceiving

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.140
 states,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:50.420
 change, but the wisdom, realization of the wisdom, that is what we should rely on, that, so

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.260
 therefore,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.340
 with the understanding of the definite meaning, stay with that conception, let that conception

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:06.220
 transform into the wisdom, that is the one you said, so here, with this intelligence of the fourth

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:15.740
 reliance, yes, those individuals, fortunate individuals with intelligence of the four reliance,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:25.230
 and then, then, then, searching and gathering the profound meaning of the lineage of the Vidyadhar

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.420
as,

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:33.900
 that, that is what we all need, fortunate persons, beings should do that, otherwise intellectual or

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:42.620
 those skeptical persons, whatever people say, should say, we should not, should not accept that,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.460
 should not, should not accept it, not should, because it will dilute us, it will deceive us,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:56.540
 it will make this appointment us, it will make us failures, failures of our journeys and spiritual,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:04.620
 that is what we need, therefore, that is what we need, but however, in the Vidyadharasian time,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:13.020
 Vidyadharasian time, and Vidyadharasian times, the words are, the wisdom in the joy efforts are

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.820
 weak,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:22.220
 and then, as well as married, and also small, and there is also many great masters that,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.260
 or the spiritual friend, who had a part of realization of the true nature, and then,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.300
 Prabhupada started speaking their own interpreting, their own way, interpreting,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:40.220
 own way, that has become more and more, and even practicing, and that is also diluted by our own

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:49.420
 consumption, and it becomes same as, like, the murk, murk in the markets, murk in the market means,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.220
 in India that happened, I'm sure it's happened in Italy too, but in Italy they don't have many

00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:00.620
 markets, so it's all kind of hunger, or at least in our area, we don't have any markets to sell,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:08.300
 but in India, because you have to buy the murk, murk, and because the seller of the murk, murk

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:17.580
 always put a lot of water, a lot of water, water in their brain, so then, when I'm young, young,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:25.100
 I see, in India they have a machine, what's called, their special machine, or special kind of small

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:32.220
 bottle, to take out how much water inside, and then they want a kilo, but he bought that,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:40.380
 he bought that, and one, that man, he always sells the murk, every day, one day, he showed that,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.420
 and he asked to pull murk, and he said, he said, this man said, what is this? He says, I like to

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.020
 see

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:54.460
 how much murk and how much water is inside, so he put the murk in that side, a small glass jar,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.860
 something, and then it said something, but I think it's really not really accurate, exactly,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:08.140
 but who says kind of, so I don't know what result can be got, but they have that, so that's what he

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:16.620
 said, so murk, I say like, murk in the market, market, it become weaker and weaker, more diluted,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:23.580
 and then that becomes more and more water, water, so even these teachings that come in happening

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:30.860
 that again and again, many times, and to make that, to understanding, or to the knower of that,

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.850
 is the teachings are diluted, that is also very rare, who can know that, exactly that, and

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.420
 therefore,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:46.140
 and so it becomes very, can be diluted, and then the teachings are very profound, and the teachings

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.950
 are very special, but however, sometimes also it's difficult to understand immediately what it

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:52.460
 means,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:59.500
 so therefore, and then also there is very many less people that who have the joyful effort,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.660
 can kind of examine, analyze, and then kind of like bring a more flavor of that teaching, also

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:18.140
 become small, and then as well as even though this

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:30.060
 and then those intellectual person who don't have the really understanding of the meaning of the

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:37.580
 particular teaching itself, and what they were explaining that, even though it is contrary to

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:45.260
 the ultimate meaning of the teaching, but however, people won't understand exactly that, can you

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.340
 see

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:53.140
 the difference of that, and then you are immediately kind of accepting as it is, and they used an

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.580
 example

00:13:53.580 --> 00:14:02.700
 as in Tibet, they use an example, this is quite large, and an example as a dog getting piece of

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.420
 long,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:16.540
 that's it, right? Long, L-L-U-N-E, because dog don't kind of can make the striking beat, but

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:25.580
 real meat and piece of long, long, long, or piece of organ or long, long, and they accepted that,

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:31.980
 immediately accept that, and it's so similarly, similarly people kind of don't understand sometimes

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:38.220
 what the teaching really is, and what is diluted and accepted, and then it just becomes very

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:50.860
 difficult to understand, how to counter it won't make exactly that difference, and therefore,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:58.860
 even though if they know the powerful meaning of the teaching, but there is very rare,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:07.500
 it's quite rare, people will kind of accept that and join and happy with that, so therefore,

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.860
 it's difficult, I mean, there's very rare or very small amount of people that can benefit

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:25.420
 for that reason, and why I should bother to write these things, even though that is, but however,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:33.500
 even that is so, but however, in this end of the degeneration, this teaching maybe could help

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:48.540
 for that reason, with good heart, and then I will explain the powerful meaning of the teaching or

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:48.780
 the

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:55.410
 very difficult point of the meaning of the teaching, as I receive the teaching from the holy llamas

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:55.420
,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:02.540
 and as well as from the scripture, for the kindness of the scripture and holy llamas,

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:12.700
 whatever I realize and understand, I will make this small, I will make a condensed way to

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:20.620
 explaining of this meaning of the nuxi, or new meaning of the ordinary nature of the mind, or

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:29.260
 fundamental mind that I will explain, so that is the what Mohoramaji is making, that overview of

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:36.460
 all these teachings, and as well as the importance of the teachings, and the importance of how to

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.780
 accept the teaching, and make that something really different, is when the rare teaching

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.500
 comes, where teaching is available, we should always accept that, with joyfully, with graciously,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:17:01.100
 within, full of devotions, that is the what I explain. Now,
