00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Thank you everyone. Thank you again for coming. Thank you everyone. Thank you.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Now we are again following the teachings of the Bodharsha Community.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 The greatest teachings of the Bodharsha Community are a variety of teachings, African Enlightenment

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.000
.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 From the age 35 to the age 82. And all those teachings are summarized in those nine vehicles.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 And those are everything that leads to the Enlightenment.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 There's no difference. Everyone brings a score on their goal or what they want to score.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 In the context of love and kindness, compassion, joy and peace, happiness.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And today we are following one of the highest teachings.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 That means the most direct teachings that will reverse our energy and nature.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 In a short period of time, without too much difficulties,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 we put the joy of effort, courage and commitment.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 That's what's called the highest teachings. It's more direct teachings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 These teachings are known as the inner tantra teachings.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And these inner tantra teachings are that, in the time of the Guru Prabhupada Sama,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 the great Master Shanti Deva, Shanda Rakita, and Kainthu Zoditti, were entirely these teachings.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 And it is filled with teachings.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 So many people are getting enlightenment, highest realization within their lifetime.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And that very teaching, that very practice we are following today,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 there's nothing really changed, nothing alternative.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 It didn't change by sentence, by sentence.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 It just maintained the same flavor, same blessing, same energy, same power.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Same thing maintained.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Every individualist keeps up that with joy and devotion, courage and commitment.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 That same teaching.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 25 disciples reaching enlightenment within their lifetime, that same teaching.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And all those great thetums become great thetums.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Why they become great thetums? Because they practiced.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 They activated their inner nature.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 They overpowered duality conceptions.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Defeat the notion of the samsara and nirvana in mental one status.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 There is no difference between death and birth.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Life is continuing.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 The emanations are continuing to benefit all living beings.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And how that happens, as I said, because of the practice, because of meditation.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 That same teaching, same practice, they continually maintain these great masters,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 these great practitioners and share it to us.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So today we are following that very powerful, profound, direct teachings.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And for that reason, again, bring more joy and devotion.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 There was all the tools to activating our realization.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Joy and appreciation, big grace force.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Being grateful to all the linear masters.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Being grateful for our situation and circumstances and what we have.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Toronto, happy with joy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And combine that joy and appreciation with the bodhicata.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 The vastness, motivation of the bodhicata.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Thinking all living beings, even every living being had the same calling

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 as the bodhicata, many of all those great masters, 25 disciples.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 But yet, they didn't recognize it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 They completely, we all deluded.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 We all mixed up there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 For that reason, great compassion.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Loving kindness, have great courage and commitment.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Determination that I like to have to all of them to reach, discover their innate natures.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And for that very reason, I'm going to practice.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 I'm going to manage it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I'm going to activate it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 I'm going to follow the path of exactly those great masters and become as they teach.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 They are our role models.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So vastness, motivation of the bodhicata.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Have that thought again.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Just bring up that, even for a few moments in the teaching, it's so important.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 At that moment, what we're doing, we're defeating the ego-clink, self-important attitude,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 and all the emotions are completely kind of put on the side of the disorder.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And we're completely kind of authentic, divine qualities of our innate glory of God, natures.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 That's wonderful.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 That's beautiful.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 With that thought, then we only understand.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 In another teaching, explain everything is enlightened status.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Everything is enlightened status.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Nothing is not enlightened status.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 But in Mahayana, Mahayoga teachings, or in other teachings,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 three various things, various forms, various forms, and various minds.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Bring up those realizations.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Or even your time.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Every kind of leaning of that thought, towards that duration,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 we're opening the window of the purity stage.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Not blocked by the duality, and the dark and hesitation, and kind of dilemma,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 and the darkness corners.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 We're lightening ourself.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Those are really important, according to you.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 With that, then we follow those all known as pandekya practices, particularly,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 in worldly citizen state.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And then we follow with this pandekya practice, according to hardness.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 There's, as I said earlier, there's general pandekya practices,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 and specifically, pandekya practices.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And so, we followed all of one another.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 We went through this today.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So what we did, according to sadhana,
