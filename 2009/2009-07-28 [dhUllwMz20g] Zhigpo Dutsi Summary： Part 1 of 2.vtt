00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 This is the teaching, and as we are looking back to the teaching itself, what the great master is

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.220
 supposed to say in this teaching, and that is, start Dzogchen practicing, because we are really Bod

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.000
hicata, and Bodhicata is the foundation of the Dzogchen practices.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.570
 Bodhicata is, again, as you all know, that is thinking of all beings, to have the two sentient

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 beings, to benefit the two sentient beings. That is what it is, it is compassion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And again, to do practice the compassion, and practice thinking of all sentient beings, then,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 instead of me, we should also ignore our self, or one's own self.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 If we want to help the two other beings, if we like to meet with the person, first, we have to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 click our self. We have to change our self.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.610
 Change is not going to start from outside, from others, and we are really thinking as practitioners

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.000
. Change must be started practicing its self, from individual self.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 That means, Bodhicata is not just focused outside, but focused with your self, through our self,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.910
 and how our negative emotions are developing, how it is expanding, how it is reducing, how it is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.000
 doing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 That is, we should look, read our mind, read our self, and that is what Bodhicata can be developed.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.210
 So Bodhicata practices not just start from outside, but start from in our heart, with our mind,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.000
 with your courage and your commitment.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.450
 Then, it is becoming true practitioners. Buddha teaching is observing in the heart, not going from

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 A to A, or from the right side A, and going to the left side of the ears.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.380
 It is really observing in the heart. That is what means. Resume the teaching, apply the teaching,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 and reflect the teaching.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 So that is what it means. When we have this beautiful root with both each other, let it shine below

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.000
 in our heart and mind, and then, let that shine to the others.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.530
 With that thought, and then also, we are not going to wait to shine this with each other, to our

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.000
 heart, to the others, and then in the second teaching of the kyokudas, what we say.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 Reflecting the impermanent. Impermanent is right with us. It's not just going to come in the future

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.000
.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.380
 It is here, it is always with us, and we should take every opportunity to actualize our self,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.000
 improve our self, and not waiting for some other things.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.680
 We have to apply now. That is also known as the very good practices. And we should always think,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.020
 reflect the teaching as much as you can, every day and every time, and thinking of this situation,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.000
 empowerment, and all of these things.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.190
 And time is precious. Everything is opportune. It's teaching said many times, and you all know, we

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.000
 all know.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.910
 This is everything is good state now. Everything is glory in beautiful status. And in 80%, the only

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.000
 85% is good with us.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.670
 We have every reason to be joy and happy, and appreciate, and we are going to use this time for the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.000
 good improvement, the good things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.730
 It's not going to stay forever with us. So therefore, sense of courage and commitment, and sense of

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.000
 practical, more kind of like don't to the earth, and then use this time and the situation.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:52.760
 That is the great Master Chapposite, said, reflected in harmony. With that thought, a strong sense

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.530
 of devotion, and joy and apprehension, all the time, kind of fill that richness, colleges, into the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 heart and mind.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.370
 That is the life necessary. All these thoughts. And with those all thoughts, really, in the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.000
 teaching said, terra bhuj, and terra bhuj.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.730
 That rata bhuj and bodhicata is combined with this earth, bodhicata is the time of the past, and r

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.000
ata bhuj is the second.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.730
 So when we do this, fill the presence of all the enlightened beings, vodas, bodhisattva, all of you

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.000
 are very much as in the teaching said.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.250
 Fill that presence with sorrow by all the enlightened beings, all of our hearts, the lineage of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.000
 Masters.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 In front of that, we are going to reflect the bodhicata, develop the bodhicata.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.430
 And in that, in close, we connect it to Vadadarma Sangha, and then do all the beautiful prayers of

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.000
 the bodhicata, and beautiful prayers of rafuj.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 That jaini is nothing but reflecting the meaning that what you meditate.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So meditation and jaini, inseparably, and do that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.190
 And finally, again, as my teaching said, as you all will know, then receive the blessings one after

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.000
 another.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And finally, all of those of you, rafuj, is dissolved.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.200
 Dissolved within the life, and then life is dissolved back to our heart center, with our mind, and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
 meditate in the natural state of the doctrine.
