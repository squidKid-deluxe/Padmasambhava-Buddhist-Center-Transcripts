00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.760
 Now I'll just talk a few words about what I've been discussing these last times, about the

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:23.580
 four causes that take rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha, Dewache, Tibetan, and Sakavati,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 all land of great blessfulness.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 We went four causes, which is the great Buddha, great teacher, explained in the Amitabha Sutra,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 the four causes, where he said, as I take that quotations, "Whoever thinks of Amitabha's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:04.120
 pure land as his future or his pure land, again and again," that is the one.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.640
 And the second is accumulating the merit, or gathering a lot of meritories.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 Second, third, that same sentence, "And bodhicitta, or thought of enlightenment with dedications,"

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 that's the third.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:37.680
 The fourth line, a continually same sentence, and he said, "And that person again and again

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:47.560
 praying that take rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha or Dewache, when that individually

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:58.840
 come to the end of the lives, that moment, everything, that person thinks of the Amitabha,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:08.800
 at that very instant moment, Buddha Amitabha and all the rationals, bodhisattvas say, welcome

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:17.400
 right in front of that individual on the prisons, right in front of that individual.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.040
 And when this individual see Buddha Amitabha and all the rationals, that individual be so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 relaxed and calm and peaceful, because that will have no fears or the suffering, the difficulty

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.400
 of the moment of death, and then take the rebirth immediately.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 As soon as we've lost the breathing, breathing, or last moment breathing, and rebirth in the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.680
 pure land of Dewache, and we will burn in the pure land of Amitabha or Sukhavati, those

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.080
 are the, what we make and discuss, kind of roughly making that.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.280
 So those are the four causes.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.400
 And we went kind of little details of the meditation or the field prisons of Amitabhas,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.960
 pure land, and as well as Amitabha, and two principal disciples, such as Awalakrithyora

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.680
 and Vaidyapani, right side, and Awalakrithyapani.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.320
 So right side, the chin is Awalakrithyora, left side is Vaidyapani, and all the bodhisattvas

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.120
 all that is the bodhisattvas, and they're living in Buddha right now.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.480
 As I said, according to Dewache's time or the pure land of Amitabha at the time, Buddha

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.160
 Amitabha got enlightenment ten years, ten days ago, ten days, according to their standard,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 ten days ago.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.600
 So he's living in Buddha right now.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.140
 And Buddha Amitabha, and all the chin is Awalakrithyora, and Vaidyapani, the bodhisattvas, this bod

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.600
hisattva

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.280
 is really looking to us with eye of comparison, love to all the living beings, moment we think.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.160
 Buddha Awalakrithyora is also a lord of the, lord of the families of so many Buddhas, such

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.040
 as Tara, Awalakrithyora, Guru Pehman Sambog, one of the great master, Karma Chami said,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.880
 in the right hand, Amitabha's right hand emanated so many emanations of the, so many emanations

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.000
 of the chin is Awalakrithyora to benefit for all beings.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.080
 And the left hand of the Amitabha emanated so many, many Taras to benefit to all the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.480
 sentient beings.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.800
 In the Heart, from Heart Center Amitabha emanated so many emanation of Guru Pehman Sambog to

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.520
 benefit for all sentient beings.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.160
 So therefore, Amitabha is a lord of the source of all the Buddha families, particularly the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.960
 Pema families.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.600
 And so that is what really fills the strong presence of the Buddha Amitabha right in front

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 of us.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.040
 And then do the Akumalayhi merit, whatever we do, Akumalayhi merit is not something big

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.760
 things, Yagantakthi things have to do.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.280
 One of the great teacher, Buddha Shaktamuni said to Ananda, Ananda, his disciple, Ananda,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.920
 raise up from the cushion, looking forward in the west direction, hold the flower, throw

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.760
 that flower toward the right direction, thinking that I'm offering to the Buddha Amitabha.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.280
 Amitabha, thinking of that, it's you making great meritorious and will take the bird.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.280
 The simple flower, just a big flower from the ground, facing toward the west direction,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.800
 with the clear mind of the devotion, offer that.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.680
 And that is meritorious.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.640
 And when we do that kind of meritorious, may this become the cause to take rebirth in the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.840
 Pure Land Amitabha, myself and all the sentient beings, thinking of all the sentient beings

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.800
 is bodhicitta, we know.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.760
 And then what your meritorious activity or good deeds you do and others are doing, see

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.480
 that with rejoice and joyfully, may this become the cause to take rebirth to everyone in Pure

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.480
 Land.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.840
 That is the fourth cause, prayer again and again, to be born in the Pure Land Amitabha.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.720
 Those are the simple four causes and conditions to take rebirth in Pure Land Amitabha.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:48.680
 So this prayer of four causes, that small paper that we have, the praise, those two

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:56.000
 papers, I take two papers, you have that loose page, that is the praise, that is the praise,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.160
 aspiration, praise.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:05.440
 We have to do that simple way in clear mind with bodhicitta, thought and whatever the offering

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.240
 you can do, mentally offerings or existing offerings, but open heart, open mind, those

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.840
 are the really in the teaching sense.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.280
 So I just thought, highlight that, we just don't have to think big things, it's simple,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.760
 short and easy, it's the way to reach, get really to this, what's called transform this

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.160
 samsara into the Pure Land.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.320
 And what in the great Master Raghaksa, just what we chided here.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.280
 By the merit of this meditation and recitation, and instantly when I lead this body, may I

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.360
 take the miraculous birth in the devotees of the Tibetan world by the land of blissful,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.080
 Amitabha Pure Land.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:54.680
 And there, may I complete all the 10 Bhoomis or five part 10 Bhoomis, fulfilling all the

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.640
 wishes and aspirations of bodhicitta completely fulfilled and then benefited for all the living

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 beings.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:08.360
 That's it, so it's fulfilling all the bodhicitta fulfillment, bodhicitta's wishes, our wishes

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.120
 very easily without so many challenges, difficult obstacles, all conditions.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.560
 So those are, I just thought to highlight that and that.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.840
 But then there is true obstacles to be born in the Pure Land Amitabhas.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:36.280
 That is again, if someone gives up the connection to the Dharma, then that individually will

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.040
 not be born in the Pure Land with Amitabha.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.000
 That is the one cause.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.040
 Second cause to prevent and take the birth in Pure Land is making big obscurations.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:57.120
 Those are the taking lives of the very close precious dear ones, such as in the teachings

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:07.160
 we said, taking lives of these life's parents, lives, and our precious kindness, teachers'

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:20.920
 lives, hurting the Buddhas and disturbing the dharmas and practice organizations, disturbing

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.520
 the intentionally.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:31.960
 Those are the two obstacles, if we do those obstacles, that will prevent to take the rebirth

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.120
 in the Pure Land Amitabha.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.040
 Otherwise, it's so simple, simple, easy, that because why?

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:48.280
 Buddha Amitabha promised that and committed, and the Buddha Shakyamuni reforced of that

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.780
 statement of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.680
 So that is what it is.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.000
 And I just thought to highlight that and thank you very much.
