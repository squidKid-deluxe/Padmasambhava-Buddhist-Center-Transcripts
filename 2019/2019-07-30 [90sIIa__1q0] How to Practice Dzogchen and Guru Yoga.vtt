00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Dzogchen, in the new month's teaching, they always summarize that. So I follow with that first

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.000
 steps.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 And that is what the great Master Dzung Timba said.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 If you keep these three principal nobles and put your practice within these three principal nobles,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 then all the practice comes so perfect, beautifully, it's going to make the fulfillment of it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Follow your wishes and help with the other things.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Those three nobles.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Our great Kiki Padhe Gerberji mentioned so many times, and so do I'm repeating those words,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 and not just also Kiki Padhe Gerberji said, but this is Dzung Timba's teaching,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 not just Dzung Timba said, but all the other great Master Dzung Timba said too.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And those are known as the beginning nobles, middle nobles, and concluding nobles.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And we have that noble good, beginning noble, middle noble, and concluding nobles.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Beginning noble is the foundation, foundation. That foundation practices.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.930
 Foundation, how we start foundation. So that means it has a head, it has a body, it has final

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.000
 accomplishment.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So then whole package, whole practice comes perfect.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 The beginning noble or the first noble foundation is the motivation.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 With the motivation, taking the rough, developing the body together.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.190
 At the same time reflecting the four thoughts, as I said the other day, and you all know four

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 thoughts.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 We did four thoughts and filled strong presence of the Murugan Masambhava Buddha,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 all the religious masters. Really it's strong, immensely devotions, joy, and appreciations.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Appreciations, inside reference, develop the body together.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Even though we already may be talking about the body together, but activating the body together.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And follow the instructions.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Since you are practicing, if you are practicing, there is prayer.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 Join those prayers. Those prayers are not just that you are joining, but you are reflecting meaning

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.000
 to the heart.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Meaning to the heart is in a way reminding of what you are going to activate in your heart.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Not what you say, but what you are going to activate in the heart.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Rapho and Bodhijal. So that is the beginning.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And I am making those already, and you know already, it's not something I am talking to you.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 The Middle Noble is the principal part of the practices.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 With that virtual motivation as a foundation, now you begin the practices.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Practicing is what F.S. can't wait to spoke, as his own union, according to his teaching,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 we spoke about the zukti teachings.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.140
 But if he is practicing zukti practices, I will say in here, he is going to say, do guru yoga

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.000
 practices.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Some guru yoga practices, if you have time, if you have practice, a bundle of practices,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 do those bundle of practices. It's not that long.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 This is the bundle of practices. A bundle is so condensate.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.290
 For example, each of those, three times, three times, in the presence of Rapho Ditri, or the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.000
 enlightenment.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Three times, three times, times, after, then came to the guru yoga,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and giant those pray, short pray in the second of earth, that giant three times,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 and additionally giant three times, seven line prayers. Seven line prayers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Feel the stone presence of Gurbian Masambha, and the stone devotions.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And Gurbian Masambha import him into all the Buddhas, dharma, sangha,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 of all the times, and ten directions.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Really, that means, Gurbian Masambha's embodiment, loving kindness, compassion, versatile power,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 of all the enlightenment, came in one single state as Gurbian Masambha.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Gurbian Masambha transcendent, there was the rainbow body of love and compassion and vastness.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And radiating that power and energy, light, to all the beings,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 and particularly how that light is coming to you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And how your body, your channel, wind, essence, element, or vital essence,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 all completely blisses, with that, and then of the same time,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 with the stone, again the connection, giant three times, seven line prayers.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Afterward, you giant, then, maybe every time,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 one mala of the mantra of Gurbian Masambha, otherwise, maybe 21 times, whatever you think.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And during that, toward the end, so many blisses, lights coming from Gurbian Masambha,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 white light, red light, blue light, in the multiple light,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 one after another coming to you, and it's completely blessed,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 and completely blessed, the entire universe, and all every living beings.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 It means, finally Gurbian Masambha dissolved into the light, and that merged to you,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 or came to the pramukaram chakra, to the center of the channel,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 and merged to your heart center, merged with your own awareness.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Rupa tumbak, raktumba, clear light luminosity state of your own Rupa state.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Merged inseparable. Now, and now you do the Jogji meditation, as we were.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Relaxing that status, rest in that status, five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 During that time, it's a little bit difficult to stable, mind is not staying, maybe you're

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 concentrated.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Do the concentration meditation for maybe two, three minutes.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Concentrate into the object. Concentrate into the light, in the mental income,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 where you're like, oh, breathe, oh, that information.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Concentrate the breathing, oh, maybe five minutes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 That will tame the mind, brain. It will tame the mind.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And do that, that. And then again, do the Jogji.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 What is Jogji meditation? Jogji meditation is, again, we make it many times.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Times, but it's generally what I'm teaching, it is vipassana. Jogji is vipassana.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 But when we discuss where we're going to do that vipassana,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 we're not going to see all this emptiness, outside everything is empty.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 You don't have to think that everything is empty.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Just look to your mind. Look to your mind.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 This is the famous direct assuring world, that assuring to the true nature status.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That world, W-O-R-D, the world. It's assuring.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 I think in Zen teaching, what do you call it? It's the same. It's powerful.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Look to your mind. You can even ask, what is mind, where is mind?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 If you ask that question to yourself and look to the mind,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 what are we going to find? There's nothing to find.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 It's totally clear, clear.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And in the teachings, say luminous cities, in the Jogji teachings, luminous cities.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 It's not blank, clear. How that luminous city and the empty is.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 I use it always as an example, I thought that's kind of good.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 In the autumn morning, clear autumn morning, when the sun comes,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 in the sky, the dawn comes in the sky.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 What the sky is loose, completely brilliant, open, and vast, and spacious.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 But there's nothing to walk.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That is, maybe go quite close examples of this clear, light luminous city

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 of the great vastness and emptiness of the river.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Relax in that status.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 When you see that, or when you behold that or see that, that is supreme seeing.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 There's nothing further to go.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And we're trying to go further than that.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 We are manipulating by conceptions.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 It is conception, then.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Conservation is known as duality.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And then we spoil the nature with it is.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Relax in that status.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 How you're going to relax? Relax in body, relax in energy,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 relax in wind, and relax in mind is on that nature of status.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 That is jocchi teaching.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 We went through this, went through this, and that is jocchi teaching.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So two practices. Practice that state as long as you have time.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 As I said, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or whatever you have time.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And when you feel that, then that counts as the third novel.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 So beginning novel, middle novel, and third novel.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Third novel is known as aspiration or aspiration and dedication.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Aspiration and dedication.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 If I say simply what that means, aspiration and dedication is no other than it is bodhicitta.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Again, bodhicitta.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Kindness compared for all living beings.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 I practice it for this half an hour or 20 minutes or whatever that,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 when I do whatever I want, any merit or whatever,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 may it become the great cause and the condition to bring joy and peace,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 harmony, award, peace, peace, and then balance the environment,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 and really wish strongly that in heart, and then dedicate that merit.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And for all living beings without any exceptions or without any discriminations.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 So that means good wish and sharing your merits with them.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 That is known as the ending novels.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Beginning novel, middle novel, concluding novels.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Then your practice becomes full circle, completely novel.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Novel, and then your meditation is complete, your practice is complete.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Now you walk into the world. All involves meditation.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Again carry love and compassion, bodhicitta, thought, all living beings,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 and see all this is like beauty instead of you can.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Otherwise, all this meditation, all this dream like that, have that realization.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 And this is reality, this really dream.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Because even that novel we understand, the contents are discovered.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 It's all a magic, all a dream, all energies.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 That's what in the Buddha's teachings he said,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 all these dreams, all these magic like, all these rupalaki moon in the water legs,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 all these mirage like.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Those, the British comparative teacher use the matter of terminology to bring this realization

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 of this way things are on the relative truths.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And then perform the good activities according you can do.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And hold that as we discussed yesterday or that, the conduct.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Follow the conduct, nice. Good is good, bad is good on the relative level.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Follow those things. And trying to do good things, trying to avoid bad things.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And good and bad also start from the, again from the heart.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 When our heart is good, it's good.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 The heart is bad or negative, it's bad.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.680
 That's a symbol, that's good. And every kind of key word that is known as Buddha's teaching is good

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.000
 practices.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And your practice, you're improving, you're benefiting to the others and benefiting to yourself.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 So that is my brief talk for today and thank you very much everyone again.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Thank you for coming and the body is spreading.
