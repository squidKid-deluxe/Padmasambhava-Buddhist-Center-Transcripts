00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.730
 We practice the Dzogchen, then we follow such as the great teacher, Garab Dorje. There's nothing

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.400
 higher than the Dzogchen practice than the Garab Dorje.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.520
 There's no higher Dzogchen practice and reliable beings than the Garab Dorje.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.980
 Garab Dorje is his own work, his own teaching. He said only to practice Dzogchen should have the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 Kundal, the foundation practices, that is, bodhichitta and reflecting the impermanence.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.970
 That's what Garab Dorje said. That means Dzogchen practice should be practical, more drawn to the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 earth, not hovering in the space all the time.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.200
 You have to be drawn to the ground. Bodhichitta means touch to the heart, the basic phenomenal

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 systems.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:04.810
 Even Dzogchen is, like I said, king of the creation center, Gomhsi Gyapot Center mentioned there's

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.960
 ten different nothing.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.080
 There's no meditation. There's nothing to be preserved Samaya. There's nothing to be observed in

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.960
 the congregate.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 One after another there's ten different status. Nothing, nothing, nothing. None of those exist.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.240
 None of those exist.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 Those are mentioned, but those are mentioned only on the absolute level, the absolute level, only D

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.120
zogchen, Dzogchen's own, its own natural status.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:38.610
 As long, or until we got that realization, exhaled as it is, we have to be mumbled, we have to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 observe, and we have to be practical in the phenomenon of all.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.800
 Where we belong, where we act, we have pain, we have suffering, we have emotions.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.590
 Even as we have to deal with that, we can apply and bring Dzogchen right there, there, and ignore

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.920
 everything. That won't work for us.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 We cannot be as kind of an out-order person. And so therefore, again, we have to be more practical,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.120
 we have to be more sympathetic, and we have to be more reasonable.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.880
 And for that reason, the great Master, Dzogchen, both each other and reflect the impact.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.780
