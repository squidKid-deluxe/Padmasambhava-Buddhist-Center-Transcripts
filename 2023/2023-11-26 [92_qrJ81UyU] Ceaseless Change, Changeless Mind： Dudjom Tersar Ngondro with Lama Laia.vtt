00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820
 Again, as that ever-turning wheel of Dharma is turning and shining like a brilliant sun

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 through the beautiful wisdom and compassion of our precious teachers, equally, you know,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.140
 let our heart's inspiration, you know, turn and flow. And so again, as we begin anything

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:36.660
 within the beautiful transcending loom of our practice of study, contemplation and meditation,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 connecting with these elements of, you know, our, you know, re-settling into our core motivations

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.860
 and core practice of our renunciation, our joy, devotion. And then as much as that, really,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.020
 the big cause for enlightenment, thinking of enlightenment itself, and sincerely wishing

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:13.900
 for ourselves and every living being to attain the state of liberation and true peace. And

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.940
 then as much as we can connect with our deep trust and confidence in the true goodness

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.220
 qualities of every aspect of reality.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:11.540
 And so before our practice time today, we have this little time to kind of reflect on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 the teachings. And of course, the whole point of reflecting on the teachings is to soften

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.860
 up our minds and hearts and really connect clearly with our mind and our heart with our

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:38.240
 practice. And like, you know, all the great masters have told us, given us some lots of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.780
 homework to do, but definitely in said again and again, in order to really realize our

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.460
 own potential, the really beautiful potential of this truly precious human birth with all

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:03.740
 the freedoms and endowments, in order to realize that potential, we really shouldn't dawdle

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.440
 or hover, you know, in, you know, kind of the state of not really examining our situation

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.740
 further. So of course, there's looking at our precious human birth, all its freedoms

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:29.900
 and endowments. The other thing that kind of really can block us from realizing our

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.100
 potential is really not looking clearly at impermanence. So right, that's our second

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:45.520
 thought that turns the mind toward the Dharma, you know, helps us move past our assumptions

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.580
 and kind of unrealistic expectations towards not only to see what they are, but see how

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.820
 they don't really hold up under investigation, and also naturally turn our mind towards what

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:09.180
 is reliable, which is ever presently there as a support, which is what? Nothing but our

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:18.140
 true nature, right? And so impermanence, even in the time we have, we're, we're giving just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.820
 a certain amount of time to talk about this. So it's a really big, big subject. But I guess

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.560
 my point is, I'll talk a little bit about, you know, kind of reviewing, not just, of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.500
 course, it's not just my thoughts, but these are the, what has been handed to us by all

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.140
 the great lineage masters, you know, in our beautiful lineage as a framework for each

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:50.220
 one of us, myself, you, all of us, to really investigate and do these contemplations. So

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.540
 kind of, I think I'm just going to really for time's sake, go over the main framework

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.180
 that we're given according to the lineage, you know, according to like the lineage of

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.380
 Popto Rinpoche, Kempo Seibong Rinpoche, Kempo, Kempo Pauldenshire Rinpoche, Dodger Rinpoche,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:17.080
 just to name a few, right? So we've all heard and we've all seen to some degree, everything

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.300
 is impermanent. Nothing is permanent. And one of the main ways that can really hit us

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:35.300
 home is really realizing our own mortality, that each one of us is going to die. Each

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.980
 one of us will pass away, really feel that in our hearts, again, not just to be stuck

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.740
 there, but to just realize truly like deeply in our bones in our heart, that that's just

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.740
 a fact of life. And we have the beautiful Dharma and these other practices which are

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.940
 helping soften our assumptions that we're always going to be here. Things are always

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:12.980
 going to be the same to what's more true and more reliable for us to kind of rest our awareness

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.900
 and our experience within, right? So then within that, you know, the masters give us kind of

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:29.940
 these three main ways of just doing some investigation, each one of us. So there's just looking at

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:39.740
 the impermanence of the outer universe, you know, the universe in which each one of us

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:50.340
 exists or feel we exist and share. The impermanence of not only the outer universe in which we

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.820
 exist, but each one of us, the impermanence of ourselves and every being that exists in

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.420
 this world at this time, every being who's come before us, every being who will come

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:13.420
 after we're long gone. So the impermanence of all the beings who exist in the universe.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.060
 And that even though then, you know, the third really big homework is to really contemplate

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:29.780
 the impermanence of, or not the impermanence, but the uncertainty even of when we'll die,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.580
 we might know that we're impermanent and it might be obvious that we might die, but that

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:48.260
 we don't know when that will be, where it will be, how it will be. So as far as the impermanence

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:56.260
 of the outer universe, again, I don't have the time nor do I have the memory to go through

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:05.700
 every detail that the Buddha laid out in just how this, you know, the Buddha taught this

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:13.900
 universe in which we exist, that feel we exist in this moment. It wasn't always here. And

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.020
 the Buddha really lays out, you can find this like in words of my perfect teacher, in the

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.640
 commentaries on the word of my perfect teacher, in many different, you know, places, the

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.540
 description

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:36.300
 of just literally how this universe wasn't always here. And these in in between the moment

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:46.500
 of not being coming into existing, developing, kind of sustaining, decaying, and then just

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:55.820
 completely releasing into emptiness into space again, these immeasurably, I mean, inconceivable

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:04.260
 for us spans of time in which this whole universe has sprung into being and currently existing

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:11.940
 and will come to an end. It's like this world itself, this solar system, this planet, even

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.380
 if we're looking at the more kind of Western scientific vision wasn't always here. We weren't

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:30.140
 always here. And also, this solar system, this galaxy will at some point fall apart.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.140
 So the point here, the Buddha is really getting us that is to really look at these like think

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.540
 about it. But the real point, I think of the of really looking at the impermanence of the

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:49.500
 outer universe is not only is it just this universe, but all the infinite universes that

00:09:49.500 --> 00:10:00.300
 have ever sprung forth out of pure space. No matter how long they've existed, they all

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:17.820
 don't last forever. So within that, right, there's just even this, this world, our own

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:26.300
 little lives, it's just the twinkling of an eye. But again, not just thinking it, but

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.820
 I'm just trying to like, for myself, and hopefully you kind of kind of reflect a little bit on

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:50.780
 that. The impermanence of all we beings who exist in the universe. Again, all of us, no

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:59.260
 matter where, like the Buddha pointed out many times, we're all bound to die. You know,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:05.220
 like there's this, in one of the sutras where as a woman whose son has died, and she's asking

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.500
 the Buddha to please bring him back. And then he said, you know, you go to every house and

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:27.300
 ask if if anyone has ever not experienced death. So we're just really thinking about that.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:38.100
 Think about all those we've known in our lives who are gone. Think about all those who've

00:11:38.100 --> 00:12:00.460
 come before us who are gone.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:08.780
 Not only kind of we kind of more ordinary beings, you know, pass away, but even the great holy

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:22.900
 beings have passed away. Like even like all just think within this fortunate Kalpa, Buddha

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:32.140
 Shakyamuni came forth, but before him, other Buddhists have come. They've had whole retinues.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:38.340
 Their profound teachings have spread and been practiced, ripened many beings to, you know,

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:48.620
 our hood hood and bodhisattvas and onward. And nothing of their teachings remains, not

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:58.380
 to mention themselves in the ordinary sense. And then within this time of the teachings

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:08.180
 of Buddha Shakyamuni and the world, even Buddha Shakyamuni displayed Maha Parinirvana passed

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:18.100
 away. Thankfully those teachings remain. So many of the great masters, you know, who even

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:29.140
 had the power, you know, to turn fire into water, water into fire, walk through mountains,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:46.020
 you know, fly through space. They've all displayed passing on as well.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:54.700
 So the impermanence of ordinary beings, the impermanence of holy beings, the impermanence

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:06.420
 of powerful beings, such as like even the gods Indra and so on. Even the gods are subject

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:16.020
 to death. No matter how powerful, even within our humanity, these, you know, all kinds of

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:23.020
 great emperors and empires have come and gone, had great power and great renown. And now

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:42.020
 maybe there's so many that no one even knows the name of or maybe only the name of.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.460
 And of course, then there's also other, you know, ways that are maybe a little bit more

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.380
 direct for ourselves. Some of these are just kind of really looking in the vista, looking

00:14:52.380 --> 00:15:05.180
 in every direction, just seeing how impermanence, how everything is always changing, never stopping

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.180
,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:13.520
 here in an instant, gone in a flash, including other things we can look at, you know, such

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:24.900
 as looking at the seasons, looking at the minutes, one minute passes to the next minute, the

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:39.520
 hours go by, the sun rises, the sun sets, days go by, moons go by, years go by, life goes

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:58.360
 by, you know, like sands in the hourglass, so are the days of our lives. Our communities,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.880
 you know, you think of even within our own sangha or within our families, our neighborhoods,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.280
 our circles of friends and life, just looking at that, how much has changed from the times

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:18.160
 we were little kids up until teenagers, up until, I don't know, we're all at different

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:25.920
 stages of our lives, but, you know, the people who are around us and important at every stage

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:36.200
 of our lives, where are they now? And what are our relationships now? So looking just

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.280
 at that, just seeing like how much have just our own communities changed, like even within

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:52.040
 our own sangha right now, how many people who were here 5, 10, 2, 20 or more years ago,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:17:03.040
 how many are still with us? How many are, you know, being born too? And then our relationships,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:10.280
 the changeability of just our relationships, of like this, our situations with each other,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.440
 the ways in which we relate, relate to each other as friends, whether it's a friendly

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:27.440
 connection, trusting connection, or a more, you know, challenging kind of connection,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.880
 how much that can change. If we just think for ourselves, maybe people who we met and

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:38.750
 we had a lot of like hard knocks and misunderstandings and bumping up against each other and

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.760
 challenges

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.920
 with, you know, understanding and patience and all those things. And now who knows, we

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:53.000
 all think can know that that can easily change into deep, close, trusting appreciation and

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:04.280
 friendship. And likewise, it can go equally the other way to go from trusting, close relationship

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:21.880
 where we share a lot, and then things change. Good fortune can end in poverty. Poverty can

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.720
 lead to fortune. Everything's always coming, going, everything that comes together ends

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:35.160
 in separation. Everything built up will be dispersed. These are the truths, the facts

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:42.360
 of life, the teachers, the Buddha's pointed us towards. And then it's important to I think

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:51.640
 even within our own practice, we all experience change and impermanence and instability. We

00:18:51.640 --> 00:19:02.920
 can have really, really clear, lucid, heartfelt practice. We can have a practice session where

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:13.200
 it's very dull, heavy, uninspired. You know, so even within the continuum of our own practice,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:24.320
 we all firsthand experience those changes between clarity and confusion, trust and doubt, you

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:32.880
 know, lesser and greater degrees of joy, devotion, bodhicitta, you know, that's heart for it.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.880
 But the important part as practitioners, right, with all of this is we're looking at all of

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:48.440
 this and we're continuing to practice to reach what? To reach the changeless state, to reach

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:58.840
 what's true and beautiful, the holy dharma, you know, so just remembering too that the

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:08.740
 reason we're practicing is to move beyond samsara. With bodhicitta, of course, you know, not as

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:21.440
 an escape, but to recognize within all of this change, we need to witness that change.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.680
 We need to witness impermanence and kind of the unreliability of appearances as long as

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:36.320
 we have ignorance, hope and fear. And we need to keep practicing with our courage and commitment,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.840
 you know, because of course we all know it, but the more we look at these kind of facts

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:49.120
 and like the four thoughts, the more we have a heartfelt sense of our own mortality and

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:58.200
 how precious this moment is and of the inevitability of karma and really feel and see in our own

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:11.180
 direct perception how samsara is never perfect. So we're trying to move beyond samsara, turn

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:29.400
 our mind toward the dharma for that reason.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.600
 So like the Buddha said, it's very famous, we've said it many times, the beautiful quote

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:45.920
 of how the Buddha said, "Of all the footprints of the animals, the elephants is supreme."

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:59.280
 Of all the kind of mental investigations we could do, impermanence is supreme. The mighty

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.480
 giant elephant's footprint is the biggest, deepest mix, the biggest impression among

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:13.520
 all the animals and contemplating, investigating the truth of impermanence in every aspect

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.360
 of our lives. And again, not only having that be an intellectual thing, but feeling that

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:29.360
 truth is supreme, the Buddha said. That's why it's because it's pointing our mind towards

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:48.000
 the dharma, turning our mind towards the dharma.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.760
 So I thought, you know, maybe in another time we can look a little bit more at karma, how

00:22:52.760 --> 00:23:00.560
 karma happens, interdependence, but the point too, like Mipham Rinpoche says, and many again,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:11.200
 many of the great masters, our own precious teachers, turning our mind toward the dharma

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:20.440
 through the method of really seeing the reality to our own ordinary sentient being perception,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:27.220
 looking at impermanence is going to reveal to us, it's the doorway to having a direct

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:42.760
 perception of the great emptiness, the great emptiness, you know, that's beyond any conception,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:50.000
 the Dharmakaya state of our own mind, the nature of everything of all phenomena that

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:14.640
 appears, you know, like the Buddha says, you know, there's also a famous quote, like, clouds,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:28.000
 fire rings, etc. Thus are all compounded things, illusory, a web of interdependence. And when

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.120
 we look at interdependence, where does it begin? Where does it end? That we know we

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.240
 can look at another time. But the point here also is that I want to follow is that thread

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:48.440
 of how looking at impermanence can usher our minds into the direct perception to our ordinary

00:24:48.440 --> 00:25:00.000
 minds of the great emptiness. And then there's just a beautiful quote from the Buddha. That's

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.120
 along those lines of kind of the benefit. And we're looking here at the benefits of

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.840
 really taking to heart impermanence, starting to reveal to our ordinary minds, the great

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:21.040
 emptiness, the great Dharmakaya, ground, and our Buddha nature, right? So I'm reading this

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:29.920
 from Tinley Norbu's book, the Cascading Waterfall of Nectar, which is a commentary on the Dajam

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:40.080
 Tarasonundra, but he lists from the Sutra of Parinirvana. So from the Buddha. For whoever

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:49.680
 harvests fields, the best is to have found a field with crops. Among all impressions,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.120
 the best is the perception of impermanence and death. Why? Because the perception of

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:05.760
 the three realms will be diminished. Meaning that, obviously, like I think a lot of what

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.880
 I was just trying to go over, the more we look at the nature of it, the less we see

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.660
 it as being permanent, the less we see it as permanent, we realize the illusory nature

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:25.960
 of it all and kind of soften our assumptions and habitual patterns of thinking things are

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:35.320
 solid, permanent, independent. And then furthermore, he gives another quote from the Buddha from

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:42.900
 the Sutra of revealing the three Kayas. "Dharmakaya is the permanence of the essential nature as

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:55.400
 it is. Sambhogakaya is constant permanence. Narmakaya is uninterrupted permanence." Pointing

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:07.680
 our mind toward direct perception of the true nature of the three Kaya state. To the Dharma,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.720
 turning our mind towards the Dharma. So then I'll say there's another beautiful quote here

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:22.880
 from the Uttara Tantra. "The Lord of Dharma, the Dharma, annihilates the demon of death

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:36.520
 in permanence." Why? Because the Dharma is unborn and it is thus the permanent protector

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:55.560
 of the world. And then I'll just read one more from the Uma Jhukpa. "Body of peace, the wish

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:04.600
 granting tree, ever radiant, like a wish fulfilling jewel with no conception, permanently endures

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:15.920
 in this world until all beings are liberated." So again, we're just pointing out, the Buddha's

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:26.120
 pointing out, through really taking the heart in permanence, looking at change, looking at

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:36.560
 how everything is ceaselessly ceasing, always changing, never for an instant still in any

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:52.280
 way, be it form, perception, conception, etc. By really seeing that, feeling that, bringing

00:28:52.280 --> 00:29:02.240
 that home to our own fleeting life and never knowing for a moment when it will end, how

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.440
 it will end, where it will end, none of that's guaranteed. Really feeling that. Maybe even

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:16.440
 putting ourselves in situations where we feel that mortality. Not putting ourselves in danger,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:23.240
 but feeling that. Like for me, sometimes waking up early, early in the morning, where none

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:30.600
 of the usual is happening in those really special times before dawn, sometimes I really

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.920
 comes home to me then. I'm not saying that's the same for everyone. But don't shy away

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:45.040
 from it. Look for it. And again, think of our Guru, think of the undying, great, ever

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:53.320
 present, all transcending wisdom, compassion, love and blessings of the Buddha, of Guru

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:05.920
 Rinpoche, who are pointing out that same nature in our own mind and heart. Maybe I'll just

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.760
 stop my moment there. And again, all of this is just a little reminder for us each to kind

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.520
 of really not ignore what our teachers have been telling us. Really look at impermanence

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:25.560
 again and again and again and again, like they say. So we feel it, see it and help us

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:33.960
 again. Then look at karma and interdependence, which is totally reliant upon impermanence

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:41.200
 and the great emptiness state. We'll just be silent, just rest with that for a few moments

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:53.280
 and then with that, along with again, our joy, our appreciation, our courage and commitment

00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:03.560
 and big, vast bodhicitta aspirations with confidence in the purity state of reality,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:12.080
 we'll continue with our nundra practice itself. Thank you.
