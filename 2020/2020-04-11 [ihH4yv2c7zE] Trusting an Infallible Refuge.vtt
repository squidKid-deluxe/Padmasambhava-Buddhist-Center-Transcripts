00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.910
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating and coming here, and we're together and practicing

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.700
, thinking of all living beings, and then practicing is very wonderful, and also reflecting on the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.000
 teachings, and all this is according to the teachings of the Great Teacher, Buddha Shabir. Thank

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 you very much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating and for participating and for participating in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:59.000
 this wonderful presentation. Thank you very much.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.140
 Before we begin the teaching, we always correct our motivation, the good motivation of the positive

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.510
, good motivation, beautiful motivation. That again is, we have many motivations, so among that, we

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.000
're going to raise up the good motivation,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.020
 which is joy and appreciation, and bodhicitta, and purity, understanding, or realization of the Vaj

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.810
rayana teachings. Those are foundations of the practices, those are the central columns of the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.000
 practices.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.430
 When we achieve that, exactly what we're thinking, when we got that, when we are known as

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.960
 enlightenment, Buddha hoped. So it is, everything, whole practice of the Buddha teaching is best

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.000
 upon this good motivation. That is what we are really revering by the teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 So, for that reason, we should not forget or ignore the basic essentials, goodness, and so reactiv

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.000
ate it. With this, then we'll go on the teaching.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.940
 In the teaching, as we're going slowly, any little details and reminding to each of us of this,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.000
 what gracious, great Master, His Holist taught.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:03:02.270
 So we really, His Holist, Ikyabjie Dunyum, what we taught. He taught, so we're following that. Then

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.380
 and here, today we are in the fifth line of this same, and we discussed all those resolvented from

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.490
 the oneself, from the ocean of samsaric sufferings, those are all we discussed, that and of course

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.000
 you all know, normally actually.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.320
 And today we are in this next line, the trusty that the Three Jewels are the intelligible source of

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.000
 representatives.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So we go on this. We're going to explore the meaning of this line.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 And this is the teachings on the Three Jewels, and as well as how we can connect the Three Jewels.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 Those are all the teachings, these teachings. So this is, and so now what Harvard said, Three Jew

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.000
els is what it is.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Three Jewels is the intelligible source of refuge.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 That is, to make that an intelligible source of refuge, how we should, we should trust, trust in

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.000
 confidence.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 So there is highlighted three points of this line.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Three Jewels, Three Jewels is the ultimate source of object of refuge.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.700
 And then how we should explore, how we should make that as happen with our trust, with our

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.000
 confidence.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.050
 That is what really this teaching is. So this is also another one, this is the teachings on the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.000
 refuge.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Refuge is the foundation of the entire Buddha teaching or the practices.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Refuge is also one way and one way Buddha gives the teaching.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And you worry, all the teachings what we're talking about, over 45 years, Buddha gives teachings.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Those all teaching can be summarized into three categories as we all know.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidhamma.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.560
 The essence or the meaning of those three teachings, principle teachings, is teachings on the moral

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.000
ities,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 teachings on the concentration, teachings on the resistance.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 That is what is. What is the reach of enlightenment? What is the discover of our beautiful nature?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 The Buddha nature, we need these three principles, teachings.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 We need morality, we need concentration, we need resistance.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Why is this? Because we need morality or ethics.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:02.750
 Our present ethics is very irregularity, very wild and not beneficial and also not practical, not

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.000
 simple.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 So therefore we have to have beautiful ethics.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 This ethic is also lined up with our nature, nature of the mind. It's lined up with our joy,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 respect, appreciation, contentment and then loving kindness.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 This is lined up that. So therefore this ethic is very so, morality is so important.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Rafuddhi is also, in other words, it is the foundation of the moralities.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.420
 Rafuddhi. When we take Rafuddhi in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, what it will bring us, it will

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.000
 bring calm.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Calm it to the mind. Bring calm and peace to the mind.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 We need to bring the calm and peace to the mind.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 What it does, immediately it will reflect to our verbal communication, verbal trust.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 It also will bring more gentle, more polite, more soft, more respectful speech or communication.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And that will also reflect the same thing to the physical.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Our activity of the physical will look more calm, more peaceful, more gentle.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So therefore this morality is so important.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 What in the teaching said, morality is the foundation.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:58.340
 Foundation has like everything and best all our realization of the enlightenment and the

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.000
 development of enlightenment.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.260
 Growth of enlightenment is the best of the morality. Morality is like ground. Morality is like

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.000
 earth.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Earth. And earth is the best of everyone.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 One. Those who are in the teaching always said, of course it is true.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Whether it will move or whether it will not move, earth is the best of everything.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And movable and amovable. So best is earth.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Similarly, its morality is grown of every realization and fulfillment and spiritual growth.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 And therefore, refuge is the central column of the morality.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And for that reason, in the teaching said, with all the refuge you will not have vows.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 So that means with all the refuge we will not have the Parthi Moksha vows,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 we will not have the Bodhisattva vows, and we will not have the vows of the Vedayan vows.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 And that also means with all the refuge we will not have the empowerment, transmissions, all this.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Therefore, this is really the foundation.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Foundation, at the same time, refuge is the first step towards enlightenment.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Now, how long have we been in samsara? According to the gracious teacher,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 the Bodhisattva's teaching, we have been in samsara for so long.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 There are even no numbers. Number less.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 But when we take refuge, we are determined to change the direction of our samsara situation.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 We are not going to go continually as a rollercoaster or rolling the boulder from the hill going

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 continually moving.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.510
 No, we like to put the stop. We are going to set the direction to our own destination of the future

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.000
.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 From now on, refuge is the beginning of that direction.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Beginning of putting brakes to our own, what's called, brakes to the car.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That's really what refuge is. And as I said, refuge is also without, we are stepping to the border

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 of the Nirvana.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Refuge is where we are entering the path.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 As the gracious teacher of Bodhisattva said, part truth.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 We now really begin the journey to the part truth.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 It's the beginning of the part truth.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And this is what we begin.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 This journey, this part truth, is not difficult, or hard chair, or changing some of our lifestyles.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.490
 It's the only we setting up with love, kindness, compassion, or concentration, and moving forward

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.000
 with mindfulness.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.240
 It is beautiful. It is special because it benefits to us, and as well as our one's own self, as

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.000
 well as others, such as our friends, payment members, all that.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 So that is what really refuge is. It's so important.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.470
 Refuge is not just we take refuge one time and then kind of forget. We will say, continue the

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.000
 refuge until we get enlightenment, until we become the border.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:27.640
 Refuge is our walking steps, or the vehicle that really move, continue. We move that, continue, and

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.000
 carry that, and always keep that.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.390
 And how are we going to keep that? With the courage, commitment, confidence, as is on the Dunyul

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.000
 Mutti, or Japje Dunyul Mutti pointed out there, trust it.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 With trust, we move that.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So this is the general kind of explanation, overview of this refuge and three jewels.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Now I talk really about the three jewels. Three jewels, in Sanskrit word, three retinas, three ret

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.000
inas.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 And it is translated in Tibet by each of those great emanated translators in the 8th century.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 "Kon-cho-some." "Kon-cho-some" means, what it means, is simply translated three jewels.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 But "Kon-cho-some" is more than three jewels.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.860
 What in it a very word "Kon" means, the rare, R-A-R-E, rare. And "cho" means supreme. It's not

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.000
 supreme, so this is not just the jewels.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:53.260
 It's a supreme, rare jewel. Rare jewel, and just an example, only example, these jewels won't carry

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.000
 all the qualities of the three jewels.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Jewels, they don't matter, but they just use examples. It's more than that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:12.120
 Three jewels is, three jewels is loving kindness. Three jewels is compassion. Three jewels is

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.000
 worship.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Three jewels is respecting the apprehensions to all the living beings without any disconnections.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 And that three jewels is love and kindness and compassion forever for all the sentient beings.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.430
 It's not limited by the times and the spaces. And getting all the wishes, wishes of joy,

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:46.000
 appreciation, peace, happiness, confidence, support, protection.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 That's what really three jewels is when you are connected to these three jewels.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:05.610
 Satisfaction, contentment, and it's performed for four weeks. Therefore, this is called rare and

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.000
 supreme, the jewel.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And how many days? There's three. And what those of you all know, but I'm going to list again.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And the Chiang Kai names of the three jewels is considering very sacred works.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 So, in what I was teaching said, of course, you all know, I take refuge in the Buddha.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 So, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha are the three rare, supreme ones, all three jewels.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So, that is really the old meaning of the three jewels.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 And now, I talk really, again, old Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, each of those. A little bit over there.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 What is really meaning is the Buddhas. And how many years is the Buddhas, generally?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Generally, speaking about the Buddhas, they call it a great kind, great completionist teacher,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Buddha said.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:24.690
 There are so many Buddhas. Buddhas in east directions, Buddhas in south directions, Buddhas in the

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.000
 west directions,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Buddhas in the north directions, Buddhas above us, Buddhas below the earth, lower directions.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:53.120
 Those are known as six directions in Buddhism, six cardinal directions in the teaching set, not

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.000
 just only four cardinal directions.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.090
 There are so many Buddhas. There are also in the accord of Buddha's teaching, there are so many

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.000
 universes in every direction.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 In other words, maybe I use "world". There are so many worlds in every direction.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 This is not isolated, single, lonely universe where we live. There are so many.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Numberless, also even in the teaching set, numberless, numberless universe in every direction.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And there are those different directions. There are so many enlightened.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So those all are known as the Buddhas. But particularly this time of the Buddha,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.760
 or this era of the Buddha in our world, or our universe, whatever we call, in this world is known

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.000
 as renowned Buddha,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni, which is the founder of the Buddhism.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 This is the first great Master of this time.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.830
 And while I'm saying this time, there is also before that, Buddha Shakyamuni, there are many Budd

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.000
has that came in this very world.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And there will be also many Buddhas that are going to come in the future.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 This Buddha, which I'm talking about the Buddha Shakyamuni, welcomes so many.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 In fact, we all know there is one Golden Buddha.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 He is planning to come or scheduled to come in this world among them.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.570
 Three have gone long time ago. The fourth came and his teachings remain, such as the Buddha Shakyam

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.000
uni.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 So that means, how many Shakyamuni? 996, 996, 996 Shakyamuni.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 So this is the fourth Buddha.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Three Buddhas went before, Buddha Shakyamuni. This is the fourth Buddha, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Now, that is generally about the Buddhas.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 But what Buddha means, what a Buddha?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 If I say simply, Buddhas are free from all the nakedities and obscurations.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 In obscurations, what that means?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Dualities, grasping, clingings, negative emotions, as we were talking the other day,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 such as the cause of suffering, truth, those negative emotions, ignorance, attachment, anger,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 jealous, erodized, self-important, sub-centered mind, all those all gone, all purified, all gone.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So what is now Buddha is?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 The fool of love, fool of compassion, fool of wisdom.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 There is nothing higher, deeper, you can grow, grow love and compassion and wisdom.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 That is the Buddha what they gain, Buddha gain that.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 I mean, there is nothing higher to go.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 The realization level, there is nothing higher to go.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 That means realization, I'm talking about loving kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 The ultimate state they achieve or they attain.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 In obscuration and negativity level, everything is removed, purified.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Even the habit of hurting or the strain, the smell of the activities is gone.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 The smell of the fragrance or whatever is gone completely.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:43.600
 That the beauty, that embodiment, loving kindness, compassion, wisdom, that is really known as

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.000
 Buddhism.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 So that is really Buddhism.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 So this is not just one person. All the Buddhas are similar, same, realization states.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Now when they reach that status, what is, then what they do do, what they will do?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 According to the teaching, then they continually benefit from all the living beings,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 from all the living beings until they reach enlightenment.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 What that also means, according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 that every living being inherited, same nature or same potential or same college,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 then Buddha themselves, there is no difference.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 That means this Buddha is once upon a time as regular ordinary beings, ordinary individuals.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 As many of ours, like that.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 But because of their courage, commitment, determination,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 and preserving the loving kind in the compassion and purifying all the negative emotions,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 then they become the Buddha.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 So every living being has the same opportunities, same potentials,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 same status, everyone can reach that same state.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 If they walk for that enlightenment.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 So once you reach enlightenment of Buddhahood,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 these Buddhas are beginning to help all the sentient beings,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 according their capabilities, according their readiness,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 gently, peacefully, very respectfully, very cooperative level, they are helping.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Helping and supporting, assuring everyone to the part, to the enlightenment

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 or part to the Nirvana.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 That is the one that really this all Buddhas are doing.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 So to explain of these Buddhas, how in the teaching state,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 and in three different ways that I am going to explain a little bit about the Buddhas.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 And fourth is their poems.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Second is their verses.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Third is their activities.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 So these three we go through, explore the glance of the college of these great beings.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 And the fourth is their bodies.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Bodies are known as in Sanskrit word, Kaya.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Kaya is Sanskrit word, but also Kaya is best of them, best, B-A-S-E, I think best.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 What means best?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Because wisdom and activity Buddhas are best on the Kaya anyway.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 So therefore, it is known as best.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 And how in the debate it is, they were good.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Then Yishi, and they were clean.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 This is called three word.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 It's best.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 It's best.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 So what kind of, what means body?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 It's Sanskrit Kaya.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 And how many Kayas?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Generally summarize the Kayas.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 The four Kayas, that is sometimes also mentioned in five Kayas.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 But four Kayas.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 And those are popular, that we all know.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Such as Dharma Kaya Buddha, Sambo Kaya,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Nama Kaya, and Soba Kaya.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Those are four Kayas.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 So that is really the Kaya.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And Kaya, I translated Kaya as Bodhi,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 or it can be poems too, F-O-R-N.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 So those are Dharma Kaya, Sambo Kaya,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 and Nama Kaya, and then the Soba Kaya.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Or sometimes also as Sasa of the major Dharma Kayas.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Whether Dharma Kaya, Soba Kaya, this is similar.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And in the debate, it is translated by each and tiny,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 those great emanated translators in the 8th century.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Chuko, Lungko, Truko, and Mohon Yekos.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Those are the four Kayas.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 These four Kayas are, even though they are four Kayas,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 but they are the same nature.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Same nature. What that means?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Their loving kindness, compassion, wisdom,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 that embodiment, this they are.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Whether it is Soba Kaya, whether it is Dharma Kaya,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 and whether it is Sambo Kaya, and whether that is Nama Kaya.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Those are all known as good acts, all the four Kayas.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And now I'm going to stop here for today, and then we will continue.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Thank you very much everyone,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 and that's my brief reminding of the word His Holiness.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 This is a teaching story, so trying to explore His Holiness,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Jyapji, the ultimate story,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 and then we continue the course continually doing this,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 and practicing, and dedicating this merit for all the living beings,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 particularly this time.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 It's just so kind of tense and so terrible situation is happening

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 around the world and the globe.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 And it's just really, that's what we can do.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Igniting our good heart and good motivation,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 as told by the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 and Gurbel Massama, and to do that contribution

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 toward this difficult time,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 is I think something really we can do,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 and please we will think that even during the meditating

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 and then healing practices, we all are going to do this.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And just really thinking, to purify this suffering,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 the difficulty, troubles, challenges.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And this is just a reminder to us.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 There is samsara, so many difficulties, troubles,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 just goes on and on.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 For that reason, what great teacher Buddha Shakyamuni

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 and all those great massa have told,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 told, may all living beings have the happiness and the cause of happiness.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 May all living beings free from suffering and the cause of sufferings.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 May all living beings have never, may all living beings

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 always have the supreme happiness,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 which is never separated from suffering.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 May they always remain great economically.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 The close ones, and as well as to the distant ones, economically.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 I mean, that's really so powerful, so true to the heart.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And also so down to the earth, simple, yet powerful.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Prayers, we should pray these things to you,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 along with our healing practices, thinking of those who are only in the evening.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And in dedicating this, our merit is to all the living beings who are sick,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 who are, like process, sick, who pass away,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 or who is having difficulty, troubles, whatever, experiences, really do this.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That is not a thing, activity of the bodhisattvas.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 When we follow the footsteps of the kines, our lokrihora,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 manjushiri, Vaidyapani, and Buddhahajaktamani,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Gaurabhama sambhava, Tara, and all the great enlightened beings,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 we really follow that.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 It is great to everyone, so good.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 And okay, just as I'm talking to you all,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 and of course you all know these things,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 we all know kind of these things,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 this really activated is so wonderful.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 And thank you again, thank you very much for the body spinning,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 and now we do a short meditation.
