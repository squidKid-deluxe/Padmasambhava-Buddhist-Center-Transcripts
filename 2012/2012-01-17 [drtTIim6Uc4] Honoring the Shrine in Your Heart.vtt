00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 This trusset of the shrine is generally the same. Basically, there are not many differences.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.400
 So you can set up the shrine, such as like this. I mean, this trusset of the shrine.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.870
 The shrine, and F, it suits with your situation, or it allows by the circumstances, that trusset of

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.000
 the shrine, when you practice it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Then F, it not suits with your circumstances, such as family members, and so forth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.030
 But then you don't have to struggle with that to set up the shrine. And then we have to set the

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.000
 shrine in the heart.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 It's because this shrine is symbolic, but the real shrine is in our heart. That is what.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 And that shrine is what is that shrine. That is your love, your devotion to the Buddha, Dharma, San

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.000
gha.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.990
 The unparalleled devotion and the confidence and the trust to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.000
 the ultimate real shrine.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 With that shrine, then we have the opportunity to set up the shrine. This is good because it is

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 symbolic.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 It will reflect that beauty of your nature, beauty of connection is that. It will remind you that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.760
 Also to set up the shrine, it will also need some duty effort to set up this shrine, if you have

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.000
 the opportunity.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.520
 To set up the shrine nice and beautiful, you need joyful effort. Joyful effort is what you all know

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.000
. It will stop the laziness.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 It will say, it will say, be quite laziness. You laziness have been so long with me. And now I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.000
 recognize your value and your consequence.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.030
 So I'm not going to listen to you, to you lazy. Lazy, that isn't what the lady means. So it will

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 inspire.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.270
 It's a symbol of your joyful effort, courage and commitment, that how you really do that. Even

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.000
 though it looks in one way small, but it represents something special.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 It's a joyful effort. And then you already have that absolute shrine in your heart. Heart then is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 reflected. It's a beautiful mirror image.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.050
 So set up the shrine is very beautiful and special. Every circumstance has a set. Set that of a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.000
 loss or something.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.080
 That means when you set up the shrine, you're not going to feel upset and you're not going to make

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.000
 upset others because you know the Buddha teaching is to make happy, peaceful to everyone.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.640
 Not just overpowering, crushing the others or disrespectful. We have to keep everyone happy and joy

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.000
 and peace.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.330
 And the same time we didn't lost our principle. That is the one. We shouldn't have lost our

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.000
 principle. Keep in the heart.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 In practice. Practice means actually in the heart. That is we have to bloom open from there.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.150
 So therefore nobody will know your love and joy and practice and to do the Buddha dharmasanga by

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 others, it won't even bother too much to others.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.720
 We behave nicely, respectful, joy. Everybody will love that. So then it is not really you making

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.000
 joy and peace, creating the nice things around. It's nice. It's good.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 So therefore set up the shrine. Have you had the opportunity? If not, have you set up the shrines,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.110
 particularly with these practices, then you should have the pucho of the channels or tanga of the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.000
 channels.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 All the statues, all of those, it's good because that which you are practicing, but at the same

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.000
 time represent great compassion.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.820
 So it is symbolize your beautiful compassion. And therefore that is the pucho of all the tangas on

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.000
 the shrine.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.270
 And then when you put up the shrine, those always in the teaching said, when you set up the shrine,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.000
 you have to put beautiful display, beautiful, nice, as much as you can.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.210
 Can it's nice, soothing, calming. For example, somebody sees that or look to that. We need to see

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.000
 this. It's how nice, how beautiful it is. It's appealing.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.030
 It's soothing, calming. That is what we should do. It's not just to put everything on the shrine.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.000
 Everything is this. It's not just to become your small table of the collection.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.200
 A legend that peace and peace and peace, all that put up on the shrine, shrine and that. And then

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.000
 maybe it's something you're going to think, I'm going to go to the art cells.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.100
 Something that really looks nice. Always you feel happy, how beautiful. When I sit down in front of

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.000
 it, I feel calm, peace and joy, relaxed.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Something like that. That's something to connect you to the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.350
 And nicely, even if you have so many things, you don't have to put everything you can. It's

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.920
 something nice and beautiful, soothing, clean, not too crowded and young as like New York City,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.000
 tough and lighter or in a traffic jam.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.610
 Not just always like in India, in the street. So many crowded, but you don't need that. You have to

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.000
 calm, clean, nice. That's what we need.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.490
 In front of that, then always in the teaching said, then you have the opportunity again, if you

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:25.060
 have those seven bowls as great symbols, if not, then always in the teaching said, light, incense

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.000
 and flowers.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.840
 Those are three, three, light, incense and flowers. And then of course, when you put light, you

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.620
 have to again, think carefully about this. So many fire those goals and as well as also incense too

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.000
.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.030
 So you have to be more kind of practical and also nice. So it's not just become also nice, nice

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.000
 things.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So beautiful, this really nice soothing. Put that on the show. And so that is generally about the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 show.
