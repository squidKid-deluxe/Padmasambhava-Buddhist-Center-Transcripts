00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.040
 Merely recognizing the nature of the mind or the river will not bring the full liberation, full

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.400
 bloom.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:23.000
 Understanding is a used realization. Generally, there is practice lineage as a dream.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 Understanding, realization, and stabilizing, these three are important. At the beginning of time,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
 we understand.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.650
 I think that's good. Good understanding. At the beginning of time, we understand. How we understand

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.000
, intellectually understand.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 This is not. Actually, we also understand as two understandings.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Undersing, intellectually understanding of realization levels.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But at the beginning of the time, we understood intellectually.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 When you receive the teaching, or when you start teaching, then you see, "Oh, that makes sense.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 That understands. Oh, I understand how I want to talk."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 So that is really understanding, intellectually. You investigate it, analyze it, and you receive

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 the teaching,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 and you also put yourself some degree of the analytic thought and some kind of little bit more

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 tangible understanding.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 That is understanding. Now that understanding, then you're going to put that into practices.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Practice is that, as I already said, with joy and with joy for effort.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 But practice. Practice. Oh, exactly. Follow the instructions. Follow us.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Then our embrace. Then go the glimpse of realizations.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 Grams and practice. Even you got the glimpse of realizations, still the habit pattern won't go

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 completely.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It will soften, it is going away, but it's not really going to go away.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Then, finally, it's full-blown realizations.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 That is according to the Buddha's teaching. For example, I'm sure you heard that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Path-paths. Accumulation-path, application-path, seeing-path, meditation-path.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 That's among five-path, four-path. What is the teaching said?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 In accumulation-path, practitioner will understand.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 In that, in the application-path, they're getting some realizations.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Seeing-path, they got full-blown realizations.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 In meditation-path, they're stabilizing. Stabilizing that realization.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So this is a practical layout. Again, the greatest teacher, Buddha Chakra Muniz.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And these average people found those certain individuals, highly capable,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 instantly they got realizations, instantly.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 According to teaching, and very few of the doctor, master, known as Panki Muhanggung.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Panki Muhanggung. And he was so old. Old already at that time.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I'm sure many of you heard that story. I've met him, and Katie Parnishan, I've met him.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 I'm sure many of the other great master makers have heard that.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Panki Muhanggung was so old and at the same time, one old man.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 He's come from Eastern Tibet. He heard the repetition of the great zokimas, the dero-chan of Tibet.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Dero-chan of Tibet. He heard this human tongue.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And he was suffering because he's so old, he has every sense of everything also played.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 At the same time, his relatives and family members are also not so nice to him.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.910
 They have all those warm troubles, covers. But he heard that time, the repetition and good things

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.000
 about Dero-chan.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 He always thought, "When I can meet him, if I'm young, I have to go, I like to meet him,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 but I'm old and can't travel, and to see him when I can meet him."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 But finally, Dero-chan is in Eastern Tibet. In time, he's returning back to Central Tibet.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 On the path he waited, he heard Dero-chan has come. He waited on the road.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.360
 He asked the family member to support and try to where Dero-chan has traveled, but that path, he

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.000
 waited.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And the moment is, she's so excited and happy.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 "Please, great teacher, give me teaching. I'm old, I'm fever, I won't know how long I will stay,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 but I like to receive that great teaching I heard you give me. Will you give me teaching?"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And Dero-chan saw his perfectly high cup of blood practice, practice.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And Dero-chan again, Dero-chan teaches, Dero-chan teaches, Dero-chan teaches.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And he was so excited, so happy. The moment he received, in the teaching he said that,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 in history, he had so long time, Dero-chan, he helped by receiving his teaching.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And Dero-chan also gave him that meditation support, because his posture, he cannot be possible.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And there is strength, that push of his chains, it was called, Dero-chan.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And he also gave instructions to use the meditation, but that he cannot stay in the posture.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.400
 So he used those techniques, he meditated, he reached, I said that there was the right body, very

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.000
 soon.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 He was one of the first of the great masters of the Dzokhi, Dzokhi disciple, but from Dero-chan.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 One of the leading Dzokhi lineage masters, lineage models.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 And through his, from him, and then continued succession of the seven generations,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.140
 that his, his disciple, their disciple, one after the other, seven generations, they got rainbow

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.000
 boarders.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.140
 So where, they said, Pang of Hong Kong, who is considered one of the great, highly capable

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.000
 practices,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 highly capable individuals. So certain individuals can reach enlightenment, very good.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 While from master, while from qualified teacher, qualified student,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.990
 and qualified teacher, all that became, and right home time, that's it. You got it. You get it

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.000
 right.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 But every ripple takes time. When it takes time, what needs?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.350
 As I said, joyful effort and joy. And continue keeping the instructions in the heart and mind, and

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.000
 follow.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.880
 Surely, we will reach this connection, as all enlightenment, all those great masters, one after

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.000
 another.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 One after another. It's not just a story of 800 years ago, or 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It is continuous evidence of all those great practices.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Now we call the masters, but they're not born with masters.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 They're born as dedicated, dedicated practitioners, dedicated loyalty practitioners.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Practicing, keeping close heart, and read the life story of the great master, Maharaj.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 He was a highly capable individual. Yet, how much he put effort in a life.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 In a life, this is not just a malaria, all these three, Lomchimba, too.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.270
 Lomchimba is highly enlightened statement, but yet, how long he put also effort, joyful effort, med

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.000
itative practices.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Lomchimba is one of the highest scholars, intellectual masters in the Buddhist history.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.790
 Truth, or maybe every aspect of it, or maybe every country, he can be one of the greatest scholars

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.000
 in the world.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 But yet, when he has received the teaching, intellectually, he knows everything.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 He started, he become known as omniscient, intellectually, but to receive the instructions,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 he met, contacted him with a qualified teacher, and received the teachings.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Teaching, he observed it hard, and practiced it.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Lomchimba's teaching said, in his story, Lomchimba was external material.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 He was very poor, really poor, mainly he was able to sustain his ritual food.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Because his family is also poor, many times in Italy, those practices were supported by the family.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Family, Lomchimba was really quite poor, poor.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 But yet, his courage and commitment, he continually stayed with Lomchimba for six years,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 deceiving all the teachings, with his tokens, the lineage blessings.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And more than time, he would think, oh, he is so a scholar, so knows everything,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 why he had to stay that long with that great masters.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 But yet, he stayed.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And then he deserved all the teachings.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Then he put that into practices.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 But at this time, he was also poor, material, poor.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And knowledge, realization, they were rich, very rich, multimillion of billionaires, definitely.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 But yet, material is poor.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And what he did, Lomchimba has only one bag.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 One bag, then a big bag of the yap hair, yap hair, big bag made of yap hair.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 This was his cloth, this was his blanket, this was his cushion.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 He stayed in high altitude in a winter time, winter, in summer, whatever.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 He stayed with that bag.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 And practicing, meditating.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Then Lomchimba become the great Lomchimba.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Lomchimba become known as second Garab Dorji, homonitansi, Garab Dorji of Tibet.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Truly, one of the great Dzogchi masters, great scholars, great realization beings.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And yet, yet, full of love and compassion, known to the earth.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 That is how great master Lomchimba is.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Even his highly capable and breathtakingness, or highly capable beings, yet he counter that.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 That's why. Read other life stories too, Naropa.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Naropa, as of course you all heard his name, I'm sure, many of you know, I know.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Naropa is one of the great master's and scholars in his times,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 in the Bhakarma Chilla Monastu University in India.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 He said, he is the scholar of the north, north, very famous scholar.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 But one time, he heard from the dakkino, the vegan.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 You are expert on the world, W-O-R-D, world.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 You are expert on the worlds, but you are not expert on the meanings.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And let you know the meaning of the world, contract with Master Thilopa.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Master Thilopa.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 And then, at that time, he was already thinking to pursue and meditate.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 So with that kind of encourage him, he contract with Thilobas.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And the Thiloba contract, when he contract, and how many?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 There is known as 12 big ascetic practices and 24 minor ascetic practices.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 That Thilobas did not give immediate teaching, even word of teaching.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 In a way, he is making harsh.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 More than time, maybe we can tell, oh, he is abusing.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Abusing, taking advantage of all that.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But narrow, but never lingering of his courage and commitment, his devotion, his determinations.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 He contract long time.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Final teaching.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Thilobas did not give any particular teachings, and in the teachings,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 the final day, he removed his sandal wool, or sandal, the shoe, sandal, right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Sandal.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 And he, right hand, left hand, he wear all the Naropasi discolored color,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 and the left hand, the sandal was slippery, and banged to his face.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 And he felt unconsciousness.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Unconsciousness.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 He felt it all.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 When he woke up that unconsciousness, the brilliant realization of the true,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 exactly what he is looking for.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 It's completely done in the heart, fully. Fully done, fully shined in the heart.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 And what Naropa says, or what the Naropa says, I did not give any word to you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Any word.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Because the Naropa is an expert on words.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Not to give any word.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 So they didn't show anything to you.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 But he got full realization, burned in his heart.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 What the great Master Padra Rinpoche said that, he said,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 all during that time, Naropa is purified his obscurations.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 This great Master Thilobas, skillfully,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 because it looks like all those kinds of torturing there, all the trouble.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 But he is purified all his obscurations, and accumulating madness,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 serving to the teachers.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Knowing exactly what teachers has to do, has to do.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And then he got a realization.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 What's going on?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 My time is stopped.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 (Laughter)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 11.55.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 11.55. Okay, good timing, I remind you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 (Laughter)

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And so that's what it really is.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 For that reason, for every individual, we continually really need,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 we need joyful effort, courage and commitment,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 with loyalty and practicing, with them.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And so then, all that.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 In order to do that, he said, all the activities of the three doors,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 all through an activity of the mundane activity completely, can't relate.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Just stand yourself, and then spend your time to the practices.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Practices.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Practices, and those are said here, nine different things.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Three doors, or three, three here.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 And it's a Tibet word, three door, go some, go some in three doors.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Three doors is a metaphor for the body, speech, and mind,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 because these three are the passage of the positive and the negative,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 but therefore used in, again, of course, with a teaching,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 teaching is called go some.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 So that the activity of the body is big, gross activity of body,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 middle activity of the body, and it's very small, minor activity of the body,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and it's pretty same with those are nine.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So how to put that inside, and put in time to practices.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 And when you put practices, then again here, more,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 and the teachings and the struggles of where we practice,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 and everything, what we do, is everything is,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 by the duality, is deluded.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And we follow with the delusions one after another,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 that we're never going to find undiluted nature.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 So therefore, should not have any kind of grasp,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 any kind of grasp, we cling in holding, but relax,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 and liberate every activity of the six senses.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Activity, six senses I already mentioned earlier,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 and you all know mostly, you know, six senses are the senses of the eye,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 and the eye, and the conscious,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 and the nose, and the tongue, and the body, and the mind,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 those are the six senses.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 So, then, kind of release that.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 If you do that, keep that, then,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 then your result, the final zouki result is coming,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 coming, and that is known as namjil.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Lord, it is how wonderful, how delightful,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 and now that is the result zouki.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Really, I will explain here.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 The result zouki, by then, we will get the true,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 satisfactory goal, goal right now, for now, and for future.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 When you got that realization, that true goal,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 and achievement of that realization,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 then the whole, the future, those struggling situation,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 or passages, such as Vardhava, and lottery, Lord Ramsa,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 or even Samsara, is just only, only a million names.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 There's nothing to be worried.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 You reach to the like, unexhorted, free from all,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 the conceptual status, and the permanent, great, joyful,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 and ordinary nature, the meaning of your own kunduzang.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Then you reach their status.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So, in a way, when you reach there, that moment,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 you are saying goodbye to the Samsara.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Goodbye, Samsara.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So, that is really a more resolved arm of the zouki,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 a result of the zouki.
