NOTE     "synopsis": "On August 26, 2016 at Padma Samye Ling in new York, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche and the PSL Sangha warmly welcomed His Eminence Terton Namkha Drimed Rinpoche to bestow a Guru Rinpoche empowerment and teaching according to His Eminence's own mind terma.\n\nEnjoy this celebratory video of His Eminence ascending the staircase in front of the main temple at PSL, lined with over 120 joyous practitioners eager to meet His Eminence and receive His blessings and teachings.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\n\"HE Namkha Drimed Rinpoche is the supreme head of the Ripa lineage of Nyingma Vajrayana Buddhism and is a living terton. The Ripa lineage has its historical roots in Glorious Master Ripa Pema Deje Rolpa, the leader of both the family and Dharma lineages of Rigon Tashi Choeling Monastery.\n\nFrom the age of 8, Namkha Drimed Rinpoche has had numerous pure visions of Guru Rinpoche, who conferred on him empowerments and spiritual advice beyond measure. Due to the blessings he received on these occasions, His Eminence was granted personal transmissions of a veritable ocean of profound hidden treasures of enlightened intent. In addition, he has been graced with visions of the Eight Manifestations of Guru Rinpoche, Hayagriva, Dorje Drolo, Mahottara Heruka, Avalokiteshvara, the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal, the divine consort Mandarava, and others from among the entire vast array of peaceful and wrathful dieties of the Three Roots (Guru, Yidam, Dakini). In particular, he has had repeated visions of Lord Gesar -- the great Lion and Wish-Fulfilling Gem -- surrounded by hosts of his spiritually accomplished kinsmen, receiving their blessings. On the basis of this, he has codified the cycle entitled Rigsum Norbui Gongdzo (Treasury of the Enlightened Intent of the Gem of the Three Buddha Families), which is a very exalted and timely spiritual teaching.\n\nHis Eminence is a regent of the Lake-Born Lotus, Guru Padmasambhava, in the world. He is a Terton, revealer of hidden treasures, an emanation of one of Guru Rinpoche\u2019s close personal students. He was Arya Sale, consort to Guru Rinpoche\u2019s primary disciple Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nPreviously, in India, he was Sariputra, one of Buddha Shakyamuni\u2019s top two disciples. Also he was Kukuraja who received a personal transmission of the tantric teachings concerning the supreme secrets; and as the Master Mahahumkara, he accomplished Samyak, the diety of enlightened mind.\n\nIn Tibet, the Land of Snows, his lineage of rebirths includes Namkhai Nyingpo, the monk of the Nub clan; the master of awareness Gyalwa Chokyang; and Rechung Dorje Drakpa (Rechungpa), the heart son of the venerable Milarepa who established the Kagyu monastic lineage. In the Kingdom of Lingtri Karmo in eastern Tibet, he was reborn as Dongbumpai Gyatsa Zhalkar, the Chief Lord amongst the multitude of the warrior king Lord Gesar\u2019s spiritually accomplished kinsmen. He was Gesar\u2019s brother. He was also Gyalwa Gotsangpa, an accomplished master of the Drukpa Kagyu school.\n\nIn particular, Namkha Drimed Rinpoche was reborn as the omniscient Longchenpa, often referred to as \u2018The King of the Dharma\u2019, the famous Great Perfection master whose writings are studied today by Dzog Chen practitioners. As Longchenpa, he was the great helmsman of the teachings of the supreme spiritual approach of utter lucidity. Longchenpa is commonly recognized as the greatest thinker and most brilliant mind ever to arise within the Nyingma School of Buddhism.\n\nAmong the 100 or more great tertons who were emanations of Guru Rinpoche\u2019s personal students, His Eminence was Tangtong Gyalpo. Among the 13 great tertons who revealed hidden treasure teachings of the Vajrayana approach, His Eminence was Mingyur Dorje Drakpo Nudentsal; also the fourth sublime Taksham incarnation Padma Gyepai Dorje; as well as the incarnation Lord Padma Deje Rolpa of Ripa. In later times he was Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, a powerful lord among accomplished masters, and the great and exalted Padma Lingpa, who was a magical emanation of the bodhisattva of supreme compassion. The great master of Orgyen, Guru Rinpoche, who knows the Three Times, clearly attested in his vajra prophecies to the pure rebirths that His Eminence would take.\n\nIn these times of spiritual degeneration, Namkha Rinpoche has taken rebirth as an expression of the innately compassionate and timeless awareness of, at one and the same time, Guru Dorje Drolo Tsal, Arya Sale, Gyalse Lhaje, and most especially the great lion Lord Gesar, Norbu Dradul Tsal.\"\n\nCopied from: http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Namkha_Drimed_Rinpoche\n\nFor more information about His Eminence Namkha Drimed Rinpoche, please visit His website: www.ripaladrang.org",
