00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 Very warm greetings, friends. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you. We're here again, which is always

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.400
 just a bright celebration, honestly. To come together, to reflect on the Dharma, on the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.440
 nature, on goodness, on our own goodness, on the goodness of others is such a special opportunity,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.640
 and we keep choosing to connect to that, to our goodness and others' goodness. And this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.480
 is just such a vibrant, beautiful, loving, wonderful thing we can do with our time, with

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.080
 our each other. And so thanks for doing that. Thanks for making the time and showing up

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.960
 and kind of being interested and like, you know, activating this goodness, this brightness

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.400
 that we all have. And so as we always begin these reflections, our study and practice

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.880
 with the Dharma, we kind of connect to this brightness that we share. And like Rinpoche's,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.080
 because they always say that begins with joint appreciation, or renunciation mind, is gratitude,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.360
 like a genuine gratitude for the, all the amazing things we have going for us. And so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 we don't have to keep it too far out. We can just keep it really close. You know, the body

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.400
 I have that's working, you know, the food that I have in my stomach, the language I

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.680
 speak that I didn't have to create, the air that I breathe, that's not killing me when

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.760
 I breathe it. I mean, there's so many things, of course, the living thread of Dharma that's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.200
 still available, the teachings that have been preserved, the mom and dad and friends that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.080
 cared for us when we were little babies, that without them, we wouldn't be able to be here

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.260
 right now. There's just, we can kind of bring up this list if it helps in our mind, or also

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.200
 just kind of relax and feel what it feels like to just be here to like, sit, feet on

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 the ground, kind of have that just a little bit more of this shining appreciation instead

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 of emphasizing what's off, what's wrong, what's crooked, what's whatever uncomfortable kind

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.360
 of highlight instead, what's really lovely. And that's just how we're turning our mind

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.320
 to what is a lovely part of my experience now. And so that's the first part of poisoning

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.240
 our mind for it to shine out its own goodness, the loveliness of what's outside and what's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.200
 inside. And then secondly, to emphasize more what's good outside, this special quality

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.560
 we all have, this goodness in Buddhism, they call it Buddha nature, but there's this good

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.240
 heart. So to really remember that, I have a good heart, you have a good heart, we have

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.440
 really good heart, this beautiful, bright intelligence we have, and to kind of, while

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.720
 we have this intelligence, we also go through so many challenges and ups and downs, and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.520
 we really know this, the tension, the body tension, mind tension, all these tensions.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.360
 So none of us want that. We all want to be happy. So why are we doing this? Why do we

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.940
 study the Dharma? Why are we reflecting on it? Why are we trying to put it into practice

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.120
 and have our minds brighten, have our hearts open? So all beings can connect to their own

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.640
 goodness, their own brightness, their own loveliness. So this bodhicitta, heart-mind

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.720
 of enlightenment, really kind of activate that. May this be of direct and immediate

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.520
 benefit for every single being to just fully actualize their own wonderful, boundless nature

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.720
 of wisdom and compassion, the bodhicitta. And then thirdly, this pure perception or

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.240
 Vajra pride, this clear seeing, when the mind isn't kind of so fixated, so tense, so frustrated,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.760
 so kind of collapsed in on itself, that when it's not doing that, it's going to be relaxed,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:54.640
 open, buoyant, fresh, vivid, connected, embodied. It's very present. It's very engaged. It's

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 like sizzling with energy. And so there's a lot of ways to unpack this. But in general,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.920
 we can call this like a divine mandala filled with divine beings. This is like a very harmonious

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.040
 set of conditions, and we're a part of that, each of us. So pure body, pure speech, pure

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.920
 mind, deity, mantra, Dharmakaya, this kind of really bring up this courageous view that

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.640
 this goodness is everywhere, outside, inside, all around, in between. This is all goodness.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.440
 So kind of rest in that instead of feeling like there's some big problem to solve, some

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.480
 big fire to put out, something wrong to write. Instead of that, just relax. And I'm saying

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 this right to myself. Hey, Drakpa, just relax. This is good. Don't have to really change

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.760
 something. So with this joy, connect with others with a really genuine good heart, just

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:19.240
 relax. This is already so good. Let me just do that together for a moment. Thank you.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.760
 So we have a brief little window of time to kind of reflect on the Dharma. And there's

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.680
 so many angles and ways we can unpack natural systems, our nature, our mind, what's outside,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.200
 what's inside. So today I've kind of chosen a little theme. Like I do, it's helpful for

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.280
 me to kind of think of a little corner of the maze of reality and to kind of play in

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.920
 that space for a little while. So today's theme is holding one's feet to the fire by

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:56.240
 joyfully embracing voluntary simplicity, holding one's own feet to the fire, by joyfully embracing

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.680
 voluntary simplicity. So a lot lately I've been thinking about what is it to be a living

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.160
 breathing being in the middle of a web of living breathing things that come together

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:19.440
 in part to integrate and disintegrate. You know, just all the things of the gushy, messy,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.360
 uncontrolled, flexing, living nature of being a human in a world that we can't control.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.200
 And largely with a body that I can't control and a mind that I definitely seem to not be

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:41.040
 able to control. Jump, jump, jump. So I've been thinking about that a lot. And so holding

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.560
 one's own feet to the fire by joyfully embracing voluntary simplicity. So I decided on this

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.200
 topic and then I was thinking after I decided on this a couple days ago, right afterwards,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.400
 I saw a video and I just showed this to Lama Lai recently. And you might have seen it,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:09.560
 the first Matrix movie, 1999, 24 years ago. Okay, there's a scene in this first Matrix

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:18.680
 movie. And it's the first time when Morpheus introduces Neo to the construct. This is a

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.040
 giant boundless white space where all of a sudden Keanu Reeves Neo pops up and Lawrence

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:33.000
 Fishburne Morpheus pops up and they look like themselves. And it's this holding space where

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.400
 they could just put any program in there and all of a sudden the white area, the white

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:46.040
 world system with these two Neo and Morpheus can be populated by anything they want. Nature,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.480
 weapons, a city, a jump training program, anything. They're in the middle of a program.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.720
 But they seem real to themselves and to each other. And they can populate this giant blank

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:06.440
 white space with anything they want. Maybe you remember the scene. I'll link to it if

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:17.220
 you're watching this video. Look below. Okay, two days ago, this became reality. Mark Zuckerberg

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.800
 put out the first interview in the metaverse. And what does it look like? A giant boundless

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:31.600
 white space with Mark Zuckerberg standing in it and the interviewer, Lex Friedman, standing

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.560
 in it. And it's nearly indistinguishable from real life, from their bodies. They're talking,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:47.360
 moving, their lighting changes, the emotionality changes. So this scene from this Matrix movie

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:55.640
 1999 is now real. So we're two days into that. So you'll see, maybe if you're older and not

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.960
 interested in this, if you're younger and you have a phone and you have some money to

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:08.300
 get some headset goggles within the year, you'll know this space a lot more than today.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.960
 This is no longer science fiction. This is no longer a movie. So the question is, how

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.400
 am I going to populate that space? How are you going to populate that space? A giant

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:28.680
 boundless, frameless white space that doesn't follow the laws of physics? Where you can

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.400
 show up in any way you want? Where you can do anything you want? In any language you

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:47.160
 want? With whoever you want? So the topic is holding oneself to the fire, one's feet

00:09:47.160 --> 00:10:00.520
 to the fire. And another way of looking at this, how do I hold myself accountable? Responsibility.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:10.600
 We're entering a time where I can literally create the, I can populate my world that I

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:21.880
 experience with anything I want and it will seem real. So how do I hold myself accountable

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:36.040
 in that? This is a very interesting window that we're entering in. Because any living

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:44.680
 system that actually thrives over time, it has constraints. It has boundaries. It has

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:52.560
 membranes. It has things that can and cannot do. Living systems have to be in touch with

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.800
 each other. The water has to be in touch with the wind and the fire and the metal and the

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 earth and the beings have to be in touch with each other. And the food we eat goes through

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.920
 our bodies and it has to be in touch with our organs and it transports and transforms

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.000
 and excretes and becomes the earth and that becomes soil and a tree which would take,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:21.880
 I mean, the whole cycle of systems of interacting things that bind each other. It's not a giant

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:37.480
 open white room. These are lived embodied systems that interact with each other. And we're about

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:47.920
 to enter a time where a lot of people's time is going to not be in that realm. You put

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.440
 on the headset, you put on the ear set and you can populate a living very seemingly real

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:05.240
 world with anything you want. So what does that do to us as bodhisattvas? How do I hold

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.220
 myself accountable in that kind of boundless space? This is boundless, not in the sense

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:16.560
 of boundaries that fold into more boundaries. This is in the sense of I can do whatever

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:26.680
 I want without limit. This is not natural, boundaried systems of interdependence. This

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:37.100
 is just ego clinging without limit. And what's going to happen when we have a shared space

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:43.520
 that we co-create? Like where are the rules that you want to be a purple unicorn speaking

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:54.240
 Swahili and I'm going to translate that into Spanish as a penguin that morphs into a cactus

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:04.160
 that it's just it's about to become anything. And it's going to be normal, the norm, the

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.120
 mainstream thing. If you think it's not true, go in public and see how many people don't

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:19.400
 have a smartphone glued to their face. This is only 14 years old. It looks odd to see

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:29.000
 someone in public that doesn't have a smartphone in their hand. It looks odd. So the point

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.120
 here isn't to point fingers and say what are other people doing, but what am I going to

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.760
 do? How am I going to populate my world? How am I going to interact with my world? Because

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.760
 we're already doing that. It's just a less powerful framework in a way. We're already

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.200
 choosing to be in a place, in a time. Am I going to have kids or not? Am I going to work

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.860
 at this job or not? Am I going to respond with kindness or not? Am I going to wake up

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.760
 super stressed? Am I going to sit down and meditate? These are all choices, right? And

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:09.840
 the problem with embodied, embedded choices is that every choice involves grief, samsara,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.000
 conditioned existence. Whatever we choose, we give up all the things we didn't choose.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.500
 And there's a knowledge of that, of duality mind, like I don't get all these other options.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:30.040
 And there's like an aching there. I can't do whatever I want. I have to actually choose

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.720
 something and be with it and not be with all the other things. I have to choose a nundro

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.600
 practice, not just jump between practices, right? I have to choose a time and a place.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:51.000
 I have to be an embedded, embodied, living, dynamic being in a world where I have to care

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.440
 for the world I'm in. And I have to show up on the terms of the world and the people in

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:05.500
 it that are around me that I'm affecting, that I'm affected by. So we're already choosing

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.760
 what we train ourselves in. It doesn't have to be some video game blank thing. And then

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.000
 we get to choose what world we want to live in. That's just a very exaggerated way of

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.480
 kind of like basically letting narcissism do anything it wants. So it's a lot of power

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:29.920
 for baby mind. And there's going to be a lot of heartbreak with that and a lot of devastation.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:41.040
 Too much power. Too much power, not ready. How can I tell this? This scholar indigenous

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.840
 aboriginal person, an Appalachian clan, Tyson Yankoporta. I've been really interested in

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:53.520
 his work lately. Read his book a few years ago, Sand Talk. And in it he makes many, many,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.480
 many profound, very kind of provocative comments. Sand Talk, Tyson Yankoporta. And one thing

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:10.960
 he mentions is what are the kinds of questions that are asked by an adolescent culture? By

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:25.260
 an immature culture. Question number one, who am I? Number two, what's my purpose? Number

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:34.840
 three, what happens after I die? Why is this adolescent and immature? More mature cultures

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:43.560
 don't ask this question. Why? Because who am I? What's my purpose? What happens after

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:53.000
 I die? It's all about me. And mature cultures know there's a lot more going on in the world

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:03.320
 than just me. We happen to be in a mature culture like that. We're bodhisattvayana. What's

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:15.440
 the main bodhisattvayana question? What serves? What serves? How can I be of better service?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:24.280
 This is such a deeply mature, such a profound question. How can I care for you more thoroughly?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.640
 Because the recognition is the nature of my mind is naturally compassionate. It's naturally

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:40.960
 intelligent. It's naturally interconnected. If I serve you, it serves me. If I create

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.200
 a nourishing, flourishing situation, like I'm naturally like buoyed up and just fulfilled

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.640
 by that. This is the great Shanti Deva said that the root of every trouble is thinking

00:17:52.640 --> 00:18:01.200
 what about me? And the cause of every happiness is thinking what about you? And we've heard

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:09.120
 this so many times and it's still true. It's such deep, hardcore Vajrayana, bodhicitta.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.080
 It's the beating heart. So if we use AI in the giant big blank boundless room and we

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.360
 say how do I create a world that serves more beings? It's more educational. It's more heartfelt.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 It's more uplifting. It's more of service to whoever else shares that space. Then fine,

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.840
 AI is going to be an amazing power tool for bodhisattva activity. And there'll be some

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.000
 beings that use it like that, just like TV. TV could be the best educational tool that

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.080
 ever existed. Radio, smart phone, it's all the same. The trajectory of going of that

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.760
 oral traditions, into written traditions, into radio, into TV, into internet, smart phone,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.880
 now headset, embodied gear stuff. It's the power, we're accessing more and more power

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:06.720
 of interconnection. Technology is letting our mind have a bigger effect that's faster.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:14.560
 But are we ready for that power? Because if the main driving question is what about me?

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:21.040
 Me first. I'm so special, right? Again, this Tyson Yanka Porta says what indigenous try,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:28.240
 indigenous clans of all types, the fundamental question they've all circled around to prevent

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:38.880
 is the root thought. I'm more special. Ego clinging. Buddhism is one of these indigenous

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:46.720
 cultures. Isn't it? Tibetan Buddhism goes back to the eighth century. Indian Buddhism,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.600
 Mayana Buddhism goes back to the 600 or so, you know BCE. This is definitely an indigenous

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:04.680
 culture. It's a very ancient wisdom tradition. So what do I want to populate this world with?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.200
 We're already choosing that. Now we get a headset that really viscerally lets us see

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.520
 what choice we're making and we get feedback that comes very fast. But if we think we're

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.480
 outside of a system of cause and effect, if we think space and time doesn't matter, so

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.120
 much of our body intelligence is about space and time. What is happening around me? What

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.240
 are the cues I get? The smells, the taste, the breeze, the texture, the light, like all

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.880
 this is me in space and all this intelligence comes to locate interdependence in time and

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.760
 space. Right? The great master Nagarjuna is like, we only recognize the absolute through

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.480
 the relative, through the relational, through the relationality, the relationships, the

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.080
 connectivity

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.920
 of being an embodied, embedded mind and heart and all this gushy, messy juiciness of human

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.600
 hood. In other words, that's just human. There's insects and bugs and gundarvas and all these

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.700
 different types of beings often works. I'm so human centric. Again, we'll see what happens

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:17.000
 with that once these AI systems get much smarter than humans in terms of their computational

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.680
 ability. That's coming so fast now. High human IQ, this propositional belief structure knowledge,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.640
 high IQ for humans 120. That's about a normal average. It's a high normal. Einstein had

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:43.400
 160. The current chat GPT4 has 150. It went from 120ish to 150 in about six months. If

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:52.560
 it's on the same trajectory, six months from now, it's going to be about what? 190? Six

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.920
 months later, so a year from now, what? 320? What is it like when we're interacting with

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:05.600
 a system that has the double IQ of a human, of a normal human on the street? That's going

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:13.120
 to be like a squirrel interacting with a human, but we're the squirrel. This program, whether

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.040
 it's sentient or not, we're not even going to understand it. That's what's coming in

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.400
 a year. This is right here right now. If we thought we were going to avoid this whole

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:31.720
 thing, we're not. It's here. Just this week, all these AI systems, Google, Microsoft, and

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.200
 all these things, they've already integrated AI in all the things they use now. You don't

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.520
 have to go to some separate thing. It's in the thing. You get Microsoft Word, AI is in

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:50.600
 it. You use phone programs, the AI is in it. There's not an escape. If you use electricity,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.200
 it's here and now. The question really that I'm circling around is how to be responsible

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.080
 in the web of connections that I'm in, that I'm a part of, that make me what I am, the

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.560
 relationships. How do I be accountable in that and responsible in that? Because that's

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:14.920
 what a very foundational Buddhist, Theravada, that's such a deep, deep question. How can

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:21.400
 I show up to my circumstances properly? For Bodhisattvas, they just magnify that question

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.520
 basically without limit. What serves now for all time and space endlessly for every being

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.560
 until they're all free of suffering? It means how can I be most effective now to help Buddha

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.480
 nature turn on a little more brightly now? It's very intimate. It's very fertile and

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:46.480
 messy and very much about what is happening around me and in me right now. So there's

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.680
 some Dharma quotes around this. So here's Ajahn Chah, the great master Ajahn Chah, a

00:23:50.680 --> 00:24:01.520
 book being Dharma. And I read, "This is so helpful." When planting is page 118. When

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.280
 planting a tree, if you want to do it the right way and get fruit from it, how should

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:12.760
 you go about it in order to have a relaxed mind? You should do that which is your responsibility.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:18.480
 Getting hold of the sapling is your job. Digging the hole is your job. Planting it, fertilizing

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.680
 it and watering it and keeping the insects off, it is your job. That's it. Stop there.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:30.440
 How fast or slow it grows isn't your job. Let go of this part. You make the causes in

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.000
 planting and taking care of the tree but you don't think when will it be fully grown? When

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.360
 will there be fruit? That isn't your business. It's the plants. If you think, "I've watered

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.800
 it and all the rest, now how can I force it to grow faster?" That won't help. It isn't

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.240
 your responsibility. But there's a connection. If you've done your work properly, the tree

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.320
 is bound to grow according to nature. If you think like this, you will be okay. If you

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.440
 want it to grow in a day or two after all your hard work, that's mistaken. There's

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.920
 no happiness that way. Don't think about it too much at this point. It's a matter of

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.480
 making causes. If the causes are good, the result is bound to be good because all things

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.080
 are born of causes. We have our duties so we do them to the full. But we act without

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.300
 attachment, taking care of our own responsibilities. If we try to take care of the tree's

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.120
 responsibilities,

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.280
 we will get upset. The important thing is to make the causes good. Then the result will

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.380
 be good. If we think like this, there will be a lightness of mind. Otherwise, we are

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:43.000
 doing others' work, watching the tree today, going back to watch it tomorrow, trying to

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.380
 see it grow.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.760
 So Ajahn Chah goes on, but responsibility, accountability, knowing like what am I actually

00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:00.440
 responsible for? What have I promised? What have I committed to? Where have I really said,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:07.280
 you know, I will go deep here. I will care for this. And like trying to do that as fully

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.840
 as possible, as intelligently as possible, as carefully, as full of care as possible.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.920
 That's my responsibility. But I don't have control over the whole system. I don't get

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:23.320
 to choose all the features that populate an entire world that I'm a part of. That is very

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.840
 wishful thinking. And it's really toxic because I don't have the intelligence to make that

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.120
 choice. And there's no such being that has that omnipotence. The Buddha clearly taught

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.720
 there's no such being as an omnipotent being that doesn't that doesn't exist. Even the

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.160
 Buddha wasn't omnipotent. He was omniscient. He knew the vast network of causes and conditions

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.320
 that were called relative truth.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.400
 So knowing like, what's my responsibility? What am I caring for? And how can I plant

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.000
 the proper causes and conditions to orient towards the result that I seek, which is the

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.920
 happiness of all beings, the enlightenment of all beings. So that's one kind of way to

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:12.520
 dip in. Then I have a lot, there's a lot of quotes. So this in another way is like kind

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.640
 of sometimes for people, it's like trigger word, or it's just like a boring word or not

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:24.400
 interesting word, renunciation mind. This is what we're talking about. How do I show up

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:33.000
 in my life, actually fully and be responsible for what is on my plate? How do I take responsibility

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.720
 accountability for like my mind, my own mind, for my mind, not for the world or not for

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:46.000
 your mind, for my mind, because I have the power to actually be responsible for my mind,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.820
 which is also interesting in the AI land. Maybe some people think, Oh, what you do in there

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:57.120
 doesn't really matter. It's like a video game. You get together with your friends, you know,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.200
 you play a shooter game, you shoot each other, it's all fun and games, then you stop and

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.040
 you're like in real world. But more and more, this is not going to be true. More and more,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.240
 this is going to be the real world that people are in. And that's just normal everyday worldly

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.360
 perspective. The second thing is, from the Buddhist perspective, every instant you do

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.440
 something with your mind, it shapes the mind. Whether that's in a dream, waking, deep sleep

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.680
 in a video game, watching a movie, writing something, reading something, the mind is

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.100
 being influenced. It's the superpower of the mind. It can influence and be influenced.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:39.340
 So like, be careful what causes and conditions you put yourself in, because the mind will

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:44.760
 shape according to them.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:52.840
 So there's a quote from Zoczar Jami and Kenseter Imbache. It's a Facebook thing he did in 2020.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:59.400
 Some say the dark age, the age of vice, the Kalyuga is here now, or at least coming soon.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.000
 What determines if an age is dark or golden? What are the symptoms or omens? Earthquakes,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.160
 violet skies, meteoric activity, these are not the omens of doomsday, as we are made

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.760
 to believe. Likewise, cherubs flying, a sound economy, freedom of information, peaceful

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.460
 times are also not necessarily times of a golden age. The age of light is said to be

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.160
 when people value empathy and forgiveness, when they have a willingness to see other

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:32.540
 people's view, and are contented with what they have. When such values are systematically

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:38.260
 sabotaged, then you can say that the dawn of the doomsday has begun. When we look at

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:44.080
 a harmless beggar and see it as a pest, and envy billionaires who routinely destroy the

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:54.080
 Earth, we are inviting doomsday to come.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.280
 Again another quote from Zoczar Jami and Kenseter Imbache is on a recent talk he gave, contemporary

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:08.920
 Buddhist perspective on myth, language, globalization, and societal values. This is in 2020. Zoczar

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:17.160
 and Kenseter Imbache said, "If Buddhism boils down to don't eat meat, smile, be gentle,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:24.960
 be kind, be helpful, behave well, then Buddhism is dead. I'm sure there will be a lot of good

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:35.120
 people walking around, but there will be no Buddhists."

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:44.820
 So the third quote, again, Zoczar and Kenseter Imbache, YouTube video 2020. We talk about

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.120
 how samsara is useless, samsara is suffering, all of that, but that's not the real reason

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:57.840
 for renunciation. The real reason for renunciation of samsara is because samsara is shunyata.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.380
 It doesn't exist. There is no ignorance. There's also no end of ignorance. There is no death.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.880
 There's no end of death. There are no four noble truths. This was taught by the same

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.920
 guy who taught the four noble truths. You need to know this. This is the brilliance of Shakyamuni

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:26.920
 Buddha. This is so deep. So not only is it about being in relationality with responsibility

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.560
 and accountability, but understanding that if we really look closely enough at relationships,

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.560
 the relationality in my own mind, my own heart, my own body, with my own close ones and strangers

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.080
 and enemies and all beings, if I really look closely at that relationality, the relationship,

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:52.360
 the relative truth, I'll see that there's only relationship. I'll only ever find more

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:59.920
 vast nuanced networks of relationality. There is no fixed thing happening. It's just a dynamic

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:07.440
 interplay of cause, condition, and effect. And in Buddhism, that's called wisdom or

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:15.680
 prajna, insight. There is no fundamental thing there. Not outside, not inside, not in between.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.540
 And that's really hard for most minds. It's definitely hard for my mind. Some people call

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:26.140
 that nowadays, it's kind of trending, liminality, liminal, the in between, the bardo. Tibetan

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.280
 Buddhists talked about the bardo, that all of this life and experience is a bardo. This

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:38.840
 is baked into Tibetan Buddhist Devadriana view. Bardo in between, it's always shifting, changing.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:46.040
 Everything's amorphous. There is no fixed final frame. And that's the fundamental uncertainty

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.620
 that each mind has to come to terms with in order for it not to keep suffering. This is

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:57.320
 all uncertain. Everything's constantly moving. And we say that impermanence, impermanence,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.480
 impermanence. But how much do we really believe that? Are we really willing to be with that

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:10.760
 level of uncertainty? Because when we're not, that's the root cause of suffering. I want

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:22.360
 to be set, stable, in control, ego clinging. I do that so much all the time. I'm not saying

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.340
 I'm out of that. I'm totally in that. That's why I can talk with it, you know, like authentically

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:34.040
 a little. Suffering hurts. It really hurts. But if I look closely enough at suffering,

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:41.360
 the sufferer, right? This is where Buddhism takes the question of who am I? And it really

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:48.720
 opens that in a mature way. Who am I? There's no I there. There's no suffering there. If

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.360
 I really look closely and then what do I find? I find connection, relationality. That's why

00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:01.020
 the question of what serves is such a burning question for bodhisattvas. How can I help

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.080
 with these relationships? Like the relational network I'm a part of. Not how can I plug

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.960
 and play whatever I want to see around me and however I want to look. That's just a

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:18.000
 doomed game. It's really, we'll see. We're at the very beginning, day two. So we'll see

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.880
 where it goes. What Buddha Shakyamuni taught, we're in an age of degeneration, where the

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.480
 narrowing of mind is definitely narrowing. And if we take narcissism, for example, and

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.560
 we always put me first as the most special, important center of the universe, and then

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.080
 I can do whatever I want with these power tools, and then everyone's trying to do that,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.160
 we really will see that's not going to create a lot of harmonious collective togetherness.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:49.040
 There's going to be a lot of conflict. Or at least a whole lot of confusion. All right,

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.200
 one more quote. I mean, for right now, I'm coming, I'll wrap up. "Going into this bodhicitta

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.840
 or the kind of burning heart of the bodhisattva yana, the bodhisattva path, those courageous

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.320
 for enlightenment, for all beings." And this is a quote of Venerable Kempa Ramache from

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:14.320
 Illuminating the Path. This is the Dijam Terasarnandra book. It's page 93. This is such a powerful,

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.400
 powerful quote, such a special book. "Without bodhicitta, there are no Buddhas, bodhisattvas

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.880
 or enlightenment. There's only confusion based on ego games and selfishness. If we do not

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:31.160
 have bodhicitta, we are not actually taking refuge, even if we go through the motions.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.240
 Without it, our efforts are forced, uptight, and meaningless. With bodhicitta, we acquire

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.760
 skillful means. We become kind and gentle, and our practice becomes more powerful, beneficial,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:48.080
 and beautiful. When Buddha Shakyamuni was alive, there was a famous king named Prasanajit who

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.800
 ruled much of northern India from his capital in Shrivasti. He was very devoted to the Buddha,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.720
 but did not have a lot of time to practice because of his worldly duties. His heart was

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.160
 with the Buddha, but he couldn't connect deeply with the Dharma. This worried him. So one day,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.480
 he asked the Buddha what to do. The Buddha said, "If you can do only one practice, you will be

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.210
 applying yourself all the time." "What would that be?" asked the king. "It is generating bodhicitta

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:16.360
,"

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.800
 said the Buddha. "Bring bodhicitta into each of your daily activities, whether you're standing,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.920
 walking, sitting, or sleeping. While you're governing the kingdom or whatever you're doing,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.920
 if you keep bodhicitta in your heart, it will transform all of your actions into the practice

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:40.480
 of the Dharma." Then again, from illuminating the path, page 96, Patra Rinpoche also said

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.360
 that without bodhicitta, so this is the reverse side, so that was the sweet uplifting. This is

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.640
 the reverse, the little strong. Patra Rinpoche also said that without bodhicitta firmly established

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.480
 in your heart, even if you've memorized the zogchen tantras and can quote all the Mahamudra

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:01.840
 texts, you're merely paying lip service to the Dharma. He said that no matter how vast your

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.960
 view is, without bodhicitta, whatever you say is the doctrine of demons. He felt strongly about

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.520
 this, saying that people who talk about their experiences of bliss and emptiness and bhatriyana

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.740
 practice without having bodhicitta as a foundation should have their mouths stuffed with the

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.080
 garbage

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:30.280
 of nine cities. Bodhicitta, right? That's the answer. And then the next little thing, quote,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:39.040
 this is from B. Allen Wallace. In his book, Attention Revolution, page 150, "We have two

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:46.280
 challenges that are at the heart of zogchen. Do not let the vision be buried by your life,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:53.720
 by economics, politics, and so on. Do not let the vision get lost while you're cut up in what

00:37:53.720 --> 00:38:01.720
 happens on a day-to-day basis. This is the first challenge. The second is do not let your vision of

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.940
 the middle way, the vision of the great perfection, stifle your interest in day-to-day affairs,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.720
 your

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:14.480
 life, your family, the political situation, among others. Do not let vision exclude life situations

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:22.720
 as if they did not matter because they do. Keep in mind this expression, stillness in front of the

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:32.640
 movement." Stillness in front of the movement. So like how can I be accountable, responsible? How

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.560
 can I hold my feet to the fire? What does that even mean? How can I show up in my life in a way

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.800
 that actually cares about my life and it cares about the people around me? And I care about this

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.040
 continuing in a lovely way and I care about the lineage and I care about the teachings being

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:57.040
 preserved. Like how can I do that? I have to pay attention to them but in a light way, in an open

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:04.000
 way, a spacious way, but it actually means I have to listen to them. I do have to listen to others.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.800
 I have to listen to what's happening. I have to pay attention and slow down and wait. What's

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:15.920
 going on in the situation? What's going on in my mind? I have to like patiently like give myself

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:22.560
 the time and space to be with what is happening. Not to just make it however I want it, but to

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:31.440
 actually be with the world. Be in the world with it. Be with people as they are, but not get so

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.560
 tense around who they are and who I am and what's the relationship. Do it with a big view.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.720
 This is just a moment we share. How can bring some buoyancy, brightness, loveliness to this

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.600
 little fleeting moment? This is becoming a memory as it happens and it's a memory I'll soon forget,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.960
 but it's still going to have an imprint on my mind and my heart. It's still going right into

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.280
 my alaya, the Buddha nature, and is it going to uncover it and make my Buddha nature shine

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.680
 more brightly? Or is it going to cover my Buddha nature and kind of wrap myself in more wounds and

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:16.800
 more scars and more kind of distorted closed view perception? So time's at the end for this.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:25.360
 Really, this book is so sweet. A flash of lightning in the dark of night, a guide to the

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.480
 bodhisattva's way of life with a commentary by his Holiness Dalai Lama. The translation of the

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.440
 shanti deva's bodhicharya avatara, the bodhisattva way of life. It's so beautiful. It's so

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.920
 beautiful

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.360
 in this book. So I wanted to read one. I mean, it's the translation. It's so beautiful.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.600
 But this is his Holiness Dalai Lama speaking about bodhichitta. He's worked so hard at such

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:56.640
 a dire time for the Tibetan people for so many decades. And then quote page 97.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.040
 When people say that I have worked a lot for peace, I feel embarrassed.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:10.320
 I feel like laughing. I don't think that I've done very much for world peace.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:16.480
 It's just that my practice is the peaceful path of kindness, love, compassion, and not harming

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.600
 others. This has become part of me. It's not something for which I have specially volunteered.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.720
 I'm simply a follower of the Buddha. And the Buddha taught that patience is the supreme means

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:36.240
 for transcending suffering. He said, if a monk harms others, he is not a monk. I am a Buddhist

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.960
 monk. So I try to practice accordingly. When people think this practice is something unique

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:48.320
 and special and call me a leader of world peace, I almost feel ashamed. A good heart is the source

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:54.480
 of all happiness and joy. And we can all be good hearted if we make an effort. But better still is

00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:01.040
 to have bodhichitta, which is a good heart imbued with wisdom. It is the strong desire to attain

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.040
 enlightenment in order to deliver all beings from suffering and bring them to Buddhahood.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.840
 This thought of helping others is rooted in compassion, which grows from a feeling of

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.040
 gratitude and love for beings who are afflicted by suffering.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.160
 Traditionally, there are two methods for developing this sort of care and gratitude.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:24.000
 One is to reflect on the fact that all beings have at some time in the succession of their lives

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 been our parents or at least close friends, so that we naturally feel grateful to them

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.660
 and wish to take on their suffering in exchange for our happiness. The other method is to

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:36.720
 understand

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.120
 that others suffer in the same way as we do, to see that we are all equal and to reflect on what

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:49.680
 is wrong with egotism and on the advantages of altruism. We can use whichever of these two

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:56.800
 methods suits us best or practice them both together. So this is equalizing, exchanging,

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.000
 and eventually seeing others is more important. This is so core of the way of the bodhisattva.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.640
 So when we get in our AI simulation, which is definitely coming, if you think you're going to

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:14.800
 be one of the people in the public sphere who doesn't have a headset on engaging with this

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.320
 a couple years from now, just recognize if you're one of the people now who

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.120
 doesn't have a smartphone in your hand all the time when you're with people.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.000
 We happen to be at a hermitage place where that's kind of rare here

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.280
 because Wi-Fi is bad and we intentionally keep it bad.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.600
 What happens when you just can't do whatever you want? You have to actually pay it to slow

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.080
 down and show up to like, "What's happening around me already? How can I listen and tune

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.560
 in to what's actually around me?" And not just change it the way I want to change it.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.560
 I use the internet all the time. I'm sure I'll try out the headset thing. If we can use this

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.640
 to creatively co-create beautiful, uplifted, mutually, reciprocally, just nourishing bodhicitta

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:12.240
 full context, containers, worlds, communications, art, technological innovations, I'm totally for

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:18.720
 it. That's the very positive side of this time. If you have bodhisattvas using this kind of thing,

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:26.240
 the outreaching bodhicitta activity is enhanced. But if it's just selfishness that's empowered to

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:35.320
 do what it wants more, that's the kind of opaque narrow side of the power, this kind of inter

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:35.920
connectivity.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.680
 So then holding my own feet to the fire, I actually have to pay attention to the relations

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.720
 that I'm a part of because that's actually where I have so much power to be influenced by them and

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:54.800
 to influence, to really learn. And then what's this part? By joyfully choosing or embracing

00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:02.880
 voluntary simplicity, I have to choose to go deep here. None of us can go do everything we want all

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:09.680
 the time. We have to actually grow some roots somewhere if we want to go deep. That's voluntary

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:19.120
 simplicity. We choose, consciously choose to care for something, a relationship, a quality of mind,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:27.840
 a practice, a lineage. We're choosing to grow it, to really care for it, and we can't force it to

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:35.280
 grow fast. It'll do what it does. It's a vast web of cause, condition, and effect. But we can

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:42.880
 definitely take responsibility for our part in that, our loving touch of being embodied in touch

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:50.690
 with living systems that we're a part of right now. So thank you all. That's kind of, to some

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.960
 degree,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:57.360
 a plea, and then also to some degree, just a beautiful kind of pause to reconnect to these

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.400
 core essential teachings of the Buddha. And now we'll kind of go in this very incubator

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:09.040
 context of the Dujum Ter Cernundro, where we get to hold ourselves accountable to this lineage

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:15.440
 system that's just designed for us to brighten all of our Buddha nature activities and qualities.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.200
 So really genuinely thank you, and thanks for kind of this opportunity to practice together

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.120
 this, these sacred sublime teachings.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:39.280
 Can I say a final little wrap up? That's great. Thank you. Thank you all.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:51.040
 Isn't it just so tender to be us? I find it very tender to be a human being, and at this time too,

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:57.760
 but just now, it's just a tender thing. And I think part of why it's, part of the

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:06.000
 specialness of it is it's just really vulnerable. It's vulnerable to be in a body with a mind

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.760
 that's so sensitive. It has so much capacity to tune in to what's happening around, outside,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:20.800
 inside. It's so sensitive, and it's that vulnerability, the sensitivity, like that's actually

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.240
 kind of where we recognize we're a part of something so much bigger than ourselves.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:36.000
 Like we're deeply connected with this living world and all these living peace people and

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.840
 relationships. And when we like kind of recognize that like the power or the kind of like the

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.160
 beauty

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:51.680
 of it is like in the, it's in the kind of connecting and in the interweaving. That's actually where

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:51.840
 like

00:47:51.840 --> 00:48:00.560
 the Dharma I think kind of really is alive. And so as Dharma people, as Buddhists, we also have

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:08.000
 these living ecologies that we're a part of. And they're lineage ecologies. And that's part of the

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.930
 power and beauty and strength of practitioners. We have the support of all these lineage structures

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.080
.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.640
 And there's a beautiful quote by Tinley Novarumice. It's a short quote, and it's really

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:25.760
 powerful and impactful for me. It's in his book, "Ruby Rosary," Tinley Novarumice. And it says,

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:34.080
 page 230, "For those of us who presume to be followers of the Buddha, if we can each perfect

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:40.740
 our learning and contemplation within a particular yana that corresponds to our individual

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.120
 faculties

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:49.120
 and inclinations with its own threefold system of basis, path and result, then even though it may

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.640
 seem as if we've not served the Buddha's teachings in vast ways, in fact, it is the most beneficial

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.760
 and not allowing the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni to be contradicted or ruined from within."

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.720
 So whatever corner of reality of the world that we happen to be in, wherever our home is, wherever

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:18.720
 our body is, if we can care for it on like how it is in relationship to what it's a part of,

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:26.800
 and in this living context of a lineage, if we can within a yana, if we can like stay with a view,

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:35.200
 meditation, conduct, and fruition of that specific yana and not break it to actually show up on the

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.200
 terms of what the living system is that we're a part of, then that's the doorway to liberation.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:51.280
 But if we aren't vulnerable and instead we try to just only control our situation or kind of

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:58.080
 overstep the bounds, the boundaries of like what a living ecology actually takes to continue,

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:07.120
 if we're kind of reckless in that, then it won't sustain. It's actually in the surrendering to

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.160
 like the living system that we're a part of, that's actually where we get to be connected

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.200
 with everything that exists, and like that's kind of the doorway into emptiness or interdependence.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.640
 So thank you. We're deeply ecological beings, like in every way we look at it,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.760
 and so thanks for being a part of this living system. So happy. Thank you.
