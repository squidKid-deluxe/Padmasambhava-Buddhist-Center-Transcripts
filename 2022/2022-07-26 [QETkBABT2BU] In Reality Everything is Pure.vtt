00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.760
 The next is the next of the pure appearance and the premodial wisdom, the premodial pure expenses

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.800
 of some of the body, the spontaneous air complex trigger of the zocchim, the sharp weather of the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.010
 awareness tantra, the contents of the great sacred mandrayanas, mandrayanas, so those are the four

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 titles.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.060
 So according to the linear masters, when they go through this and what they say, always divide at

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.000
 least three portions of this teaching into three.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.230
 First and second and third also. The first is title. Second is the principle of the text in the

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 teaching. Third is the concluding or the colorful.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 You also ask for this teaching has that too. I mean all those. And so first is the title.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And the title is actually, without teaching or those great masters often say it's so important

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 because it really has captured the essence meaning of the entire text or the teaching itself.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.800
 So therefore, it is so important. At the same time, it is important to discover and to connect to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.000
 this teaching and to obtain this book quickly knowing the titles and all these reasons.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.970
 So now we go with this meaning of the titles. So now what is said here, this teaching, if I look at

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.000
 our view, the overview of the bird's eye of this title,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 and as I said, there is also this commentary by well-known scholar Alan Wallace. I'm sure you read

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.000
 that already there.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 But I'll go over this as this. So where does this teaching come from? This teaching comes from the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 "ness of the pure awareness."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Pure awareness, primordial wisdom. That is the source of these teachings. What came from there?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.080
 Then it came the primordial pure expression of the summoner's body and the spontaneous air-confront

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:20.000
al material of the looking.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And then what is that teaching is what? That is the shout whether of the awareness mantra.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And that is the essence of all the tantra teachings. That's what the principal is explaining.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:03:02.270
 Or the principal or the essence of the meaning. Now we go to the pure ever-translated, SI-trans

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.000
lated evidence from the nets of the pure vision or pure appearance and the wisdom.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.670
 So that is the pure vision. So in the Tibetan first, it's called pure vision. So now, as I said

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.000
 yesterday, I said it's true. At least I'm comparing it to myself.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.230
 It's not true. Because this pure vision is not just this time, this pure vision is not just

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.000
 occasionally arising appearance or the vision.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 It's not that delusion also is pure. Pure vision is also not delusions. It's not toxic-headed.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.320
 Toxic-headed vision or it's causing some certain things and we have some different visions or

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.000
 different hearings.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.450
 This vision is also not just only vision by eyesight. It's all the object of the five senses or the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.000
 six senses.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 What are the five senses or six senses? The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and the sixth is mind.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.220
 So the vision of the sixth senses is pure. Pure means what? As I said already, it's not toxic-

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.000
headed, not delusion, pure or temporary vision.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.390
 It is pure, preformed dualities. Preformed dualities. That this vision or this appearance is

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.000
 appearance of the Buddha.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:56.430
 Of great bodies that appear is always pure. Always pure because their inner obscuration is played

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.000
 with it.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Therefore, their senses are verbatim status, not deluded, obscured duality senses as we do at.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It's pure, completely. That's the teaching also, for example.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 If we have this completely clear way our duality is, this universe where we are now is pure then.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 This very is really pure then. That is something pure then you have to go, "Ah, great."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.970
 And what the great Master and King said, "The moment you purify or we purify our duality, right

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:50.000
 that moment heaven is here, opulent is here."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.160
 And again, this is one of the last teachings, or maybe last phrase, when a student said that, in

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.000
 him or in the teaching said,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.050
 "The beautiful, pure range, beautiful, comfortable, pure vision is right here." Really? Only the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.000
 duality one.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.740
 This is, again, in the Buddha teaching said too. I mean, of course, in the old Buddha teaching,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.000
 there's many throughout them, but in the Buddha teaching,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 during the time of the great teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni is giving the teachings.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 At that time, this one Bodhisattva came, known as Shungmu Rabatyate. Shungmu Rabatyate Bodhisattva

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 came for the other building of other realms, the universe,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.200
 to receive the teaching directly from Buddha Shatyamuni and to see and stay in his presence, his

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.000
 presence with Buddha Shatyamuni's presence.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:04.580
 So when this great Bodhisattva came, Shari Buddha asked, "How is yoke that land? It's beautiful or

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.000
 how it is? It's similar like here?"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.940
 He said, and Shungmu Rabatyate answered, "My place is completely pure. Pure, everything is from

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.000
 silicon, enlightened status.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 There's no difficulty challenging the tapas at all, is it? Is it?"

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.170
 Then Shari Buddha answered, "My, it's my pure land, our pure land of the Buddha Hekamuni is not

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.000
 like that, like this.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.930
 There's so many difficulty challenging the tapas and also the earth, the land are not completely

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.000
 kind of so nice and soothing things.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 There's so many ruins, so many thorns and so many dirt, all these things they say there."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.490
 Then Shungmu Rabatyate asked, "No, your pure land is so beautiful, perfectly. It's the same as

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.000
 where I come from, the beautiful pure land."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.490
 So now it's really completely, directly against the Shari Buddha's statement with these new

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.000
 visitors.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 From the aliens, maybe we call these aliens. So this alien statement, he said that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 So now what happened? Then Shari Buddha said, "To gracious Buddha, is this true? Our pure land is

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 pure like that, what he's saying is true?"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.920
 And Buddha immediately, magical person forward, he opened in the door, door in the window to see

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.000
 the other universe, other pure lands, and far away.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.870
 And also all the land is pure, that land is so pure and so beautiful, so soothing and so nice and

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.000
 like that.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.530
 And then Buddha said to the audience of the students, and he included Shari Buddha, "Can you see

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.000
 that?"

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 They said, "Yes, great Lord, great Master, I quickly can see that."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 He said, "My pure land, where I am, is the same, same, no difference, except where we are."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.210
 Or those people who are here, in pure, they all have duality, or you have duality cataracts,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.000
 because you don't see them.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 So this is really what he called in the teaching, reality is pure, everything.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.710
 For that reason, in the Dzogin Tantal or the Megha Tantalism, what is it? We always heard that in

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.000
 the teaching.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.200
 Five aggregates are enlightened. Five aggregates. This means not just five aggregates, but the

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.000
 Buddha's five aggregates.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Our five aggregates, our form is enlightened. Our feeling aggregate is enlightened.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Our perception aggregate is enlightened. Our conception aggregate is enlightened.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Our consciousness is enlightened. And then, what is it? All five elements are enlightened.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 In that same mind, or in the same chapter, five elements. So that means sky is enlightened.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:30.400
 Earth is enlightened. And wind or fire is enlightened. Water is enlightened. And wind is

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.000
 enlightened.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 They are five female Buddha, those are the teachings. Five aggregates are five male Buddha.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.410
 Five elements are five female Buddhas. Our senses and octave senses, our bodies are four male and

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.000
 female.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.990
 So this is not just talking or joking, or only that certain group is reserved with that realization

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.000
 or that understanding.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 No! Reality and everything is enlightened.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 One in the Dzogin Tantal teaching or Megha Tantal teaching said, even Buddha is looking, something

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 is not pure, but not fine.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 There is nothing to you, it's impure. Everything is enlightened.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 So this is what, for that reason, in Dzogin Tantal, called the Jyut Lamma, is a subtle teaching.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.580
 What is the essence or conventional teachings of the Dathangabha teachings, teachings that Buddha

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.000
 taught in that material.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.840
 Material, known as Jyut Lamma, or in the Dharat Tantal, in Sanskrit, or in Supreme Tantra, which is

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:59.000
 not exactly Tantra, but is the teachings on the Dathangabha, so is Tantra, called Tantra.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And that teaching said, how that is said is, for example, how our perception is, our perception.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.840
 Impure perception, impure perception, and mixed perception, that means pure and impure mixed

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.000
 perception and very pure perceptions, perfect perceptions.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Who they are, and the teaching said, the impure perception we sent in Binsa has impure perceptions.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 We all, because we are deluded. We have the impure perceptions.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.200
 That means our mind is deluded, therefore our object is deluded. Subject and object, you see, all

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.000
 deluded.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Then mixture, pure and impure perception, who has the body cells.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Because they are process of the cleanings, all very kind of obscurations, duality mind.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So therefore, they have another kind of more elevated, more different perceptions than us.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And then pure perception, that means ultimate perception as it is our, that is Buddha's.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 That's why when we visualize the deities, for example, visualization, it's powerful methods,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 instantly connected to the ordinary pure state of where things are, called visualization.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.490
 Even though it's mentally kind of like fabricated things, teachings, but reality is lined up to the

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.000
 exactly, so therefore it's a skillful means.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 What is the visualization we do? We visualize our body, it's a Buddha.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.630
 Not just a body, that means our feelings and senses, and perception, conceptual, all is in the

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.000
 Buddha state.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.850
 Buddha's state, not body has become singled out, and then our, I'm going to get, the only body is

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.000
 kind of enlightened,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 and the rest, just left as we, no, we left that baggage outside somewhere.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So we take whole baggage together, whole wire again put together, and become enlightened.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 This is the reality situation, according to teaching. It's not just, we're making up.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.390
 Why we, this is what we don't see, because we wandered from the duality, we carried the force of

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.000
 the duality that we created,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 and carried away for a long time. Now we're returning back to the old and the home best,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.530
 by the teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Hekta Muni, and as well as all these great master's

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.000
 teachers, we're returning back.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.190
 How wonderful, how awesome, how uplifting, I'm not kidding, you're not just, I'm saying the whole

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.000
 thing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 But you really think carefully, very precious, very beautiful.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.110
 Really, we've got the rarest, the rarest precious opportunities, that we are really surrounded, we

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.000
 are saturated.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 How lucky, how fortunate we are. So this is what really, only like that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.140
 And then we visualize the Buddha, we visualize, then we'll say, the entire universe is transformed,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.000
 the pure land of that Buddha.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 The universe, not transformed, it arises there, it's not just something there.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 For our kind of way of thinking, it looks like it starts forming, but it arises now,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 the way the nature's beauty shines up, shines, it's so beautiful, so nice.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 That's what it really is. So this is called pure vision.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 When you have that pure vision, or pure appearance, realization, then what is that?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Is, versatile. That is versatile.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.730
 This wisdom is also not the wisdom of the dualities in the world, what we call the intelligence of

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.000
 wisdom.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 We have that too. But this time, wisdom has no dualities.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 No dualities, wisdom. It's wisdom free from the dualities.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Perfect enlightenment. That is the wisdom.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.220
 And that is the, those enlightenment, wisdom, that is enlightenment, that's the environment, is in

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.000
 that status.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 When that appears, how that appears, not solid, not conquered, conquered, that is duality.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 The nature is, according to the teaching, so flexible, so open, so mellow, there's no restrictions.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Can be anything, can be fire, can be water, if I use the gross example, water can be fire.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Fire can be water or wind, in all that mellow, flexible.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.420
 It's so flexible, because of that flexible nature, even modern scientists think, discover those

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.000
 things.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 We use those technologies, and stay here, right here, and talk to the other side of the conference,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 other side of the world, and going in the sky, and all these things.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Nature is flexible, that we, because of the skills and methodism, reading, we are taking advantage.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Nature is so flexible, that's why we are here, we said, "Nats, nets, isn't that?"

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 That means, this wisdom and view of perception, view of realization, it's totally mango.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Totally, it's a union, if I use, for inseparable status.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.870
 And if I say, also another way, I can't, to simplify it, another way I explain, this view of

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:30.000
 imagination, view of appearance is compassion, great compassion.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And the wisdom is blessings, and the union of that is net.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Union of the wisdom and compassion arise these teachings.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 It's all teachings.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 This compassion is also not just compassion or ritual.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 It's compassion, no dualities.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Those two compassion are what?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Because compassion has no attachment.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Pervasive compassion. Pervasive wisdom. And that is what? Yeah, worship.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Then those worship can be divided, or divided with those worship.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So this is what really, this is the source of that.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 So that indicate, the great master, Duryu Gumpa, is already in that great enlightened status.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 That great enlightened status.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 From that, then these teachings arise, this teaching, teaching of this one.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And that's what I said here.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And here, three different, I will talk this first three, kind of highlight that.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And this is from that net, or from that net.
