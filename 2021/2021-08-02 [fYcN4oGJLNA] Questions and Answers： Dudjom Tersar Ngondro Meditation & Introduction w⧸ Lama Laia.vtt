00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 So, again, welcome. So good and beautiful to be together, to practice these really essential

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 teachings. Like I mentioned earlier, I know many of us have been gathering here on Saturdays,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.040
 as well as maintaining our own personal practice. So vital to have our own individual practice

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.560
 and so beautiful, too, when the Sangha can come together and support each other with group

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.700
 practice, as well as discussion and reflection, and of course, to hear the teachings. So really

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 special. And then that we can make this time, both in our individual days, as well as a Sangha,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.000
 to really come together and do that. So great, so beautiful. It's truly like Rinpoche has

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.640
 mentioned many times, is actualizing the six paramitas. We all know directly in our own

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 experience, we all have our ups and downs, busy external stuff, busy internal stuff,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.480
 and to actually take the time to let go, allow ourselves to touch home base with the practice.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.360
 So beautiful, so precious, that's what we're doing. I think everyone knows that "Nundro"

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.520
 is what we're focusing on here. "Nundro" is a Tibetan word, means what goes before or

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.440
 what's the ground, what's the essence, what's the vital essence of our practice. The "Nundro"

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.600
 practices are embodying all the practices we'll ever do in Tibetan Buddhism, which means

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 within the whole of Buddhism, there's nothing left out, embodies all the teachings. It's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.640
 very pure and simple, and we have this beautiful practice given to us from His Holiness, Dodra

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 Rinpoche, which is so concise, and so rich. So we have so many practice texts, and so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.520
 many commentaries by great, realized living masters, including our own, Kenchenpold and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.760
 Shera Rinpoche, Kenpo Sei Londong Yu Rinpoche, also Dodra Rinpoche has many, Dilgo Kiense,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.320
 so many great commentaries. Patro Rinpoche really encourage everyone to really study

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.160
 those and take them to our mind and heart, that's what we're all trying to do and bring

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 to our practice. So this is primarily practice time, with a little bit of reflection on the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.680
 essence according to our capacities. We've been doing this for a few weeks here now,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.280
 and we have encouraged people to write in with questions, and many people have, and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.880
 we've been busy here, so I'm sorry we haven't necessarily replied, we've answered a few

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.640
 during our session, so we just thought since we're kind of going into now at least another

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.520
 month of continuous meeting on Saturday to kind of go over some of the questions that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.440
 have come up, and if people have more, you can definitely write. Now where did my little

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:50.760
 question sheet go? Uh oh. Where are you? How interesting. Well, we'll see what I can remember,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.400
 and maybe it will turn up here somewhere in this. I printed one from Ken, which is a very

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.960
 nice question, and I'll say a little bit, and of course Lama Drapa is here too, we've

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.540
 been kind of, because our time is limited, I found it, time to take turns a little bit

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.040
 each week, but since these are kind of answering some questions, of course, Lama Drapa please,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:29.680
 if there's something to add. Many people wrote in asking about prostrations, so maybe what

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.280
 we'll do is when we get to that part in the practice, we'll try to have the camera so

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.680
 people can see the full, but there are a few different ways of doing prostrations. Again,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.840
 prostrations are with our body, the expression of our body, and with our speech, and with

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.960
 our mind, especially Ping, just reflecting on the beautiful qualities, abilities, power

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:08.920
 of the three jewels, the three roots, and our joy and devotion towards knowing more

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.680
 about that. And then with the actual outer expression of prostrations, yes there are

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.160
 three, there's a few different ways, there's full prostrations and half prostrations. I'm

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.200
 not going to maybe take the time getting up and moving the camera and stuff now, so when

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.800
 we get to that part of our practice, we'll try to make sure the camera can see. But the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.640
 main thing with prostrations is if you can do the full prostrations, which is how we'll

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.080
 be doing during the session today, that's the most ideal. And again, according to your

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.880
 capacities and according to your body's health and everything like that, I think we all can

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.880
 be honest with ourselves about what those are. So we don't want to push ourselves into

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:07.000
 injury, but also we don't want to hold back by just a little bit of just normal discomfort.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.680
 So if you can do full prostrations, that's great. If for some reason due to physical

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.680
 things, then modifying that is fine. If you can't do prostrations at all, in general what

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:29.520
 Rinpoche says is to actually make up for that in your accumulations with Vajrasattva practice.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.000
 So maybe that's all I'll say for the moment that's addressing those questions. Most of

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.800
 them are just about how they're done. But yeah, most important is again, our motivation

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.360
 and to whatever our ability following the lineage instructions to the best we can. Like Kimpo

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.000
 Sei Wong Rinpoche has said, and it's a very good instruction in regard to our practice,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.960
 we don't want to always be sneaking in the side door, but really take the grand entry

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.800
 into the great stadium of our practice, not just sneaking in the side exit and taking

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:16.000
 shortcuts all the time. But again, we have to be real and honest with our practice little

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.880
 by little. So if anyone has specific questions, please write and ask. I'm just an ordinary

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.240
 another Sangha member. So if there's questions in modifying your practice, maybe you can

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.280
 write and ask directly and then we'll check with Rinpoche. And then many people, even though

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.240
 we've said a few times, have asked about, "Oh, I've heard you need to receive the reading

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.800
 transmission and empowerment to practice nundra. Can I join the Saturday practices?" So the

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.600
 answer is, "Yes, please join." And that's coming from Kimpo Sei Wong. Don Yo Rinpoche

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.200
 is so happy. People are interested in practicing because again, this is such vital essential

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.400
 practice, truly so beautiful and powerful to really connect our minds and hearts with.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.960
 So he strongly encourages. And then of course, the practice lineage is that when we can,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:27.140
 we definitely receive empowerments for practices we do and the reading transmission for practices

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:36.080
 we do. And of course, the instructions and apply them. But so when circumstances allow

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.320
 for people to come here, receive that from Kimpo Rinpoche or once he's able to travel

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.120
 more from another qualified lineage master, do that. But please don't feel you have to

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:56.800
 wait to join the practices. Study, join that. It has Rinpoche's blessings.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:04.520
 And then another question was about repetitions. And once we get to the actual practice of

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.880
 the nundra we'll do in a little bit, we do repeat. We have these seven sections that

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:19.440
 make up the practice and we repeat them as you know. And the questions are, "Oh, is

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.840
 it a set way?" Meaning we have, of course, this is coming to us in Tibetan. And then

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:33.160
 we have English translation. So here we generally do, because we have a little more time, like

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.920
 three Tibetan, three recitations in Tibetan, three times in English, or even more sometimes,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.040
 less, but it's not fixed. If you have time to do Tibetan in English, great. If you have

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.640
 time to only do English, that's fine. If you can do Tibetan and English, that's nice too.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.680
 If you know the Tibetan, you can connect with the meaning. Connecting with the meaning,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.560
 reflecting on the meaning and letting all the practice and study we've done land with

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.600
 our practice as we're reciting is the most important. So again, don't feel you have to

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:21.300
 do exactly as we do during these sessions. It can definitely modify. You can do one Tibetan,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:33.600
 two English. However, I think I answered that. With accumulations, definitely. Am I going

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:41.920
 to? Accumulations, I think many people know, once we're familiar with the nundra practice,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.760
 another really major part of the practice lineage is that we do accumulations of the

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.200
 nundra, which means we have some goals with how long we're really spending to steep and

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:03.160
 dwell and absorb and let be with the practice, with the view, with the meditation, with the

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:13.680
 practice. And with that is accumulations. So generally that's 100,000 accumulations

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.480
 of each section of the nundra. So for example, people have asked, well, what counts as one

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.160
 and what counts as this and that. So I'll just go through the main sections. So we start

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.760
 with refuge. So generally when we're doing refuge, that's when we're accumulating our

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:42.640
 prostrations. So with each time we do a prostration with the refuge that's counting as one. One

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:51.200
 prostration with one recitation is one. And then so we can set a goal for how many we can

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.680
 do in five minutes or oh, I'm going to do one mala of prostrations with refuge. So that's

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:05.120
 it. And then bodhicitta, what we're accumulating is the recitation with that motivation or

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:13.200
 bodhicitta vow. So each time we're reciting those lines counts as one and then we each

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.440
 so one recitation, one, two recitations, two. And then with the mandala offering, each time

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.440
 we're offering the mandala with the recitation, that's what we're accumulating. Each time we

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:34.080
 offer that counts as one, the second time, two, etc. And then ideally when we're doing

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:43.280
 our accumulations, that's with the mandala plate. The next section just going through

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.760
 the nundra is the Vajrasattva. And so what we're accumulating there is 100,000 of the

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.600
 long Vajrasattva mantra, the 100 syllable Vajrasattva mantra with the meditation, etc.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.680
 Connecting with the instructions and the meaning. And then when we get to the guru yoga,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.640
 even though like we may recite, we visualize ourselves as "yashe sojal" with Guru Rinpoche

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:17.200
 before us and recite that beautiful supplication three times to Guru Rinpoche. Then again,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.120
 with all the instructions, visualization, what we're accumulating is the recitation of the

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:31.440
 Vajra Guru mantra, "O Mahon Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hom." So that's the real heart of that

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:38.320
 accumulation practice is reciting the Vajra Guru mantra. So one Vajra Guru mantra counts as one,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.920
 and if you go 108 is one mala, and then you set your goal with that and keep track.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.600
 So those are the five sections we're accumulating with that.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.640
 And then this is the question I thought was really interesting. I mean,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.280
 they're all interesting, but this has a lot of juiciness to it.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:20.320
 Accumulation of merit section ends with complete two accumulations. So I think this is referring

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.980
 to the mandala, the body's enjoyments, possessions and glories of the succession of all my lif

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.600
etimes

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.400
 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations. And then Ken is saying,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.280
 "I believe that accumulations here refers to skillful means and wisdom which develop along

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:49.120
 with each other." That's true. And then just asking a little bit more about skillful means.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.040
 So yeah, I think one part there, because I think it came up in another conversation,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:06.320
 I actually overheard here, but just, yes, we are in our practice, the whole path is accumulating.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:13.440
 The two accumulations is referring to accumulation of merit, accumulation of wisdom,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:24.400
 and accumulation of merit can be understood too as accumulation of skillful means.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.680
 And I'll get to that. But I think the important thing that I think Ken brought up here is that

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:40.880
 we're not waiting to develop our wisdom until we develop our skillful means, or accumulate our

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:47.680
 merit, or vice versa. They're really, like they say in the lineage, like two bird wings. We're

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:59.520
 accumulating our merit as we're accumulating our wisdom. They support each other. And here,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:10.320
 accumulation of merit is really referring to positive karma is one way. Using our conceptual

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:19.840
 mind to, again, do what? Refrain from harm. Engage in what's benefiting, nurturing, centering

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:28.640
 ourselves and others. Kind of knowing, becoming more and more attuned to what's helpful and what's

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:38.400
 harmful within the different contexts and experiences we come upon in life. And engaging with

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.400
 things that are positive, which means that it's based on a positive outlook.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:51.760
 You know, one based on, again, our joy, appreciation, our trust, and our goodness qualities,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.880
 and those of others. Based in our bodhicitta, and our purity, motivation, and devotion.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.440
 That's skillful means. And then is accumulation of merit. And then we have the skillful means,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:17.920
 the more and more we're attuned to the truth of cause and effect, and of interdependence.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:26.640
 The more, especially the more our wisdom is shining and unimpeded, then the more,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.480
 like in examples of Guru Patma Sambhaava, Buddha Shakyamuni, Yeshe Sojal, these great,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:41.600
 realized, enlightened ones, then that's true, the perfection of discipline, really,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.800
 the paramita of discipline. Because it's being very attuned to what's going to be most

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.040
 beneficial for as many, all the various ways of seeing and perceiving

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:04.160
 for the benefit of others. And then we have, we've been given through these great wisdom practices,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:13.920
 these practices, which are skillful means, the Vajrayana is especially known as it's the skillful

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:27.120
 means infused with bodhicitta and joy, devotion, contentment, that really is so catalyzing and

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.400
 activating. It can really purify very quickly and bring out a lot of good qualities in an

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:48.240
 accelerated manner. It's very powerful, these practices we're doing,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.080
 like the mandala offering itself in the example. It's really connecting with that generosity,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:01.680
 motivation, but then through the wisdom of our great teachers, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.960
 Guru Padmasambhava, this is like using, it seems so simple, but putting all these

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:17.120
 ingredients together is creating these great karmic ripples and reverberations that helps

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.600
 to bring more and more positive circumstances to feed our positive cause, to purify more,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.520
 remove our obscurations more, bring out our bodhicitta and our Buddha nature more

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.840
 and more beautifully. So I think I'm kind of running out of a little time because our main

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:48.720
 point is to practice. So those are just a few thoughts with those questions. Sorry, my mind

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.280
 solved the time and so I kind of clamped down a little bit there at the end of that,

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.080
 but I completed my thought, I believe. Can I mention some real quick? Yes, please. So skillful

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:04.160
 means in general, there's different ways to unpack it, but in one way it's holding our mind

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.800
 in place. So we're intentionally kind of like making our mind and our hearts stay put in a way.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:18.160
 And what's skillful about it is it helps us connect to our Buddha nature. It helps us connect to

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.240
 the

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.200
 Buddha nature and others. It helps us bring out bodhicitta, joy, devotion, compassion, gratitude.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.120
 That's what's skillful. So what ways do we hold ourselves? Do we support ourselves? Sometimes do

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:39.040
 we limit ourselves so that we can more directly, more thoroughly, more just full on connect to this

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.840
 goodness within ourselves and the goodness around us and the goodness in others. So it's skillful

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.360
 if it helps us do that. So having accumulation, we're putting ourselves in a container of doing

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:56.720
 100,000 of each of these five sets. We're holding ourselves in this pattern so that we can connect

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.800
 to these goodness qualities in ourselves and others. And it's good. It's a practical thing

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:09.920
 that also what's skillful is to some degree that putting ourselves in the corner,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:17.360
 right, where we can't just go do what we want. We're going to sit down for an hour or two hours.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.040
 We're going to recite it in such and such way. And we're going to follow the linear sequence. And

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:30.960
 there's an order that we're holding ourselves to. That part of our egoic response to just want to

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.440
 break free and do what I want and my way and I don't want to do this and I have other things to do

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:44.560
 and I'm so busy. Expect that. Because that's the habit energy we have of trying to avoid actually

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.600
 doing what we know is good for us and connecting to our goodness and trusting that goodness in

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.560
 ourselves. Our egoic tendency is going to want to say no. This feels too hard. This feels too

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.240
 confusing. I'm falling asleep. I'm too bored. We'll fill in a kind of some example of why

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:10.080
 this isn't okay. And that's also skillful because we need to see how our mind and our heart shuts

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.200
 down and avoids trying to open up. We have to become conscious of that. That's a big part of

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.200
 the path of seeing how we keep avoiding doing what we know is really critically important

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.880
 for our own freedom, for our own happiness, so we can be more of benefit to others. We have to see

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.920
 how we keep not doing that with a kind, you know, with kindness, personal kindness. But that's also

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:40.490
 skillful if we feel like oh I have another reason I'm not going to do my nundra today. It's a skill

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.640
ful

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.880
 means of the nundra, helping us see that. It's also a skillful means of the nundra of connecting

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.320
 to that goodness, that diligence, these paramitas, and actually sitting down and doing it. So it's

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:00.800
 good and one way it holds us within our bodhicitta and it also shows us how we keep refusing to be

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.960
 in our bodhicitta. So it has this kind of dual effect and that wisdom of seeing where we're

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.280
 stopping ourselves, that's wisdom. And also that wisdom of seeing where we're really fully taking

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.440
 on the beautiful responsibility of our nature, like fully shining out, that's also wisdom.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.280
 Oh and I just remember too, I'll just say quickly, along the lines of talking about

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:40.080
 when we are doing our accumulations in nundra, someone had asked about, you know, if during the

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.840
 day you have some extra time to work on your accumulations and that's wonderful. And what

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.080
 Rinpoche's have instructed with that is definitely if we have the goal of going through the full

00:23:52.880 --> 00:24:00.480
 nundra practice at least once in a day or whatever you're setting as your goal, let's assume it's

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:08.560
 once a day. And then you go through from beginning to end of the practice text,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:18.640
 dedicate the merit, and somewhere in there you've spent more time with the section you're

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:25.040
 accumulating. And then you continue, dedicate the merit, and move into the day, hopefully keeping

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.560
 the atmosphere of the practice and the view with your conduct. And then if you have time in the day

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.790
 for a little more formal session, you can go right to the section you're accumulating. But with

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.040
 that

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:45.520
 too you want to keep in mind the three frames. So begin with joy, appreciation, bodhicitta,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.160
 purity view, devotion, maybe recite the seven line prayer at least. And then if you have time,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:58.240
 lineage prayer. And then you can go with the spirit of refuge and bodhicitta. And then you

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.560
 can go to the section you're accumulating and then meditate a little and then dedicate the merit.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:11.040
 So keep those three frames. But again, so that's if you are accumulating, you can do that.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:23.760
 Okay, so maybe we'll, we will, not maybe, we'll start our main practice now of doing the nundra.
