NOTE     "synopsis": "Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 9\nMay 2, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 The meditation status and post-meditation status.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.330
 These six paramata practices are more emphasized to the post-meditation, particularly these post-

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.000
three paramatas,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 such as generous paramatas and morality paramatas, patient paramatas.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 It's more focused, more targeted for the post-meditation practices.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Because we have three things, and our motivation is where we spend time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 In the post-meditation, we practice maybe three hours, three hours, four hours, in 24 hours.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 But rest 17 hours or 20 hours is post-meditation status, if we use terminology.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 So therefore, then this post-three paramata is more focused on the 17 or 20 hours practices,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 20 hours duration that we're trying to keep up that.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 And always, all paramata practices are with mindfulness, with joy, with appreciation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 With appreciation and as much as we can do. Those are generally then known as "accommodity merit."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 All those are "accommodity merit."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 At each time, even in the post-meditation, even in your busy time, even in the street or whatever,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 in the work places, if you do some good things, dedicated merit is.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Merit, really, even we can join our short prayers by this merit.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 May all of everyone is free from suffering, difficult troubles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 In our short prayers, in the Tibetan song, the "tamsi zupani", "tum na nipa, dana, pamze, jeganak,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.000
 balun tum."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.410
 Sipanthon, our first line of the dedicating prayer of the short, condensed our dedicating and us

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.000
 praying prayers.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So those are, we can do. That is excellent.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.970
 All others, some kind of prayer, I dedicate this merit for all living beings, for their joy and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.000
 peace, happiness,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 as our local shora, as menjushiri, as a Buddha, menjushiri, sorry, bodhisattva, Samandabhadra,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 they're doing dedications. I do that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Same way, those are the in the Buddha teaching mentioned.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 So we are imitating of such great bodhisattvas with their dedicating,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 where they perform the aspiration prayer, I do the same way.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Then it's really known as you're swinging on the wings of those great bodhisattvas.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 We are swinging with the wings of the great bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas.
