00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 We have meditation, Dzokhi meditation, Mahamudra meditation, or Dzalong, Tomo practice, without

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.000
 that condition,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.200
 according to it won't go to power. And we have that beautiful, those motivations, the joy and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.000
 appreciation of bodhichitta,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 with strong connection to the Buddha Dhamma Samye Ling, Guru Prahmana Sambha,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 that all the enlightenment are rushing towards us to activate our elitations. Thank goodness.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 So, thank you again. So, we really understand now. And in the short meditation, whatever we do,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Shavada, Vibhaishana, whatever, relax and be in joy.
