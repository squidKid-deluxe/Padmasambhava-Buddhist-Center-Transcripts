00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 And except these three themes, otherwise there is not the Vajrayana teaching Vajrayana.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:24.080
 And therefore this time, the time during the time of the Buddha Chaturmani's teaching era,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 that we are, we're all known as the human being, really eating endowments, or the freedom and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.880
 luckiness we call it, just human beings, that we are with freedom and luckiness is made up.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.280
 Not just only that we have this freedom and luckiness we call it just, but we are

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.720
 perfectly in the path of the Vajrayana, or the seven Vajrayana teachings.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 And therefore, this time, you could not be under the powers of the leadingness and in limited use.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.680
 And therefore, please this is the time to practice of the Siva Vajrayana.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:40.160
 In order to practice the Vajrayana teaching, we need four qualities of the Vajrayana teaching,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:52.800
 that are four ingredients we need. And we don't have these four ingredients or the qualities,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.480
 then we could be practicing the Samayana and again heading to the mall and the dip of samsara.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:34.240
 And the Buddhas of the past and present and the future eat teachings, so many teachings,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.680
 but no one could have taught the teachings that were rich in enlightenment without,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:51.440
 oh sorry, no one got enlightenment by using directly, regularly the negative emotions.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:01.520
 Or just without it, never said that you will get enlightenment, but by just using directly

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.600
 negative emotions as it is. Now, here is our Gubuchudyenness, therefore,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.560
 what are those four ingredients or four necessities or four qualities?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:30.640
 For example, oh not example, we will be practicing. Well, we are practicing

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:45.680
 and our three drawers, the body, speak mind, are instantly kind of like going to the only

00:03:45.680 --> 00:04:02.080
 habit patterns or regular our carrier, kind of carried by the regular our habit patterns.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.360
 When our three doors are carried by the regular old habit patterns, that moment

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.400
 instantly cut down with forcefully of the habit pattern so that we restore our

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.480
 realization or our practices, so that we could have the method or the instruction that we can

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.080
 instantly cut down the old habit pattern when we are losing control and then same time restore.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 Not taken in this act is the number that is first ingredient or necessities.
