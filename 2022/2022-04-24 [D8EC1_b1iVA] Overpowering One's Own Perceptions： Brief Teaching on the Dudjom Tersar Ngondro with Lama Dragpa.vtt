00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 Warm greetings, warm greetings. Thank you all. Thanks so much. So, as we've been instructed,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.400
 and as we try to practice all the time in our formal sessions, and also in post-meditation,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.320
 we've got to reconnect these three points always. Renunciation, Bodhichitta, and pure

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.040
 perception are the foundational points of Tibetan Buddhism, Vashriyana. So renunciation can bring

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.600
 up this surge of joy, and just kindness, and that refreshing gratitude can highlight certain

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:03.280
 things that we're grateful for, and really recognize how good we have it. So we do that

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.380
 joy and appreciation. And then secondly, Bodhichitta, the heart mind of enlightenment, we all want

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.800
 to be happy, and no one wants to suffer. It's just a universal human condition, quality.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.720
 So we kind of recognize that and extend our motivation. I'm doing this so that all beings

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.400
 can be relieved of suffering and the causes of suffering, so they can be happy and have

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.520
 the causes of happiness right now, and end up recognizing their own nature completely.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.660
 They'll be free forever. And then thirdly, pure perception. In our case, we're connecting

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.840
 to the lineage blessings that we didn't really discover these teachings for ourselves. I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.040
 didn't discover the four noble truths, and the five powers, and the ten boomies, and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.880
 all these things that have been handed to us. Then what a fortune we have. We connect

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.480
 with that. Wow, these amazing things we have at our disposal, and that reality works like

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.400
 this. And we have the power and the personal opportunity to kind of lean into our own goodness

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.440
 qualities and those of others, and have that be in the front to begin by seeing the goodness.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 So this is like a very sutra way of talking about pure perception, to begin with Buddha

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.320
 nature and then continue. So kind of activate this opening door into pure perception too.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.680
 So renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure perception. Kind of shine that on now.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:23.480
 Thank you. It's good to remember these three points. That's what we're always kind of,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.280
 that's where we're trying to begin, where we're kind of being, kind of continuing through,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.340
 and where we're trying to, kind of where this all leads to, is these three qualities. So

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.200
 just to remember that, when we sit down for a practice, or to read the Dharma, to reflect

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.000
 on the Dharma, we're just trying to actually more genuinely connect to these three points.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.320
 As the kind of maze of reality is so complex, and we ourselves are so complex within that,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.840
 ourselves as dream beings in a very big dream world, that having these kind of key points

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.320
 in our minds to come back to, because that's actually where the path leads, it's where

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.680
 the path begins, and just to kind of, amidst all the amazing variety, to kind of retouch

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.840
 that home base again and again. So specifically the topic of this kind of brief talk and opening,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.920
 it's a slight bit into this one doorway of many, the topic of this kind of reflection

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:35.400
 now is called overpowering our own perceptions. Overpowering our own perceptions. And then

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.600
 the subtitle is kind of like the essential, is something like the essential value of power

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:57.000
 in Vajrayana Buddhism. So, I kind of like going to the kind of little, the spots that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:08.840
 are a little, a little juicy, like power. So this is the topic today, power. And just

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:17.040
 today like, oh, how is this going to be power? Because it's out on a limb talking about power.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.920
 So I went on a ding, ding, ding, ding, the magic smartphone and just put in three words,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.600
 rikpa, wiki, power. What does the internet say to me, you know? And it came back with

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.200
 all these things, rikpa, wiki, power. So that's my search, that's my search field. And I got

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:50.320
 back my, of the 13,000 results in 0.33 seconds, 10 powers, five powers, four powers, six powers,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.160
 four bases of miraculous powers, Vidyadhara with power over life, four empowerments, compassionate

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.800
 energy, empowerment, five strengths. If we've been in the Dharma for a little bit, these

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.280
 are kind of core things. I mean, they're very core, all of these, five powers, 10 powers,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.040
 six powers, four bases, miraculous powers. So then I went, okay, what are the 10 powers?

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.960
 Because power, you know, it's kind of like someone degree, a little bit of a iffy or off-limits

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.380
 topic. And it's like, so curious in Buddhism, why is it so off-limits? Why has this become

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:39.320
 so off-limits? So off-limit? Because Buddhism is filled with power. These books, if we get

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.760
 to them, I can do keyword search in these books, they're just filled with a word power. There's

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.040
 so much power in Tibetan Buddhism, and there's so much power in the nature. I mean, really,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:04.280
 every single system dies without power, disintegrates. What's power? Vital energy, life force, chi,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:14.640
 like just that lung, the wind, the vitality, the clarity, the force, the power, right?

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.900
 I mean, it's so in Tibetan Buddhism, oftentimes they put these three wisdom, compassion, power,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.840
 these are the Buddha's teachings. The three lords in the outer tantras, wisdom is manjushri,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:39.520
 compassion is avala kiteshvara chenrinsig, power is vajrapani, Lord of Secrets. It's so

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.280
 essential in Buddhism, and I would say in the nature, in all natural systems, they have

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.680
 to have the vital force, the energy, any system, any person, any relationship. It has to have

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.400
 its own internal integrity, the energy which gives it its movement, its activity, its expression,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:10.360
 its command of how it can play in its arena, in its display. And Buddhism is just filled

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.200
 with power, the nature is filled with power. So I think really the question is not as,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.120
 it's interesting why is power so off limits to talk about? Because the nature is filled

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:30.140
 with it, and without it, the natural systems die. They disintegrate into subsystems that

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:37.800
 don't hold as much power, that are less complex, right? It goes down to lowest level energy,

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.440
 energy level, even at the subatomic particle level, that's how it functions. When the complexity

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:49.800
 can't go here, it breaks into its more fundamental lower energy parts. That's just kind of how

00:08:49.800 --> 00:09:01.120
 that happens. So power, overpowering one's own perceptions. And I've come to see in Sutra

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.720
 Mahayana and my very little teeny tiny pinhole view of anything about Buddha Dharma, which

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.920
 is so sadly pathetic, it's so small. To even be able to say these things now is really

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:21.280
 kind of sad, it shows it's really degenerate age. Really. I mean the one thing that's not

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.320
 degenerate about that is that these, I'm trying to just repeat teachings that I've heard the

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:33.680
 way the Buddha said, this is still intact. There's like a living vital life force energy

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.760
 that still goes all the way back to Gurumbiche and Buddhism community and we still have it.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:47.280
 It's still happening, it's still thriving, it's still alive. The power is still there.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.160
 So what I've come to see in Sutra Mahayana and a tiny little pinhole view is power is

00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:00.400
 really about alignment, aligning. Lineage is about getting in proper relationship with

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:09.560
 reality, proper relationship with myself, right mindfulness, right view, right conduct, right

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.720
 speech. This is about a proper fit with what's going on around me. I'm lining up with it

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:24.640
 in a way where I can be with it, right, have the power with, I can participate with it

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:31.920
 and not squash it, but also be receptive and let it do its thing, but within what I'm available

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:41.480
 for. So there's always this give and take, attuning. This is called skillful means. It's

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.320
 the really key for Sutra Mahayana, skillful means. If we're really trying to make the

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.600
 wish that vow, the natural kind of such a beautiful gigantic vow for all beings to be

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.280
 free of suffering. And I personally will be the one to help bring that about my thoughts,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.240
 my deeds, my actions. That's an amazing amount of power we need. So how am I going to have

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:15.880
 that power? Because the answer actually gets really simple. Be with the nature, tune into

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.260
 the nature. The power is already there. The natural systems already have their vitality.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:28.080
 It's a question of how much can I hold without breaking? How much can I hold without getting

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.420
 stuck, without boxing the nature, natural vitality and the energy according to my preferences,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:43.320
 my egoic clinging, my way? How willing is my view to flexibly engage with experience?

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.920
 How much of my own natural energetic display am I allowed to say, oh, this is happening?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:55.160
 Oh, this anger is happening and not just shut it off. Oh, there's like passions happening

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:01.600
 and not shut it off. And at the same time, not be ruled by it, but to let the nature

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.640
 move and to accommodate and let it do what it does to align with the nature and not try

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:16.680
 to make it my way to be with it and let it do what it does. Let it go. Because it's constantly

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:22.340
 correcting itself. Interdependence is constantly enhancing itself. I'm really kind of fixated

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.760
 on this word right now, auto enhancing. I really think that's what the great bodhisattvas

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.760
 do. They sensitively see the cause and effect dynamics in a system, whether that's in a

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.280
 room or with a person or in themselves, they see that system, all the subtle cause and

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:44.080
 effect happening. So subtle, so much more subtle than sentient awareness. And they see what's

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.800
 stuck and what's available to be like enhanced a little bit. What, like the readiness disposition

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.200
 and availability of the student, right? To receive a transmission blessing and empowerment,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.800
 right? It all comes down to the receptivity of the person, my own mind. And these bodhisattvas

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.880
 see it so clearly, these natural cause and effect dynamics, and they see where I'm available,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.400
 where I'm stuck and where I'm not available. And then they just like give a little more

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.520
 space, a little more loving energy, a little more kind attention, a little more kind of

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:23.240
 like frictional boost, a little more energy, a little more power in really specific spots

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:31.480
 like a surgeon. And then my own system can start to auto enhance itself. And then the

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.840
 power comes from me. And it's not some power bestowed on me. It's not some I have to go

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:49.400
 and like, you know, like beg for power. But then my own awareness can wake itself up.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:57.080
 And I need the support to actually be woken up because I haven't woken up yet. And it's

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.880
 been so long. I need that support. So then it becomes a really critical question with

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:13.000
 all the discussions on power. The real critical critical question comes around to discernment.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.600
 Proper tuning. Proper alignment. In my mind, in this relationship, in this community, in

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.360
 this context, at this time, wherever I'm holding my field of vision, whatever I'm considering

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.520
 my world right now, what is available to be auto enhanced? What needs to be boosted? And

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.200
 what can't? What's so stuck? It's not ready to be. It's not ready to open and have more

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:46.440
 wisdom energy come through. That's called discernment. Prajna. And that comes from within

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:54.280
 one's own mind. That's completely on my own power. I'm the one who has to see that. What's

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:02.160
 available in this situation now. And primarily, before I talk about power with and power over,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.720
 I have to find my own personal integrity first. Otherwise, it's all just fancy talk. And usually

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.760
 it's used to blame other people and not take personal responsibility. First, I have to

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.800
 connect with my own goodness. So if we're talking in Buddhist context with Sutra Mahayana Buddhism

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:30.280
 and Tantra Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha nature has to be there first, which is where we began.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.360
 We really have to connect with the goodness first. Goodness in others first, goodness

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.720
 in ourselves first. That's just a core foundational thing we cannot compromise. If we're really

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 going to try to be practitioners, we can't start with where someone else is wrong or

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:52.040
 where I'm wrong. It completely shuts off our connection to our own power, their own power,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.160
 and then how can we co create and make awesome, more powerful, more empowering things? We

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.240
 can't. We start off with what's wrong, what's missing, what's lacking, what's broken, outside,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:08.460
 inside. And then we try to build something on top of that and all we get is power over.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.280
 All we get is I feel something wrong inside and I'm going to try to make you fill in the

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:23.480
 gap. That's a really oppressive power. And so we get all these ways of oppressive power.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.700
 And so there's a history of oppressive power. And I think this is where a lot of the ify-ness

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:35.160
 of this conversation comes up. We've gotten so used to oppressive power that a lot of

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:43.840
 people and myself too have a habit of thinking all power is oppressive. But it's not true.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.840
 Every system needs power. It needs vitality, integrity, discernment, energy, life force.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.680
 It's not a question of power, yes power or no power. It's a question of what kind of

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.440
 power and is it tuned into the system right now? What's happening in this specific thing

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:10.680
 and primarily in my mind, in my heart? And Buddhism, like our gracious Noble Teacher

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:18.600
 Buddha, that's where he started. Be your own teacher. Even better than me being right next

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.500
 to you is for my own mind to have mindfulness to see what my mind is doing right now. That's

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.720
 the greatest teacher. The Buddha said that and Noble Nagarjuna repeated that and led

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.840
 her to a friend. And Kemposarang Rinpoche taught about this extensively in his "Shedra"

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.520
 on Letter to a Friend by Nagarjuna. Personal power has to start with my own responsibility

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:46.640
 to see what am I doing? What am I bringing to this? The Buddha was so clear on this.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.580
 And then Sutra Mahayana says, okay so we develop that mindfulness, conscientiousness, alertness.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:18:00.120
 We develop that personal clear seeing that auto enhances my speech and my activities

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.520
 because it brings more prajna and the more prajna brings more compassion and the compassion

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:13.720
 includes the system. It lets my natural vitality be there. And then the natural next move is

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:22.480
 to extend, to become a servant to the world. A servant of peace. That's the next natural

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:29.100
 extension of that. It's called bodhicitta. It's a bodhisattva style. I discover I have

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.880
 some internal worth, then I take responsibility for really like actually enhancing that and

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.320
 growing that and opening that and freshening that. My own power. And it naturally extends

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:49.560
 to, oh you have so much worth and power too, so what can I do to tune in to you and your

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.160
 terms, what works for you and your history and language and trauma and all the ways that

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:01.920
 we are habit situate my sense of self. I can tune in there as much as I can according to

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:12.960
 my skillfulness, my power. And then whatever is available, uplift and then let go because

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.560
 you have to keep your power. I can't do anything for you. Fundamentally you can't make my mind

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.400
 wake up. You can just make it a little easier to have my own mind have a teachable moment.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.680
 That's what an empowerment is. The teacher says, I'm doing this with my body, speech

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.480
 and mind. They say students, you do this with your body, speech and mind. And then we'll

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:40.560
 do these ritualized things. We'll create this kind of very synthesized, very harmonic scenario

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.920
 and we'll let the lineage blessings pour through it and let all the wisdom beings like totally

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:53.200
 mingle and merge with us here in the sacred space and have the mind see itself more clearly.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.120
 These are called the primary cause and condition which is my mind seeing itself and the secondary

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.400
 cause and condition, which is what all the empowerment dynamics are about. It's not some

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:09.120
 ritual hocus pocus. It's about connecting to the vital energy in the dynamics like the

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.820
 cause and effect way bigger than we ever usually do and much more subtle than we ever usually

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:21.560
 do. So all of a sudden all the juice of all this vast network of cause and effect is allowed

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:30.320
 to come into my being, my mind right now, like, like, you know, nectar being poured on my head.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.960
 And guru yoga, right? It's the same thing. Self empowerment in our own visualization practice,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.200
 self empowerment. And it's just so I can wake up. What? Not because something I didn't have

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.000
 came into me, but because my own power harmonized with itself more fully. It was less blocked.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.040
 My own Buddha nature was shining out more beautifully. And then I have the power to keep doing that

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.320
.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.160
 That's what Vajrayana is about. In empowerment, we got to try to see, oh, this happened. Oh,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.800
 there is, there is this type of nature that's fully open and compassionate, loving, kind.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.740
 It's so much power, so much energy. And we try to recognize that our own natural state

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.920
 of being. And then we try to reproduce that again and again, right now in real time, in

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.960
 this sadhana practice, in this moment, even without a sadhana practice, we're trying to

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.440
 ongoingly recognize that same natural state and use eventually we get so good, try to

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.760
 use everything as a secondary support to have that waking up, to have that energy kind of

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:47.680
 like shine on. And then it's not a question really in that context. So this is a very Dharma

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.520
 context. In that context, there's not a question of power over versus power with. It's much

00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.580
 more in my estimation, a question of healthy power over and healthy power with. Power over,

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:09.560
 what does it mean? Hierarchy. There's really toxic hierarchies and there's really liberative

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:16.140
 hierarchies. Toxic hierarchy. There's like so many crusades and genocides that have been

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.400
 done because of that. That is something to be, whatever we can do to avoid that, we should

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.960
 use our own prajna to avoid that and to stop that. Healthy hierarchies. Buddhism's filled

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:36.280
 with it. It's called nine yanas, ten boomies. I mean, any hierarchical system, it's just

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.880
 a growth hierarchy. You start at step one, then you move to step two, then step three,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.560
 your compassion starts like this, then it gets like this, then it's step three, step

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.280
 four. All the yanas, it's a total natural hierarchy system. If someone's on the tent

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:56.160
 boomy, they are definitely above someone on the first boomy. Right? They're power. They

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:03.800
 have much more power. So you can say they're much more finely attuned to the nature. So

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.480
 what happens with healthy power over? We, meaning whoever's involved in the conversation

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.680
 gets to decide, okay, what's the metric we're looking at here? Is it talking about boomies?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:20.320
 And what is boomy measuring? Bodhicitta. Okay, so we're going to talk about bodhicitta. Okay,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.080
 so how much is your bodhicitta on and how much is my bodhicitta on? Your bodhicitta

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:33.120
 is on! Tent boomy. My bodhicitta is nothing. Firefly in the sun. They have much more guidance

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.840
 and expert skillfulness on that metric than I do. So many beings. How do they use that

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:48.240
 power? A natural, healthy power over dynamic will help me recognize that in myself and

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.000
 it'll let me know these are the steps I can take to do the same thing and to realize the

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.680
 same degree of power that they have. The best teachers in Buddhism want all their students

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:07.640
 to surpass them. And they give the means to do it. This is a very healthy hierarchy. The

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:15.400
 best teachers. Really, and for we ourselves, a really realistic assessment, we are composed

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:23.240
 for the future. Straight up. I want to be the most nutritious compost as possible for who's

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.520
 coming after this upcoming generation. And this is like such a big project to free all

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:35.040
 beings from samsara. It's such a big view. So what can I do to harmonize my own internal

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:43.280
 power, my vitality, and to rely on expert guidance tuned into very specific metrics?

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.640
 The five power, the ten powers, right? The ten powers. Power over life. Power over mind.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.280
 Power over material things. Power over action. This is just straight up, Sutra mayana power.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.760
 It's all power over. Power over life. Over mind. Over material things. Power over action.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.280
 Power over birth. Power over aspirations. Power over prayer. Power over miracles. Power

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:13.200
 over wisdom. Power over dharma. And then there's Mipham Rinpoche's commentary. Rigpa Wiki,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.640
 ten powers. This is called healthy power over, healthy hierarchy. There's no question that

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:26.120
 there is such a thing. I think it's a degenerate idea that all hierarchy is fundamentally bad,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.760
 or that all power is fundamentally wrong. I think this is a very distorted perspective.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.860
 You can just keyword search in any Buddhist book the word power and you'll find the healthy

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:43.120
 version of the power. And then what is power with? Cooperative, participatory, it listens,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.880
 it learns, it receives, it corrects. Oh, I made this mistake. Oh, and you confess it.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.120
 I made this mistake. I want to not make this mistake again. I want to receive the blessings

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.320
 and the four powers of Vajrasattva. Like I'm going to activate those to actually remove

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.760
 that mistake from my stream of mind and not keep doing it. Not keep going down that same

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:14.160
 old path, the same drain, not leaking all my power. I want to have more integrity so

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:21.360
 I can help others more and serve better, tune into others better, power with. And then once

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.840
 that kind of attunement happens more skillfully than the arena of my capacity expands, I can

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:36.200
 serve more beings. I can chew into all the things they've been through so much more sensitively.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.160
 So it's not just saying some like, oh, the four of these and the 10 of this and all that.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.560
 It's not just frameworks that are totally reliable, but it's much more of a direct experience

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.320
 with what someone really needs to, like what's actually going on with them. And these really

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:55.080
 skillful realized beings like the Venerable Kemperemiches, they know right what it is.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.680
 So they don't have to take some big hour long thing. They just go right to the point. And

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.320
 it's what a blessing to be around beings like that. It just saves us so much time. This healthy

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.320
 power over. They tune into us and help us auto correct ourselves to discover our own

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:21.160
 power. What an amazing blessing. There's so much to say about power. It's a very big topic.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.800
 I'm going to very quickly go through, I just went through, open some of Rimeche's books

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.920
 today and looked up the word power. And then I put them into, here's my narrative. Chapter

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:41.040
 one, chapter two, chapter three. Okay. Chapter one. This is the current, the current May

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:47.190
 upcoming is like the next month calendar quote, PVC calendar quote, just one moment of

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.400
 understanding

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.600
 the nature of impermanence has tremendous power to soften and relax our mind, breaking

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:02.920
 down our ego clinging and grasping. Just one moment of tuning into impermanence has a tremendous

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.160
 power to soften and relax our mind, let our nature kind of shine on and break down all

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.840
 the ways we're preventing that with our ego clinging. And Rimeche's book, Ceaseless Echoes

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:22.700
 of the Great Silence, they're going over when the Heart Sutra was first taught by the, with

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.680
 the Buddha between Shari Putra and Chenrezig, Avalokiteshvara, and they said this, the perfect

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.960
 time. There's the five perfections, one of which is the perfect time. Perfect time. The

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:41.520
 perfect time is undisturbed by mind, emotions or environment. It's peacefulness allows the

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:51.040
 power of the teaching to manifest. The perfect time is undisturbed by mind emotions or environment.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:03.040
 Its peacefulness allows the power of the teaching to manifest. There's not enough time to like

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.400
 say a big thing about each of these. So there's, and they kind of speak for themselves. The

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.760
 Seven Nails by the Rimeche's, this is like their commentary on Sri Sinha's Seven Nails

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:20.680
 that he gave to his students. So Sri Sinha, this is on personal power. You have every

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:27.600
 authority and every power to change your future. Of course the future has not yet arrived but

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.720
 the present is here and it's like the wheel of a car. Wherever you like to turn in the

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.760
 future is in your hands right now. For this reason many great Zogchen practitioners have

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:45.880
 said the horse's reins are in your own hands. Wherever you'd like the horse to go, it is

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:59.600
 in your own hands and no one else's. This is called personal power from a Zogchen level.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.800
 So we have the power fundamentally and all the Buddha's teachings are based on that fact.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:11.840
 We have to keep our own power. So a side point is that a study is the insurance policy. If

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.740
 we actually find ourselves in an unhealthy power dynamic, then study or like what we've

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:24.240
 heard from the Buddha and our contemplation will give us, will cue us in to say, "Hey,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.720
 the Buddha didn't teach this. According to my study and these scriptures and all these

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.440
 teachings I've received and what I've reflected, the Buddha didn't teach that." And if you're

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.640
 with someone, like a teacher or a community, and they're unwilling to have the discussion

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:45.840
 about, "Oh, is this according to the Buddha's teachings or not?" If it's a Buddhist community,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.760
 they should be very up for that conversation because otherwise what else are they doing?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.080
 So for a student, you have to be able to check things. What's the role of a student? What's

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.280
 the quality of a teacher? What's the role of a teacher? What's the quality of a student?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.960
 We've received these teachings so many times from our teachers. Why? So we can check for

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.540
 ourselves. What's going on here in my mind in this relationship? What's expected? What's

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.680
 upcoming on the path? What are the pitfalls? How does the system maintain its integrity?

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:25.140
 This is called samayas, pratimosya vows, bodhisattva vows, the protections to maintain the internal

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:30.880
 integrity or power of a system to make my promise come true, my bodhisattva aspiration

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.680
 come true, my Vajrayana commitment come true. They give us all these guidelines so we can

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:43.480
 do it for ourselves. This is called really healthy power with and healthy power over.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.800
 So then uprooting, clinging, commentary on Mipham Rinpoche's wheel of analytic meditation.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.880
 So this is Sutra Mahayana, Mipham Rinpoche, largely on the five skandhas. These are all

00:31:53.880 --> 00:32:01.280
 Kemba Rinpoche's books. So this is on lessening the power of thinking. Uh-oh. So now it's

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:09.060
 talking about lessening power. It is important to exercise authority over what we call mind.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:15.780
 It needs a certain state of discipline, when what we think is not always true. In fact,

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.120
 our minds are often very deluded. We shouldn't give our thoughts full authority or power

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:26.340
 over us. Otherwise, we give too much power to thinking, which causes instability in our

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.360
 minds. In order for mindfulness to guide our thoughts in the right direction, observing

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.440
 our thoughts is all that we need to begin. To discipline the mind and put it on the right

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:44.640
 track, all that is required is here right now in our own mind itself. Loving kindness, compassion,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:54.020
 and wisdom are what lead it in the right direction and cultivate proper discipline.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.600
 So we have to be discerning again over what we're giving authority to even in ourselves.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.840
 Is this thought train like chain of delusion? Is it not empowering me or is it empowering

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:13.320
 me? We have to discriminate or discern. That's called mindfulness, right? Then this goes

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.860
 on to talk about the power of rigpa, not just the unhealthy, sometimes unhealthy power of

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:26.040
 neurotic mind, but the healthy power of wisdom awareness. Ego is the misconception that personality

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:32.680
 is everything. It's a kind of holding and grasping which, by its very nature, does not allow

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:40.440
 for freedom or openness. As a result, the nature of mind, rigpa, is not able to fully display

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:46.320
 all of its inherent qualities. The energy and power of the inner state is not fully

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:53.600
 revealed. Ego doesn't allow the original wisdom of non-conceptual wakefulness to radiate.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:59.360
 In addition, it doesn't allow us to see the illusory nature of attachment. Instead, ego

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:06.400
 clinging, which is what ego is, manifests in every single action, outer and inner, middle,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.260
 top and bottom, throughout the body and the mind. When ego clinging is loosened, there

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.980
 is a natural openness, freedom and relaxation that allows love and compassion to arise.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:24.000
 As attachment is removed, love and compassion radiate out very easily without effort. Since

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.380
 possessiveness and greed are a result of ego clinging, when ego clinging is absent, they

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:35.720
 naturally disappear, and instead they are replaced by non-attachment and generosity.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:41.320
 In fact, to go beyond clinging is to realize the true nature of emptiness, and to fully

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:49.720
 realize emptiness is to become an arhat or a bodhisattva. So that's what a healthy power

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:56.700
 is like when we don't kind of box it up and constrain it. Then in their book, there's

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:02.400
 a restricted book on Yeshe Lama called "The Supreme Wisdom." There's a section, page

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:09.880
 314, on the five powers. Then I jump to the fifth one, the power of wisdom.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:15.400
 The fifth and final power is the power of wisdom. As we've said before, wisdom means

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:24.040
 knowing something clearly, without deprecation, exaggeration, subtracting, adding, or labeling.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:31.420
 It knows everything as it is. This is the nature of rigpa. Rigpa is free from all complexities

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:38.620
 and all dualities. Rigpa is pure, unimpeded, and free from coming and going. It is free

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:46.960
 from existing, non-existing, neither and either. Rigpa is totally free, totally infinite, totally

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.000
 open, and totally empty. It embodies all of the kyas and all the wisdoms are completed

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.140
 within it without missing anything. Relaxing without making any effort and knowing everything

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:10.200
 clearly as it is, is known as wisdom. In Dzogchen, we are kindling the light of self-born wisdom.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.640
 Rigpa illuminates, clarifies, and brings brightness in every direction beyond all directions.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:24.200
 It goes beyond space, time, and every other conception. That is the power of wisdom. In

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.480
 order to keep our practice moving forward, it is very important to have these five powers

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:36.280
 all the time. They make our practice more directed and bring us closer to our goal, which is

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.160
 why the Buddha called them powers. When you have power, you have abilities. We should

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.800
 always apply these five powers in both meditation and post-meditation. And they are the powers

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.600
 of devotion, joyful effort, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. And there is a pema mandala

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:56.800
 that

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:06.680
 goes over the five powers, extensively by the Kambhirmachis. So that is what the power

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:18.520
 of Rigpa is like. Then in their book, Vajra Sound of Peace, Practicing Seven Chapter Prayer

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:28.920
 of Guru Padmasambhava. This was Kenshin Bhallan Sheribhirmachai's last teaching here in 2010.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:40.000
 He taught for a month on this text, page 41. "The Dharmakaya Lama, the nature of the mind,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 is not a negation state. It is not nihilistic, blank, or empty. As it says in the text, it

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.720
 is filled with great compassion and great wisdom power. This is the clarity aspect of

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:59.880
 the mind, which Guru Padmasambhava calls the pure land of spontaneous great bliss. Altogether,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.400
 the inherent qualities of compassion, wisdom, and clarity are the pure land of great blissfulness.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:12.520
 Many forms emanate from this pure land, but there are five principal ones, form, sound,

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:19.200
 mind, qualities, and actions. These are known as the five wisdoms, and also as the five

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.320
 Dhyana Buddhas. They are the Sambhogakaya, the mind's active expression of compassion,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:38.560
 wisdom, and clarity." So the clarity aspect of mind is the power of the mind. So the whole

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:45.680
 point here is if we give out a power as if power is all bad, we lose everything. It's

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:53.880
 like a floppy ragdoll. But what we have to keep having is discernment, tuning. We have

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.160
 to tune in. And what am I ready for? Is this working or not? And that's our own personal

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.240
 intelligence. Our own wisdom is required. That's where the path doesn't become just some kind

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.560
 of theistic. It's not theistic, because Buddhism is not theistic. We're actually trying to

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.840
 recognize from within, but while relying on supports outside, so that we can better serve

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:23.800
 everyone outside. So we find internal freedom so we can better serve other beings. This

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:34.120
 is also the union of republicanism and democraticism. Internal freedom so that we can best serve

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:43.440
 everyone else. There's a real fine point there. Internal power so we can have power with in

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:52.200
 a more extensive way. So that's just one side point. Okay, so this I'm almost done. The

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:59.560
 Rinpoche's Anu Yoga book, the Shirdra they gave for a month on Anu Yoga Yana, the whole

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:09.280
 Yana, the eighth Yana, called the key to opening the wisdom door of Anu Yoga. On page 2, page

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:20.520
 2, they go over this. The three inner tantras will rule over or empower everything. In other

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.080
 words, this Yana will completely reveal the nature or the purity of the way things are

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:34.240
 without holding anything back. But what exactly do we mean by rule over or empower? The Tibetan

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:43.080
 expression is wangjir. Wang is power and jir is turning, ruling over, ruling out, or power

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:50.400
 of method, skills, or secret. So what does ruling over or ruling out mean here? It means

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.640
 this teaching will rule over or rule out duality mind, ordinary mind, or regular duality

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.080
 conceptions.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:05.360
 And from where or to where will it rule them out? It will rule them out in the purity state

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.420
 the way the nature already is. Thus the inner tantras rule out regular ordinary duality

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:17.800
 conceptions and usher us into the purity status known as the purity state of wisdom and the

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:31.560
 kayas or the purity state of wisdom and forms. So this is where we're subduing our own neurotic

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.900
 states of mind and grasping. This is healthy power. This is actually the whole path of

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:45.000
 Buddhism is what we have to do. Then in their liberating duality with wisdom display book,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.800
 the eight emanations of Guru Rinpoche on page three, Venerable Camperomache say Guru Padmasambhava

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.880
 is associated with transforming negative energy into more peaceful and compassionate forms

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:06.080
 and with developing power and a heart of loving kindness and compassion. So Guru Rinpoche

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.720
 is associated with transforming negative energy into more peaceful and compassionate forms

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:20.640
 and with developing power and a heart of loving kindness and compassion. Wisdom, compassion

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:28.960
 and power. And this is the last one I'll do. There's one more. An essential journey. All

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.600
 of Rinpoche's books, they all go over the power so extensively and the tantras are just

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.920
 filled with power. And like there's many ways that they unpack this and many levels of the

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.640
 meaning of power. And if we use our own discernment, then this becomes something that we can really

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:51.140
 like have it really auto enhance our own path and not waste so much time. I mean, honestly,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:57.040
 like for myself too. So the last thing is this Zogchen view, which Rinpoche's have taught

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.360
 about quite a lot. And they're like Zogchen view is often taught about in these three

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:09.280
 ways, the essence, the nature and the compassionate energy or power. And this is we're about to

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.800
 say a prayer by His Holiness, Guru Rinpoche, about these three kayas. Dharmakaya is the

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:21.720
 essence and the nature is the sambhoga kaya and the compassionate energy is the namanakaya

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:28.840
 display, the power. And here with these three, the power or this compassionate energy, which

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:35.160
 is called tukche, then it says it has three qualities. And this is all very traditional,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:42.160
 the quality of being unconfined, unobstructed and all pervasive. So that's the natural radiating

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:50.200
 power of reality. And of our own mind, we're a part of that dream. And then they say those

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:56.960
 same compassionate energy, the arising display of mind of the wisdom mind has three wonderful

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:05.600
 qualities. Then one is the wisdom that knows, so it discerns accurately as five wisdoms.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.780
 The compassion that is loving and caring. It includes it embraces everything. Nothing's

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:17.380
 left out. There's no favorites and there's no preferences. And then three, the power

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:23.380
 that is able to liberate, protect and benefit beings and fulfill the enlightened activity

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:29.080
 of the Buddhas. This is the power of this compassionate energy to liberate, protect

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:37.640
 and benefit beings and fulfill the enlightened activity of the Buddhas. So this is like the

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.400
 nature of mind. I mean, this is what this teaching is about. And without, if we don't

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.760
 let that power be there in the nature of the mind, then we're not working with the nature

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.840
 of the mind. And if we don't let the power be there, like this kind of healthy discerning

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:58.880
 power, then we can't do anything on the path. We like need that vital force. And then to

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:07.440
 bring it all to a point when we're dying and all, we can't rely on any external anything.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.040
 Because all our ways of cognizing and making sense of things and referring to things, the

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:16.960
 sounds and smells and tastes and forms and memories, it's all going to go out of our

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:25.440
 control. At that moment, we'll see how much personal power we have. Did we take all our

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.480
 power and put it outside? Blame someone else? Or did we really actually activate our own

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:40.760
 intelligence? What is there unaffected by whatever happens? And that's going to be a

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.900
 very practical question. It's not even a question at that point. It's just going to be an

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.660
 experience

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.800
 we have and we'll see for ourselves how much did I really actually take my own personal

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:58.080
 power seriously? And we'll see. And I really hope we all see and then we all get free because

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.800
 we really did now take that question genuinely seriously to cultivate that connectedness

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:10.760
 to others, that really genuine bodhisattva outreach to want to care for them and uplift

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:17.860
 them and serve them and be with them and tune into them. And then discernment, the discernment

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:23.920
 that, okay, so I am affected by reality and by others because I'm a conditioned being

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:32.440
 and this is a conditioned mind. So to wisely be affected, to wisely receive guidance and

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:40.620
 to wisely discern what's not helpful and just put it aside. So to wisely be affected by

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:45.420
 experience that's called education. Everything is like a teachable moment and everything

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.720
 actually can be empowering. These are the higher level tantra teachings. Everything

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:56.020
 can be seen as the guru at that level if we're really going to use discernment. And then

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:03.040
 similarly at the same time we're wisely being affected, being changed, being influenced,

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:09.920
 being opened, being softened. At the same time we're trying to see what cannot be affected.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:18.280
 The deathless nature. What in me is not a question of whatever happens with that power

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:24.160
 over or power under or power with or good or bad or right or wrong or healthy or unhealthy.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.020
 Toxic or natural, it's nothing to do with that. It's just a great equality which is

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:35.960
 where all these practices are rooted in. And the final point in guru yoga, yes, the guru

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:43.760
 Rinpoche is above. And where did guru Rinpoche come from? Within. And what's the nature of

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.440
 guru Rinpoche? The same as my nature. And guru Rinpoche is realized so much more of that

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:55.040
 nature than me. He's way beyond, way beyond little old me and my small mindedness. So he

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.400
 has power over and it's healthy and he's from within me because it's my display. So that's

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.960
 power with. And our nature is the same. That's the great equality. And it's totally pure.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:12.140
 He's completely beyond all dualistic fixation. That's a great purity. And at the end his

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:17.120
 mind mingles into my mind out of his so much compassion and we become inseparable and the

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:24.320
 same. And then everything is just a display of reality and let its power do what it does

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:36.880
 naturally. So thank you. I appreciate you all very much. I wanted to open this door because

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.920
 it's a door already opened, but maybe it's not done with so much love. And I wanted to

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.760
 also say this is really relevant to Buddha Dharma. So we have to discern the what's this

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.840
 really healthy power. It's because this is really talks about this is really comes down

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:57.680
 to the integrity of the lineage. If we don't really clearly discern how the lineage is

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.120
 really relating to this, these kind of questions, these kind of inquiries and to really have

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:11.800
 that inquiry be alive in ours in our minds with really clear empowered discernment. Then

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:21.000
 it's a very chaotic world. Now we can lose all kinds of amazing things. So really I'm

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:29.040
 very strong about this. Not on my watch. I'm not going to be the one to lose the integrity

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.040
 of the lineage teachings, even though I'm just like a speck of nothing. Like at the

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:41.440
 very least we can do the way we've received it and we can really try to like allow for

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.980
 the blessings of the lineage to enter us and to change us and to do that with a lot of

00:49:46.980 --> 00:50:13.860
 internal integrity and like personal power. And that's what the Buddha has us to do. So

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:21.840
 I think it's important for me to say that in terms of me talking about power, anything,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:28.680
 that I really genuinely like I see in a lot of ways like I'm very much coming from a place

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:37.920
 of advantage or privilege. So I'm definitely a white male hetero normative cisgender middle

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:46.700
 age person in United States of America right now. And that's so it's kind of very questionable

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:53.040
 for me to be talking about a topic like power. So I really see that and at the same time

00:50:53.040 --> 00:51:00.160
 I'm genuinely like this is such an important topic to really have an inquiry around. And

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.340
 I know a lot of people don't have the advantage I have and in particular of really being able

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:13.480
 to be in the company and to learn at the feet of extraordinary realized beings like the

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:20.620
 Venerable Kemper which is that is just an unimaginable privilege or an advantage. And

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:26.020
 I've had that very special unique opportunity and still enjoy it and I'm so glad that I

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:34.720
 do. But for people who haven't had that and who have really been hurt like really hurt

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:42.340
 intentionally hurt by unhealthy toxic power dynamics like I'm so sorry that that's a part

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:49.040
 of your experience now and that that's I'm really genuinely like deeply that's like deeply

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:58.420
 troubling for me. And so still like how can we hold that that space like this inquiry

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:04.100
 around like our own internal kind of energy and power and vitality like how can we reconnect

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:11.200
 to that and like really kindly and clearly put ourselves in the company of others and

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:18.720
 of supportive conditions that help us like reestablish trust and reestablish connection

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:25.800
 to the goodness and others as well as ourselves and then step by step to undergo that process

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:33.120
 of like personal exploration and also personal freedom like the path of enlightenment. So

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.000
 I see that that's definitely a slow process regardless of where we're coming like how

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.020
 wherever we enter that path it's going to be an exceptionally demanding path. And I

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:51.000
 think for most of us in this very like supercharged powerful frightening charnel ground which

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.940
 is the twenty first century we all need to proceed very carefully and gently and like

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:06.280
 with a lot of self-conscious kindness and intelligence to see what tunes with us and

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:11.800
 what doesn't and to really take responsibility as much as we can for that too and to surround

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.600
 ourselves with the nutritious conditions that help us really get into those stuck spots

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:22.760
 we have and open them and give them more renewed vital energy so we can continue to expand

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.560
 and grow and soften and and keep going on a path of enlightenment for ourselves and

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:34.640
 all beings that's a slow and very involved process for any of us and so I just I wanted

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:42.200
 to really clearly say that and then to be in a lineage structure if you have that opportunity

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.840
 I mean there's many of them and there's many different world religious traditions that

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.880
 have them and then the structure itself is also different from the people who are in

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:57.700
 the structure so we really do have to use all of these capacities we have and let those

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:04.560
 come out and fully inform how we engage step by step with our path so I hope you find those

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.240
 supports for yourself I'm trying to actively stay tuned into the ones that I found for

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:15.560
 myself and like all together really to like bring out that vitality of the nature so that

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.960
 we can all like be refreshed and enjoy it together it was like one really big family

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.000
 like in this together so thank you friends thank you thank you
