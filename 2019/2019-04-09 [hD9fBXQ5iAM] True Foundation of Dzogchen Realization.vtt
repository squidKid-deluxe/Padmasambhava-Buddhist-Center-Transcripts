00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 Thank you for participating, and I know this is so many difficulties and heart shares, so many

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.200
 schedules,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.470
 so your responsibility, you have to put a tremendous amount of effort in trying to put those on the

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.800
 sides

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.200
 and making time and coming there to be going to agree with this practice.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm so grateful and thankful for all your courage and commitment and pleasure,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.600
 in making these times. Thank you. Now, we should again begin to do practices.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.500
 We already started to do this, but again we should be standing up for the moral motivation of Dzogc

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.600
hen.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 And this is again so important. Every time the teaching says, you know, all the masters say,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 "Every session you should have Dzogchen appreciation."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 Break his attitude. It's really true. It's not just making up these things and trying to kind of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.600
 pull our mind,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 trying to come back. This is true, we make. It's all breaking, so important, so beautiful.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 And we're touching to our own goal of true nature, what we do, we inherit it.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 It's something that we remind our people and face happiness for ourselves.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 And also doing the same thing to others, we're trying to do that.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 And that is, again, there's nothing more beautiful, more spiritual than that.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 And particularly in Islam, we are connecting it to our deep goal of, you know,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 the nature of the visitors, the Dzogchen teaching for Dzogchen practice.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 Dzogchen is because Dzogchen teaching, when we talk about this teaching, is loosely outside.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 The reality of Dzogchen is within our mind. This is our nature of the mind.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 Dzogchen is not something that we are new, ideal, new systems that we are providing,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 trying to cooperate with our attitude and mind and try to put that.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 That is, it's not. The reality level is our nature. We're connecting.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 This is true nature of the mind or our old nature of Dzogchen.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 Dzogchen is really Dzogchen. Dzogchen is another. That is old man Dzogchen.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 These texts and the books and the teachings are the method or the passage to discover that.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 Why we need that? Because of due to our ignorance or duality that we spoil ourselves.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 And they just stand upon our realities so long, so many lifetimes.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 By the kindness of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni and all those great masters,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 reconnected us to that nature, the world of our nature. So that is what the religion is.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 I mean that of course we all know. We all know how some do.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 But therefore, long after our training, we reconnect with you at this time.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 And therefore, really, full joy in the applications of happiness.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 It's just so very beautiful. And that is the beginning of our practice.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 This is our beginning of also enlightenment and discovery of nature.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 You will never see it. Then the Buddha teaches you always in this life.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 Precious human body, precious life, the eating endowments.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 And we take out all those casual, basic things.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 But we really take carefully these eating endowments.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 Even this population is growing. There are billions of beings and billions of beings,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 for the human beings in this earth, for how many people have the eating endowments,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 these whole things.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 I mean let's say no one is in hell, and no one is in an animal realm,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 younger gods around, long black car, and all that.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 But that end of the, at freedoms, what is it?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 The wrong anti or wrong beliefs.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 Among that, at freedoms.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 At freedoms. The last one, even everything is perfect.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 We have that one, the last one of that freedom, without complete freedom.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600
 I mean those who are over there. They are not freedom.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 They are called by delusions and emotions.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 They are not free. But we are not.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 We are in that complete freedom status.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 100% freedom status.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 Then there is both luxuries, endowments.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.600
 Five luxuries, five luxuries, five luxuries connected to ourselves,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 five luxuries connected to others. You all know this.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 But again, if you look carefully, one after another, reflect like that.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 Last two, two, how many people have that luxuries?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 One is post-luxuries, they do this, they do this.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 And Buddha's teaching, Buddha came, Buddha remained,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 and there is manufactured humans.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600
 But if we are not connected with the teacher,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.600
 even if everything is there, then we are not luxuries

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.600
 for those who are not connected to the qualified teachers.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600
 And also not internally down now.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 Whatever our intentions, when we don't have five luxuries,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 or they are connected externally or coming out, we don't know.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 But we are not. We all have that five luxuries.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 Perfect! Truly we have 100% that.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 And then the five luxuries are connected to our own sadhva,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 being born as human, being married with one thing,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 and all the organs are intact, and all that one happens.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 The last one, the five luxuries, devoted to the teachings,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.600
 and we don't have that. This is not five luxuries.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 Again, we are missing. For those who are not that,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 even they are born in everything, perfect, contagious, completely.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 They are not freedom and endowments, they don't have.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 And we have that. We all have that 18 endowments,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600
 exactly that 18 luxuries are the premium,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 and 10 luxuries are perfectly intact.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 This is not just a co-accidenta, co-accidentia.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.600
 Truly it has beautiful cause and conditions.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 That even maybe we don't know exactly.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 Truly, there takes nothing to happen by accident, dentally.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 Truly it has cause and conditions.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600
 In the close and far distance and far distance.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 Even maybe we can't imagine this, that can be caused.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.600
 But there is that. Truly.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 We are omniscient, we know parts of the person in the future,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 and clearly every environment, clearly precise as the Buddha sees,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 or the enlightenment sees.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 Truly there is so many wonders to discover beautiful things.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.600
 So therefore, I mean, every aspect, really we are good.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 And the love is a world of writers.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 Even we have all that 18 luxuries.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
 Yet, we are quite well, quite stable.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 Quite stable, and moving forward with beautiful goal and hand,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 and keeping up our identity in a good goal at us,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 as much as we can, and always re-stainting,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600
 and re-correcting, and moving forward.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 This is all wonderful, beautiful.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
 So therefore, premium, joy, and everything.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 There you are, again, is the object teachings.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.600
 It's the lineage teachings, the object teachings.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 All those great masters, the real life stories,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 which we call Baba Rungo,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 are the first great chins, the first kundra.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 Even they are, like always in the teachings,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600
 in the life stories, the great masters,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 they are the emanated beings,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600
 from the great beings, who are really enlightened.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 But yet, if we read the life stories,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 their courage, their commitment, their joyful effort,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 their aspirations, their humbleness, humility,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 the haunted earth, it's just amazing.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 Really amazing, beautiful.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.600
 Those are our examples, role models.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 Truly they went through that, and we do that,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 and we're able to follow even that 20%, 50%,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600
 40%, and we're able to follow with that.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 We're doing quite good, really doing quite good.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600
 We can be happy, we can be good.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 Even we cannot do exactly what they did,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 like 100%, 190%, 70%, but even 40, 50, 60.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 It's great, great.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.600
 This is what all of this is.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 We do it all.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 Then again, with great joy and appreciation,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.600
 then help with, again, bodhijada.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 And then essence, bodhijada is essence of the old teaching.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 Bodhijada is zo-chin.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 Zo-chin is bodhijada.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 Danmar says so many great masters,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 great kindri bodhijada, many times mentioned.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 Bodhijada is really zo-chin.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600
 Bodhijada has generally two bodhijada.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.600
 And as you know, relative to the bodhijada,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.600
 absolute to the bodhijada.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 Absolute truth is bodhijada.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 That is zo-chin.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 And relative to bodhijada is a reflection of,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 or a display of the absolute bodhijada.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.600
 Therefore, really brilliant bodhijada attitude.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 For all living beings, we do that.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 Again, it makes our realization deeply growing,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 performing, we will grow with that.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 It's not just that we are doing this because we like to help others,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600
 but it's for us too.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 For that reason, the greatest teacher,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 Pradashaktamani said,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 "Properling the two goals."

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.600
 One's own goal, goals for others to benefit.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.600
 Bodhijada is the one to fuck two goals.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.600
 So, no, no, almost a kind of garden of bodhijada,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 even for ten minutes or five minutes.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.600
 Or two minutes, even one minute, we do that.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 Definitely, that's so powerful, so special.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 Then in the zokki teaching, that is the zokki teaching,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600
 and the highest of the teachings,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.600
 but I never give what there is ever in it.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 According to the teaching, this is the ultimate,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600
 and this is what it is.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 And this teaching is, again, in the reality level,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600
 because in the zokki teaching, everything is enlightened status.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 Even though we didn't recognize, we didn't discover that,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600
 the reality is all enlightened.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 What kind of enlightenment?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600
 The three kaya status.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 Tarmakaya, Sambokaya, Namakaya status.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 Our mind is in that state.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.600
 The nature of our mind is in that state.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 Environment is in that state.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.600
 There's nothing, divisions, no difference at all.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 All is enlightened.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 Even we don't have that realization right now,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 but at least opening that role,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 kind of motivating ourselves, can receive all is enlightened status.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 Tarmakaya, Sambokaya, Namakaya purity status.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600
 Status.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 And that means, also, each of us, individual,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
 all are displayed on the three kaya, the important states.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 Every and each of us are status.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.600
 So that is what, commonly known as in the reality level teaching,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 pure perceptions, for purity and sadness.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 Kind of bring that pull.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.600
 We're not kind of caught up with the duality mind,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 with the skeptical and hesitate and doubt.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 And that will be a long time, important teaching.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 Since the beginning of this time,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600
 we've been that state, that dark corner, all the time,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 the icy cold corners.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 And this is the time, we should change that environment.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 Bring up the brightness, the Chinese status of that,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.600
 so that we can see everything as shiny and beautiful,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 as glowing as it is.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 That is what we need.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 And with those who are more awakened,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 if you all know this is nothing that I'm talking,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 if you don't know that I'm just reminding,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 again I'm sitting right in front of you,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.600
 I should say something, so I'm going to say these things.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 Reminding, and in a way reminding to me, reminding to you,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.600
 and so that's what we need to practice.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.120
 And now, with this, and we go to the Zoki teaching.
