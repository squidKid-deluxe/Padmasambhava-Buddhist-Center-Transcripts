00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 Thank you again everyone. Thank you everyone for participating. Thank you for coming. Thank you

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.000
 again. Thank you Dr. Delos. Good morning Dr. Delos. Everyone, thank you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.570
 Again, we continue to go through the teachings of the great master, visionary, Tethu, Dudjo-Lungpa

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.780
's teachings, Sharp Vajra Awareness, all in a very shiit-like, dhol-jai-nombu. We continue doing

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.000
 that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.850
 And to begin the teaching, again, we could always restenstiny, regrouping our motivations to the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.000
 one-pointed mind state. That is joy and appreciation, a greater force.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.090
 And I mentioned many times to you, I mean you all know really, we have to be, have joy, joy and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.000
 effort. That is very foundational. And call it, in the central corner of the enlightenment Buddha.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Buddha. Buddha who?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.350
 When we like to get enlightened, or we like to discover our own true nature, we begin that right

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.000
 now with joy and appreciation, grateful and graceful, gratitude.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.060
 All those beautiful words, not just a leaf that on the shelf or somewhere, activate that to our

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.000
 heart. That itself is really practices. It is essence practices.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Dokki meditation, for example, we do Dokki meditation without joy and appreciation, being grateful.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 We won't go far. That's really.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 We received the teachings so many years ago. And we also practiced a little bit, but we are missing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000
 some ingredients.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.220
 What is it? That is joy and appreciation, gratitude, and the bodhicata, and the devotions, or

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 closing the connects to the lineage.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 All those are so powerful ingredients. They are simple, simple that everybody knows that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 But if you apply that to the heart and the mind, then really the wonders of the beauty will show up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 with ourself. We will see differences there.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 So therefore, joy and appreciation, and thankful, grateful to Buddha Dharma Sangha. And not just

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 only that, thank for yourself.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.750
 To all the situations and circumstances you have in samsara level too. We have one of the best sams

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.000
ara level situations and circumstances in these countries.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Really that. And so thankful, grateful.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.240
 Grateful, thankful is not that we are going to have to spend a lot of money or become something

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.000
 rich, have to do that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.120
 That is basic richness of ourself. Everyone has that. But because we are not exploring, that is all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.000
 poor mentalities and power ages.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 And then become kind of poorer and poorer, poorer and then won't drill up anything.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.580
 And therefore, really the joy and appreciation, grateful, thankful, all those so many ways, I mean

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.000
 you know that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.930
 Actually that, with that, what great, I mean Buddha, gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said, one

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.000
 in his teachings, known as dhodopa, in that way.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Dhodopa, in the English, is called, the samsara is called, the satayangata.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And he condense the meaning of the entire Pandya Paramada teaching.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 The entire Pandya Paramada teaching, what that means?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.910
 One thousand standard teaching, he condense it in one short poem in the teachings, or his story

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.000
 says it has 300 verses, 300 verses.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.780
 One hundred thousand standard teaching, condense it in three hundred standard teaching, Buddha

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.000
 directly spoke with all the dialogues.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Many times in the Buddha teaching has a lot of dialogues back and forth.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.850
 Because the Buddha like to give the opportunity to explore, to reveal that everyone's Buddha nature

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.000
, there was some shining Buddha, or there's so many dialogues.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 But this teaching is one of the way, renowned and permanent teaching, straightforward.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.690
 Said when Buddha saw the perfect situation, opportunity in the world just with motives, he locally,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.000
 kind of very gracefully, to all the poor groups of the audience.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.030
 And those are, Apasaka male and female, and Shavasaka male and female, and Bodhisattva male and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.000
 female, and the lay practitioners.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Those are poor groups. He looked and he, then he spoke directly.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 In that teaching at the beginning time, what is it?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Joy. Joy, respect and devotion keep close to the heart.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Then, well, glorified obscurations, or the stains, and, of obscurations, and then glorified stains.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Stains. So that is what that means.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.640
 When you were just practicing, meditating, when you were reflecting the teachings, we should always

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.000
 have the joy, as I said.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.570
 In the teaching, all the teachings said, joy and appreciation to the teaching, to the practicing,

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.000
 to ourself.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Also, then, said, devotions. Devotions to the lineage.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 This is the wisdom lineage teaching. It's not as all can be discovered all night, night by song.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.280
 Really, we are connected to the truly wisdom lineage of our love, love and compassion, that uninter

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.000
rupted from the time that Buddha gave the gracious teacher, Buddha gave the teaching, until now.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Really, that joy, appreciation, devotions.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.710
 And then, of course, we heard so many times in the practicing lineage, we know that devotion,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.000
 realization, won't shine.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.460
 Later Master Sara, I said, in the teaching, when you don't have the devotions, it really looks like

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:49.000
 you like to get sunlight in one cave, C-A-V-E, cave,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 which is passing north, and like to get sunshine. And how you can get sunshine in that?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.080
 And though the devotion, if you like to have that realization, if we just like ourselves, kidding

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.000
 ourselves, we must really pulling ourselves up.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.020
 When you have the devotion, that means our skeptical thoughts are gone. Our doubt and hesitation

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.000
 are gone.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 The respect and appreciation are coming. And then, we are strongly connected to the teaching.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.190
 You feel the preciousness, preciousness of time, our situation, our body, and the teaching, all

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.000
 really feel the preciousness.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Otherwise, it's just a casual or something, all that is casual, casual.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 We've been doing, thinking of neglecting that casual thought and missing so many points.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.380
 Truly, really, think of ourself, ourself. Therefore, please stand. If we would like to develop

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.000
 something to the heart and the mind,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.480
 and we'd like to lead that richness with this world, we have to have those joy and the devotees,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.000
 appreciation.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.850
 And then, respect. Oh, sorry. Then, we've got to mix it up a little bit, but what my brother said

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.000
 in the tibet,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:21.010
 God name, Kudai, Tevah. Goa, Kupa, Tevah. Goa means joy. Kupa means respect, respect, appreciation

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.000
 to the lineage,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 and tevah means devotion or the pain, f-a-i-t-h, pain to the teaching.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 That means you have courage and commitment. I'm going to practice. Unshakable pain.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.260
 And if the stock were paid, not just the paid of the surface, on the deck, from the deep of our

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.000
 heart, from the goal of our own bones,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.220
 develop the pain or the devotion. Devotion is more richness. Pain is just a strong courage and

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.000
 commitment,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.750
 a pain for more operations. With ourself, would that mean we're surrendering our ego to our own

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.000
 true nature?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Our true nature. Ego is completely, kind of like, from Tefan, so many times, us.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So, when we have the devotion, the pain, strongly with the devotion, with that, really, we are

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 going to,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.070
 we are going to defeat the ego, Kalimah. We are going to win a side, a winner side. We are going to

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.000
 win that.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 So, we want all those we were taught in the applications. Then, worry about this, obscurations.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 It will also remove the obscurations. And I will tell those maybe later, next time.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 But I want, there is six, five obscurations in the teaching method.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Five obscurations are really the obstacle for us. There's always a day of waiting, waiting.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And what the great master Nagarjuna said, there are these five obstacles are the rovers.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Robers of the spiritual realization, they rob us. They will rob. They're waiting after the rovers.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 They say, "Banditos," or the gangsters. They will rob our spiritual richness colleges.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Maybe I will just try to listen to that. First is, "Why mind?"

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Why mind? "Guten," "Yuten," and then regret. Second is regret.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 "Guten," I mean, "Guten," one mind, and then "Yoba," as I think one, one in a regret.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So, one, "Guten," "Yuten," "Nosin," and "Violence taught," is second.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Third is "Guten," "Yuten," "Nosin," "Mukbat," and "Dileness taught."

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Together with the "Sleepy taught" and the "Dileness taught."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 As combined together, again, so three. So that means, "Wild taught," "Recolored taught," are one.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And "Violence taught" are second. And third one is, "Pogi taught" and "Sleepy taught," are third.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And "Guten," "Nulandama," and always, and then fourth one, "Craving sensual pleasure objects."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 "Craving," "Craving sensual pleasure objects." That means "pipe sensual pleasure objects."

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 "Poem," "Song," "Smell," "Taste," "Touch," "Touch," or "Mental State."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:12:00.780
 Six, then six becomes six, "Guten," "Guten," "Nosin," "Mukbat," and again, maybe, "Guten," "Nosin,"

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.000
 "Mukbat," and "Dulandama."

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 And the fifth one is, "Doubt," "Doubt." The fifth one is, "Doubt."

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.200
 These five are the big robbers to rob our spiritual realization, or spiritual foundations, or

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.000
 Dharma practices.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.580
 They're waiting, and they're really waiting, kind of. They're like, "I've told you maybe this is

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.000
 like in the, kind of, like, image."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.940
 They're like hyenas in the jungles, in Africa's apart. They're waiting, just anything. And then it

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.000
 will rob.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.850
 And for that reason, great master, Shanti, Shanti Deva said, "We are distracted. When we are

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.000
 distracted, mind is distracted.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 We are always, and things, F-A-N-G-S, I think, things. We are things of the emotions.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And we are distracted with things on the, on the jaw, jaw, things of the emotions.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.360
 Your friends with emotions, what emotions? Those five bosons, all those five boundaries, boundaries

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.000
, those boundaries.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Any time they can attack, any time they can, their jaw, the elbow.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 So this is what great master, I mean, the gracious teacher, Brother Hekim, he said.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.430
 Trying to watch out with those five rovers, five rovers, and then continually advance with the jaw,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.000
 in a divided appreciation,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 shaping, and accumulating six paramatas. And awarding the opposite of six paramatas.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.990
 Six paramatas, of course, many of you, almost everyone knows, but few of you know, six paramatas

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.000
 are generous paramatas.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:07.990
 Morality paramatas, and patient paramatas. Your effort to determine paramatas, and concentration

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.000
 paramatas,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:19.060
 and as well as wisdom paramatas. Those are the five paramatas. Opposite of that, trying to award

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.000
 the opposite of the six paramatas.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 And those are exactly, I think you all know, opposite of the generous practice, miserly grasping,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 and opposite of the morality.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:46.100
 Morality is, is then, unethicals, or not keeping up with conduct. Conduct as, as like normal sams

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.000
ara levels with conduct, as well as spiritual dharma.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.780
 Dharma as vinayas, or the parthima, vinayas, as well as bodhisattva, vedayana, those are known as

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.000
 then, not keeping up.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Kind of completely mixed up, and it diluted, and already jumping.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And the next one is the patient. Opposite of the patient is very, very unpatient.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Unpatient. All become so sensitive, and immediately kind of trying to attack someone.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Trying to attack with the verbally, mentally, physically. That is the opposite of the paramatas.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And of course, each of those are really big obscurations.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.040
 And the Buddha's teaching mentioned, and the great Master Shanti, they were saying, there is no

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.000
 worse obstacle than anger.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 There is no better virtues than the patient. Patient. Patient is so powerful. Powerful.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.240
 And so therefore, this, then, also trying to avoid those, I mean, trying to, even we got those

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.000
 emotions,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 strongly, but trying to catch, immediately trying to codify, free strengthening.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 That's known as mindfulness, alertness, immediately recognize.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 The great teacher, Buddha Shakyamintore, the value and importance of the mindfulness.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And we all have that, but we don't pay attention. We don't alert that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Mindfulness, alertness, consciousness.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 They are like, what great Master Janggu Kondra said in his teaching.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.460
 They are like, if you keep that, if you have that three, your great teacher, Buddha is right with

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.000
 you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 They are like living Buddha. They are really, in some other teachings, they are the inner masters.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Mindfulness, alertness, consciousness, they are the inner teacher.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.990
 Our teacher, spiritual teacher, all those out, but inner teacher, our true inner teacher, that's

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.000
 always with us.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 And we keep. And that is.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And then, the opposite of the joyful effort to dharma is the laziness. Laziness.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.850
 There is a laziness known as also laziness that attracted to the old lady in the Buddha teaching,

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.000
 of course.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Buddha teaching, there is laziness that attracted with old habit dependence.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 That attracted. Trying to just secure it because of our habit dependence, we call that.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.200
 Whenever we like to do something kind of like practice and meditate, and suddenly that shows up on

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.000
 the front.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Or I have to clean my cards. Or I couldn't clean for a long time my cards inside.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Now I'm going to clean now. And after that, I'm going to practice.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Of course, I take my dogs outside. Of course, my pet couldn't go out for so long.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 I'm going to take that, and then I'm going to practice.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.840
 There are so many good things, and kind of appealing things come in front of that, and then we lost

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.000
 that opportunity.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And then kind of also come, "Oh, this will be a long time. Now I have to eat."

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Or something like that. Those are days, you know, I can eat, and then I go.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And then kind of a little sleepy treat.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 So all these things get laziness.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.830
 And then also laziness in the Buddha take, you can imagine laziness is called sub, what's it called

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.000
?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Sub, disrespect with one's own self.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Disrespect for one's own self is also formal laziness.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 We should respect ourselves. Really respect.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.490
 We have after all Buddha take, in general Buddha take, we have beautiful seven, like eight in Dorm

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.000
in, beautiful eyes.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.660
 And then, and more than that, in the Buddha taking offering, this, our sub is weakly to close the

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.000
 ocean of the samsara.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 It's like boat. This is a boat. It's how spacious, how spacious, how spacious.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Because of this body, I can also activate the practice meditate, and do benefit for all the

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 sentiments through the body.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Without a book home, how I can help?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Soul space. And then Buddha nature is right beside in our heart.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Heart. In the very energy, then this body is not just a regular. It's five times a Buddha.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 That's right. And also in a, in a, we, we, we, we, we joined the Port in Dormpo. Port in Dormpo.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 What is it?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 This five, this body is five out of the gate. It's the other five living Buddha.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:15.590
 And with respect to the, this, this respect to our own body, we're making the Dormpo, I think, pure

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.000
 Dormpo.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Or maybe at Dormpo. I mean, we really joined.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 That leads so many ways. This is self-respect. So important.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And with that respect, then keep up the qualities. Your identity, your self.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And then, next one, opposite of the, of the, of the concentrations.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Opposite of the concentration is the distractions. Distracted. Distracted.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 When we're distracted by all the external, mundane world with the sensory pleasure object,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 all past memories, all future plans, all wonder, whatever. That is destruction.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.300
 During the meditation, for example, when you meditate, concentrating, we're not going to hold any

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.000
 of those.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:28.320
 Not memories of the past, nor plans of the future, not wondering on the prison time, these and that

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.000
 things.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Not recollecting of past memories of the, kind of, sensory pleasure object, whatever.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Any of those forms, we're distracted from the nature because we like to relax, calm and peaceful.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.510
 One single point in mind, we state this. State. And one necessary state is we like to stay and we

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.000
're distracted.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 So avoid those things. And then, next one, opposite of the, the verse of them is,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 then what's opposite of the verse of them is ignorance, not knowing clearly and opening our self,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 more, kind of, understanding variety. The knowledge is open.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Knowledge is not just one, kind of, glue in one thing and not really open in the door, door.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And at the same time, because of the, using the reason that I don't know,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 then saying that reason, ignoring the past, ignoring the future, ignoring anything.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Because quite much the reason, that means, oh, there's no past, there's no, not with the future.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 There's nothing any else because I don't see, I don't know.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So that means we are overpowering to our own unknowing situation and ignoring the old things.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.470
 And then deeper level, in the Buddha's teaching mentioned farmers and all different qualities, kind

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.000
 of, ignoring them.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 That, and that's those all known as the opposite of the six paramatas. And then you all know.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 So then when you keep that powerful debate with all that qualities, and then what is that?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Then we are accumulated to marriage. Accumulated to marriage and was still married.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.320
 And that same time is by, because of that, purifying the emotional obscurations and knowledge obsc

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.000
urations in the teaching state.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.240
 It will purify that. And it will then, our Buddha nature, as we talked yesterday in the video and I

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.000
'll teach you,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 or in the Zouki teaching, the Buddha is residing in our heart.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 But we have to purify all obscurations.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 That seven times of the human side or human height is underneath that.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.720
 What are those? Two obscurations, emotional obscurations, knowledge obscurations, surface of the

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.000
 emotional obscurations.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Those five organs or five robots are listed. They are on the surface, all the time on the surface.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:25.290
 In a way, guarding to not reword our traits, because ego coming in all, self-important, unknowing

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.000
 situations.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 What the great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 "Even the deep dawn, every living being has the intention to be happy in joy.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 But where we act, through ignorance, destroying the cause of happiness and joy and peace,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and running forward through the troubles, and the difficulty and the challenge.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Because what? It's because due to the unknowing, or ignorance.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.740
 That's the hierarchy. Therefore, many in the practical lineage sometimes say, "Kinder to yourself,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.000
 wake up yourself.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Please strengthen our courage and commitment.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Bounce back, not let fail dawn or fall dawn in the ditch, and lay down there in the ditch.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Get up, bounce back to the path, and advance. Stand whole, strongly, and then move advanced."

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Those are really in the teaching state.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.510
 So those are all kind of like, I mean, that, with those we were told and understand of the great

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.000
 teachings of the great teacher,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Brother Shachamuni, and as well as Brother or the great Master.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 And then, of course, when we reflect the teaching, then we join appreciation.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 But when we reflect, we work together, and kindness compares to all living beings.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 And again, of course, you all know, I mean, everybody, we heard something.
