00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400
 Thank you. Thank you friends. Thank you friends. Welcome. Yay. Here we are again. What a fortune.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.040
 What a really supreme fortune. So as we usually do, we'll reconnect with the ground, which

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.640
 is the path, which is the fruition, really activate our bodhicitta motivation. We do

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.840
 that with a tremendous sense of our own preciousness and worthiness and dignity and the goodness

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 of all beings. And then we extend that natural compassion to each of those beings who are

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.200
 so special and so important. We're all going through so many ups and downs, so many gains

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.280
 that we don't like, so many losses that we don't like. So extend that heartfelt genuine

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.640
 compassion to each of these beings. And then really connecting to that dignity, that inherent

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.720
 goodness of oneself, of all beings, have this pure perception, kind of, you know, without

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.440
 any doubt or hesitation, just kind of see that clearly. One's own goodness, the essential

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.160
 extraordinary nature of life, of awareness, this vivid richness that we get to experience

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.880
 right now with all these sights and sounds and smells and tastes, like really kind of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.080
 just be with what's happening right now. Connect to that motivation, renunciation, bodhicitta,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:02:10.200
 pure perception, kind of let that be everything right now.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 So the topic for today is merit, purification, and receiving blessings. So this is the topic

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:53.440
 of merit, purification, and receiving blessings. There's a lot here. And I've thought different

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.880
 things about this session, and it's kind of open. I'm very kind of curious about what's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.640
 going to happen today. So I thought to begin, if we each bring to mind a special moment

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.800
 we've shared with our teacher, whether that's Venerable Kenshin, Paldencher, Bernbuchet,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.500
 Venerable Kenpo, SÃ©o, Ondonio, Bernbuchet, some other great teacher that we just treasure

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.760
 that's so special to us, try to really bring to mind a memory of some time we had with

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 them where they really kind of were showing us such kindness. I want to take a minute and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.000
 we'll just kind of silently like try to activate whatever that memory is for you. Really connect

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.240
 to that, feel that, let yourself really fully sense it. Where was it? What was happening?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.960
 What was said? What was the look? What do you remember about it? So kind of really let's

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.240
 all take a minute and really feel that kindness, that specialness from our encounter with the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:28.840
 teacher. [ Pause ]

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.040
 [ Silence ]

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 Whether the Dharma stays alive for us is up to us.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.040
 [ Silence ]

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 If you've had the great opportunity to be in the presence of one of these noble realized beings.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.040
 [ Silence ]

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.040
 And that connection's there.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:52.040
 [ Silence ]

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.040
 And it's up to us to keep that alive.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 [ Silence ]

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.040
 Isn't that called empowerment?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.040
 [ Silence ]

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.040
 Isn't that personal freedom?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 [ Silence ]

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.040
 It is up to us if the Dharma is going to be something alive in our lives or not.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.040
 [ Silence ]

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.040
 We are the ones who have to keep choosing it.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.040
 [ Silence ]

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.040
 It's our path.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 We have the full power to continue on our path.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.040
 And it's not the role of our teacher to make us take the next step.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:59.040
 That's not the teacher's job.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:07.040
 The teacher's job is to show us the path.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.040
 And when we need help, that they help us however we're available to be helped.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 That's the teacher's job.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:25.040
 They're not a god.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.040
 And they care for us so much.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.040
 It's alive for them.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.040
 They keep caring.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.040
 Their heart is opened.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.040
 Their mind is clear.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 They can't not care.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.040
 It's impossible for them to turn that off anymore.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.040
 They're just waiting.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:07.040
 It's up to us to tune in to that compassion.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 We have a warm connection.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.040
 We're the ones who have to feel it.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.040
 If we don't feel it, we're the ones that have to generate it.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 We're the ones that have to create conditions that have it happen.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.040
 And these teachers are so kind.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:32.040
 They keep helping providing these conditions for us.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.040
 But they can't make us do it.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.040
 They have to take the next step, every single step.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:51.040
 How patient these masters are.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.040
 Merit, purification, receiving blessings.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:04.040
 All of this is up to us.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.040
 They can't rely on all of these lineage masters in their quotes today.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.040
 And we'll kind of free-flow in between that.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.040
 And Toko Urjinibiche, repeating the words of the Buddha.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.040
 If we want to quickly awaken to Buddhahood, it is essential to unite means and knowledge.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.040
 Whatever conceptual practice we do should ideally be combined with the recognition of mind essence.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.040
 Devotion and compassion are the heart of conceptual dharma practice.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.330
 The great masters of the Kagu lineage state that it is delusion to count on any method for

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.040
 recognizing mind essence

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:53.140
 other than purifying obscurations, gathering the accumulations, and relying on the blessings of a

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.040
 realized master.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 This means that no matter how smart or strong we are, if we don't follow a master,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.040
 and instead stubbornly push ourselves through years of meditation training,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:12.330
 without developing compassion and devotion, purifying obscurations, and gathering the accumulations

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.040
, we will remain deluded.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.040
 The essence of both devotion and compassion is actually the same. It is a kind of love.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.040
 Whether that feeling is directed towards enlightened pure beings or ordinary impure beings,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 whether it is devotion or compassion, the essence remains the same.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.740
 The mind is laid bare of thoughts at the moment the empty essence dons nakedly and can be directly

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.040
 perceived.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.040
 In the Kagu lineage, devotion is always said to be the main quality to focus on,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.040
 and so the Kagu lineage is called the lineage of devotion.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.040
 But compassion or devotion are the same in facilitating the realization of mind essence.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:02.040
 To reiterate, our training in devotion, compassion, purifying the obscurations,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 and gathering the accumulations should be combined with recognizing our mind essence.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.040
 Otherwise, to reach enlightenment using means without knowledge takes a tremendously long time,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 three eons according to the Sutra Path. The Vajrayana Path is much more swift.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:42.040
 Merit, purification, receiving blessings.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.040
 There are so many ways to talk about these three topics.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.040
 We accumulate merit with mandala offering.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.040
 We purify our obscurations with Vajrasattva practice.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.040
 We receive blessings through guru yoga practice.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.760
 And actually, each of these practices and all of the other ones in Nandro do all of these at the

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.040
 same time too.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:12.330
 We can think of them kind of separately if that's helpful, and it's fine. Whatever is helpful is

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.040
 helpful.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.010
 Today, I thought to look at them more in terms of merit and purifying and receiving accomplishments

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:19.040
,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.040
 like receiving the blessings and achieving the accomplishment.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:39.040
 This is more in terms of getting to the point. What's up to us, this path, taking the next step?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:46.040
 What's preventing it? If we look straight up Dharma, what's preventing it?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:15:04.040
 Self-absorption, self-cherishing, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, ego clinging.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:16.040
 This is the teaching, purifying obscurations. What does it mean? Removing negative habits,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040
 accumulating merits.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:26.040
 What does it mean? Creating positive habits, receiving the blessings. What does it mean?

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:33.040
 Non-habitual naturalness. This is the teaching of the Buddha, right?

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.040
 At the end of every Dharmapala practice we do at PBC, we recite these four lines.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.380
 Do virtuous deeds, avoid all negative activity, tame your own mind. This is a teaching of the

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.040
 Buddha.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:52.040
 Why do we even say that? Because we've asked all these beings to come for Dharmapala practice.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:58.410
 Some are enlightened and some are not. These four lines are said to encompass the entire path of

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.040
 Buddhism, the entire teaching.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.330
 So for beings of higher faculties that are really ready, that are really tuned in, that are really

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:14.040
 available to be moved and transformed by the Dharma, this is all they need.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:21.340
 Don't do bad things, do good things, tame your mind. So we say this, in case any of those highly

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.040
 attuned beings are around, we say that because it's the full 84,000 teachings.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.690
 So for those beings who've come, we ask them to come. Maybe this time they hear the full Dharma

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.040
 turning, just by us parroting it, just we say it.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:49.920
 Maybe it clicks on in their mind and they achieve accomplishment. Why? Because that's what happens

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:57.040
 when we're finally tuned in to the Dharma.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:07.290
 There's so many teachings on this. This is merit, purification, receiving blessings. This is how we

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:11.040
 let ourselves be moved by the Dharma.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:18.520
 If in the beginning, if we've had all these experiences with our teachers, right? So if you've had

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:26.040
 a great opportunity to be around these great teachers, then you have some memories, you know?

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:50.040
 Okay? So when we remember it, does it move us? And if it doesn't move us, why not? Ego clinging.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:59.040
 There's a million reasons to describe ego clinging. The infinite.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.510
 The path is devotion and compassion to the two fields of merit, devotion to those above, the freed

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:11.020
 beings, the noble ones, compassion to those at our level or below, sentient beings, we're all

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.040
 drowning in samsara.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.580
 That's the whole path, devotion, compassion, because that's all the beings there are, the free ones

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.040
 and the trapped ones.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.640
 And we're trying to have a warm connection to all of them, because for Mahayana Buddhists, they're

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.040
 both equally important.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:34.130
 Kim Bo Rinpoche went over this last week in his winter Dzogchen retreat webcast teaching on Paltra

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:39.040
 Rinpoche's fifth instructions, two fields of merit.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:49.040
 If we don't have that close connection, that close warm feeling, that's because of me.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:58.040
 At some point in Dharma practice, it has to come down to that point.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.800
 Specially for Mahayana bodhisattvas. There's no way around it. You're going to wait for everyone to

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.040
 be nice to us, and then we're going to try to practice.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:14.620
 Please give me a break. That's called eight worldly concerns. Everyone has to love me before I love

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.040
 them. Give me a break.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:27.040
 That's called ego clinging. That's called self-absorption.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:38.040
 You love me first, then I love you. Is that what these noble beings teach us to do?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:44.040
 And if we don't have that close, loving, connected feeling, then we have to nourish it.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:51.030
 And we have to open, and we have to ask for help, and we have to do what's helpful to make that

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.040
 happen.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:20:02.080
 The more we feel isolated, separated, closed off, distant, shut down, brittle, reactive, this is

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.040
 what happens.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:22.840
 We create this big gap of space around us, and then we wonder why doesn't anyone want to play with

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.040
 me? If we build a moat around us, how can they?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:33.040
 How do we put some bridges out there? Marry it. Do good things. Be nice. Try to get in their shoes.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.040
 What are they going through?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.040
 Purify the obscurations. Remove what's blocking that. Oh, the constant chain of delusion, right?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.560
 That person's this, that person's that, this, this, this, this happened to me, and it's so bad, and

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.040
 bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:58.040
 Is this pure perception? Is this bodhisattva? Is this Shravaka-yana, foundational Buddhism?

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.930
 No, it's not Buddhism at all. It's just self-absorption. It's not a spiritual anything. It's just

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.040
 narcissism.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.320
 Everyone, we're in that, me, me, me, me, me, the center, I'm everything. The Buddha clearly stated

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.040
 that's the central problem of samsaric existence.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:31.040
 The root of, the root of it all. The fundamental felt sense of belief in me. Me, not you.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:47.980
 This is the teaching, right? I mean, if we're really going to take dharma seriously, we can't only

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.040
 want peaceful Buddhas.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.040
 Everything has to be nice, and then I'll practice. Everyone has to agree, and then I'll practice.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:08.080
 Everyone has to look beautiful, and then I'll see them as a deity. This is not Buddhism at all. At

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.040
 all.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:21.040
 We're just letting ego-clinging, ego-clinging run the show.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.880
 As always, due to Rinpoche, counsels for my heart. These are general guidelines for worldly conduct

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.040
, worldly, non-dharmic, worldly conduct.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:39.500
 And then counsels for my heart, magical nectar. Such a famous, so profound. All success, great and

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.040
 small, whether in spiritual or temporal affairs, derives from your stock of merit.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.550
 So never neglect even the slightest positive deed. Just do it. In the same way, don't dismiss your

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.040
 little faults as unimportant. Just restrain yourself.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:02.190
 Make an effort to accumulate merit. Make offerings and give to charity. Strive with a good heart to

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.040
 do everything that benefits others.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.340
 Follow in the footsteps of the wise and carefully examine everything you do. Do not be the slave of

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.040
 unexamined fashions. Be sparing with your words.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:20.040
 Be thoughtful and examine situations carefully. For the roots of discrimination must be nourished.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.040
 The desire to do all that should be done and to abandon all that should be abandoned.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.750
 Do not criticize the wise or be sarcastic about them. Rid yourself completely of every feeling of

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.040
 jealous rivalry.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:40.170
 Do not despise the ignorant turning away from them with haughty arrogance. Give up your pride. Give

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.040
 up your self-importance. All this is essential.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.390
 Understand that you owe your life to the kindness of your parents. Therefore, do not grieve them

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:54.040
 but fulfill their wishes. Show courtesy and consideration to all who depend on you.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.600
 Instill in them a sense of goodness and instruct them to practice virtue and avoid evil. Be patient

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.040
 with their little shortcomings and restrain your bad temper.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.470
 Remember that the tiniest thing can ruin a good situation. Do not consort with narrow-minded people

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.040
 nor place your trust in new and untried companions.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.270
 Make friends with honest people who are intelligent and prudent and have a sense of propriety and

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:24.040
 courtesy. Don't keep company with bad people who care nothing about karma.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.950
 Those who lie and cheat and steal. Distance yourself but do it skillfully. Do not rely on people

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.040
 who say sweet things to your face and do the reverse behind your back.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:43.150
 As for yourself, be constant amid the ebb and flow of happiness and suffering. Be friendly and even

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:48.040
 with others. Unguarded, intemperate chatter will put you in their power.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.840
 Excessive silence may leave them unclear as to what you mean. Keep a middle course. Don't swagger

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.040
 with self-confidence but don't be a doormat either.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:04.120
 Don't run after gossip without examining the truth of it. People who know how to keep their mouths

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.040
 shut are rare. So don't chatter about your wishes and intentions. Keep them to yourself.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.350
 And whether you're speaking to an enemy, an acquaintance, or a friend, never break a confidence. Be

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.040
 welcoming towards people and smile and talk pleasantly.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:25.330
 Keep to your position. Be respectful toward your superiors. And even when things do not go well for

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.040
 them, don't scorn them.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.140
 At the same time, don't bow and scrape before the vulgar, even when they are proud and full of

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.040
 themselves. Be skillful. Do not make promises that you know you cannot keep.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.450
 By the same token, honor the promises you have made and never dismiss them as unimportant. Do not

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.040
 be depressed by misfortune and the failure to get what you want.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:55.680
 Instead, be careful to see where your real profit and loss lie. All such worldly conduct, adopted

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:02.040
 with proper discrimination, will result in this life's fortune and prosperity.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.040
 And so it is said, a speedy passage to the divine realms.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:20.050
 This is how to be a good, worldly person. He goes on to talk about what being a good Dharma person

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.040
 is.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:30.040
 That's the standard for a really good, non-Dharma person who just wants to have a nice life.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:38.040
 This is assumed that we're trying to do this as Dharma people. We have to be like this.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:45.040
 This is Holiness Dhujharma Chay's personal advice.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.040
 There's so many points of advice there.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.040
 Counsels from my heart.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:03.950
 I don't need to say anything more than that. You can't say much. Why comment on some things that

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.040
 are so incredibly direct and profound and obvious.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.040
 Just common sense obvious. Hard to do, but obvious.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:21.790
 Okay, so then what about the Dharma part? Because that was not Dharma. That was just basic good

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:26.040
 conduct as a common citizen of the world. That's the standard.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:32.040
 Okay, what about the Dharma part? Not for happiness.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:48.390
 The first step towards training the mind is repeatedly to recognize and reflect on the futility of

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.040
 Samsaric life.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.870
 As we've already seen, to continue to value any part of worldly life creates a loophole in our

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:03.040
 fundamental attitude that will eventually compromise our Dharma practice.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:13.080
 It is important, and therefore, to recognize the pointlessness of worldly activity, material

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.040
 possessions, and relationships.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.700
 And as we have already seen, contemplating the four foundations is a very good method for vividly

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.040
 bringing to mind just how terminally barren Samsara really is.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:35.910
 Even though the Dharma contains a vast treasury of extraordinary teachings, we can accumulate

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:46.450
 tremendous merit merely by listening to teachings on these four thoughts or contemplations over and

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.040
 over again.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:56.510
 This is called a common nundra. This is the four points that we recite. It's the four points that

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:03.040
 we yawn about when they're brought up again.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.950
 How do you put that down? There can be the nice, peaceful way to say this and the really direct way

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.040
 to say this.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:18.140
 The peaceful way to say this is care enough for yourself that you don't involve yourself in just

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.040
 trash.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.680
 Actually care enough about yourself to not just get caught up in the muck of some Sariq power trips

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.040
.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:40.040
 You're worth more than that. Love yourself that much. That's the peaceful side.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:56.320
 The more direct side is samsara only takes. It doesn't give back anything. As much as we invest in

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:05.040
 making samsara good for me, we lose.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:27.040
 It's just straight up fact. We try to make a nice cozy corner in samsara. The end is suffering.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:49.770
 That's the more direct one. Aren't they both loving? Don't hate yourself. Don't expect things that

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:56.040
 are untrue and in that way cause yourself all this unnecessary suffering.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:04.290
 Aren't those both loving? That's like the sweet advice of a kind parent who's been there and done

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.040
 that. They know.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:20.080
 But what can they do? They just show us the path. That's all they can do. They can't live our lives

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.040
 for us.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:31.160
 So now that's like a now we're in a Dharma context. We've seen the importance of merit purification

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.040
 and receiving blessings.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:43.290
 We've established that what it's generally like to be a good person. Now we've established a

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:49.040
 foundation of what has to be there as a bedrock for be a Dharma person in addition to a good person

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.040
.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:56.040
 In addition, be a Dharma person.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:02.780
 So what's a merit? And this is from Kambaramiche's book, Illuminating the Path. This is their

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.040
 commentary on Dijam Terasar Nandro.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:14.040
 This is like a stock filled with all these precious teachings. So this is Venerable Kambaramiches.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:21.020
 In the Nandro practice, we use two mandalas. The first mandala is called the wisdom mandala or the

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.040
 accomplishment mandala.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:29.270
 Within this limitless mandala, the true nature is already perfect and the accumulations of merit

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.040
 and wisdom are completely accomplished from the beginning.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.950
 By understanding the wisdom mandala, we connect with the primordial nature of enlightenment and

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.040
 experience the entire universe as the play of the three vajras.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:47.860
 Vajra body, vajra speech and vajra mind. Whatever we see is the indestructible display of the

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.040
 wisdom body.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:55.090
 Whatever we hear is the unceasing speech of the Buddhas. Whatever we think is indistinguishable

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.040
 from the essence of enlightenment.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:03.180
 The wisdom mandala of accomplishment symbolizes the totality of phenomena viewed from the vantage

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.040
 point of the awakened mind.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:11.550
 By using the accomplishment mandala to contemplate the true nature, our meditation becomes free of

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:18.040
 dualistic notions that mistakenly separate the meditation and the meditator.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.040
 The second mandala we use in Nandro practice is the offering mandala or the accumulation mandala.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.040
 Because by offering this mandala, we accumulate merit and wisdom.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.040
 We need the energy of merit as well as wisdom to actualize our Buddha nature.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.860
 To understand why this is so, consider how all our experiences develop according to the qualities

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.040
 of our actions.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.040
 All change happens due to specific causes and conditions.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:50.180
 In order to awaken an understanding of our enlightened nature, we need competent assistance and

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.040
 auspicious connections.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.310
 We already have the perfect cause, which is Buddha nature, so we need the supporting secondary

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:01.040
 conditions that come through the accumulation of merit.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.860
 By skillfully applying the six paramitas, we can merge all our activities with the primordial

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.040
 nature of mind, which is symbolized by the accomplishment mandala.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:25.040
 This is the way to cultivate our Buddha seed so that it blossoms into Buddhahood.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:34.120
 There's the already perfect wisdom mandala, and if we don't see that, there's the conceptualization

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:41.620
 that we generate in order to see that non-conceptual, already present, fully actualized wisdom mand

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.040
ala.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 That's called merit. Conceptual habits do good within this bodhicitta framework.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.330
 So then it's not just the result, "We don't get a worldly good thing," but it actually becomes

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.040
 something beneficial for all beings.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:12.190
 In that same other book, Not for Happiness, he says, "Marit happens whenever we do something that's

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:21.040
 not filtered through dualistic mind." That's merit.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:29.040
 It could be doing the laundry. It could be anything.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:36.590
 If we're not grasping too much on our own idea, if we kind of release that and let experience

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.040
 happen and we engage the activities, then that activity becomes merit.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:50.040
 What is merit? It's what life is like when it's not being experienced through self-absorption.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:57.060
 That's merit. Everything we do that's not filtered through the troublemaker, ego-ghost, self-

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.040
important ego-ghost, that's merit.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.310
 It's just constantly we can generate merit, and then there's more formal ways of doing this, like

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.040
 offering mandala to this refuge tree of enlightened wisdom beings.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:16.150
 They're a field of merit, and then we can do all these good things for sentient beings because they

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.040
're a field of merit.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:27.040
 Everything can be a meritorious activity, depending on our view. Again, it's up to me.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:41.040
 Every single thing I do could be merit. It's really up to me, my mind, tame my own mind.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:56.180
 And then purification. Again, illuminating the path by Venerable Kamparimache's purification

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.040
 practice.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:06.260
 The phrase "from the beginning, free of all extremes and complexities" describes the true nature of

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.040
 mind.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:13.040
 Everything arises as a relative transformation of that pure, absolute condition.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:19.920
 When we dissolve the deity, it's like returning to the original, all-pervading state, which is free

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.040
 from divisions into times and directions.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.040
 There's no partiality in the heart of perfect wisdom.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.040
 Dissolving into the primordial nature represents a big step forward on the path of the bodhisattva.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.690
 The true nature is free of any duality, such as birth and death, inner and outer, or existence and

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.040
 non-existence.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 All limitations are transcended in the innate condition.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.040
 So we practice merging back into that nature, relaxing into it without any limitation.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:38:01.040
 This is known as practicing on the absolute vadrasattva, inseparable from the teacher.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.040
 So this is absolute purification.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:13.970
 And then relatively, we're removing those habits we have that we created that block us from

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:22.040
 connecting to absolute vadrasattva, which is our own nature, right here, right now.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.750
 Again, the nature is here now, and the teachers and these great masters are pointing that to us

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.040
 again and again.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.040
 It's here right now.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.040
 It's you right now, already.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.040
 But they can't make our mind see it for ourselves.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 That's why you can't give someone wisdom.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:48.040
 The aha moment has to come from one's own side.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.040
 You can set up all the secondary causes and conditions.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:39:02.080
 But when our Buddha nature has to attune to the causes and conditions, otherwise there's no

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.040
 reception.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.040
 There's no softening.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.040
 There's no curiosity.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.040
 There's no willingness to be moved, to be changed.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040
 We're impenetrable.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040
 We're stuck.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.040
 We're fixed.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.040
 We're shelled off.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.040
 The cocoon of ego clinging.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040
 It's so kind of odd.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.040
 We're cocooning around something that's limitless and pure.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.040
 It's really odd.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:41.220
 We're so used to holding like this that when someone's like, "It's okay. Just relax. Just relax. It

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.040
's okay. It's okay."

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:48.040
 Then we just go right back into locking.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.040
 So this is going to take time.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040
 It takes time.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.040
 Each step, each step, each step, each step.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:01.010
 Gentle, gentle, we need to have the worldly conduct and the Dharma Foundation to turn our minds

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.040
 toward the Dharma

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:08.330
 and to do these activities to generate merit, this positive energy, our own positive qualities to

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.040
 grow them.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.660
 And then we need to stop growing the negative ones, reduce them eventually, like just don't keep

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.040
 feeding them.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.040
 That's the path.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:29.040
 And then all the path comes down to this, receiving the blessings.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.040
 All the teachings come to this point, receiving the blessings.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.040
 So we'll go again to His Holiness, Dujum Rinpoche.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:44.040
 In his book, the commentary on Dujum Tersar Nundro is "Torch Lighting the Way to Freedom."

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.040
 These are all treasure troves.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.580
 If we only had one of these books, that was it. That's all we had for the rest of our lives. That's

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.040
 it.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:41:03.040
 Then it'd be enough, each of them. That's such fortune.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.710
 The teacher is the embodiment of all the Buddhas, the root of blessings, the source of

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:11.040
 accomplishment, the foundation of activities.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.040
 Moreover, as far as we are concerned, the teacher is much kinder than all the Buddhas.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.350
 Why is this? Because at this time, when we do not have good fortune to see the Buddha in person or

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.040
 listen to Him teach,

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.040
 our teacher is the dominant condition for the Buddha's activity penetrating us,

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:37.040
 the link through which we can actually see the Buddha in the absolute body, the Dharmakaya Buddha.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:43.350
 In this respect, the teacher's kindness is inconceivable, and for this reason, our teacher is

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.040
 definitely superior to all of the Buddhas.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:53.040
 As we read in the Sutra of Immaculate Space, Ananda, the tatagatas are not visible to all beings,

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:59.040
 but spiritual friends, being fully visible, teach the Dharma and plant the seed of liberation.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:06.040
 For this reason, consider the spiritual friend as more important than the tatagatas.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:12.040
 This is particularly true here in the mantra vehicle, where all the deities reside of the mandala,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:18.040
 where all the deities of the mandala are embodied in the Diamond Master's body, speech, and mind,

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.040
 and it is on account of this that such teachers benefit beings.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:28.040
 So if we disrespectfully scorn them, or respectfully make offerings to them,

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.040
 we will be doing the same to all the infinite deities of the mandalas.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.040
 The benefits and dangers, therefore, are both much greater than in the other vehicles.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.040
 And this only goes on to say, next page.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:53.770
 Whether our teachers present in person are ordinary beings or emanations of Buddhas and Bodhisatt

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:54.040
vas,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.040
 if we are able to pray to them, considering them as the Buddha,

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.450
 there is absolutely no difference between them and the Buddha or Bodhisattva or Yiddam deity in

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.040
 person,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 because the source of blessings is devotion.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.390
 So whichever profound practice we are undertaking, whether the generation phase or the perfection

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.040
 phase,

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.040
 we should begin by making the teachers' blessings the path.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.040
 There is no more to it than that.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.040
 But as long as we have not received the blessings, we will not be genuinely on the path.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.040
 It is said that if disciples who keep the commitments give themselves wholeheartedly with devotion

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.040
 to an authentic diamond master,

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.040
 they will obtain the supreme and common accomplishments, even if they have no other methods.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:44.670
 But without devotion to the teacher, even if we complete the approach and accomplishment practices

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.040
 of the Yiddams of the six Tantra sections,

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.040
 we will never obtain the supreme accomplishment.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.040
 And we will be unlikely to accomplish many of the ordinary accomplishments either,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.040
 such as those of long life, wealth, or bringing beings under one's power.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:04.780
 Even if we do manage to achieve a little, it will have necessitated a lot of hardship and will have

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.040
 nothing to do with the profound path.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:13.470
 When unmistaken devotion takes birth in us, obstacles on the path will be dispelled and we will

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.040
 make progress,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.040
 obtaining all the supreme and ordinary accomplishments without depending on anything else.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:28.040
 This is what we mean by the profound path of Guru Yoga.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.040
 That's his only institution, Rinpoche.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:45.040
 The Turtan who discovered this Dijamtara Sarnandra from his wisdom mind.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.040
 We're just repeating the words of the Buddhas.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.040
 That's the best we can do.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:58.040
 That's what all the lineage masters do.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.010
 We're just repeating the words and trying to really let ourselves connect with that profound

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:06.040
 meaning that those words carry.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:13.090
 To be really open, to be moved and transformed by the really noble words whose sole intention is to

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:22.040
 liberate us and all beings from all the samsaric traps that we've set for ourselves.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:30.040
 If any of these words cause you to lock up and shut down and turn off or push away,

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:46.040
 is my humble request, please look at that kindly.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:55.040
 Love yourself enough to really look at that response.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:03.040
 All these quotes I've said today, they're repeated throughout all these teachings.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:10.040
 We're not going to find something better.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:15.040
 There might be something that for me in this moment, I'm more available for it.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:24.040
 And so for me in this moment, it helps me settle down and it helps my Buddha nature to shine up on.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.040
 And in that way, I'm ready for that.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:36.040
 But just because I'm ready to see this much doesn't mean there's not a lot more to see.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:48.040
 And we should get really curious about why am I holding like this when reality is like this.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:55.040
 And if this is protection, this is a really big point, gompo, protection.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.040
 We pay homage to the protector.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:10.040
 Having a wall can be the most important thing we do.

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.040
 Or it can be the worst decision we make.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.040
 What are we keeping out?

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.040
 What are we letting in?

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:26.040
 Is the protection helping my Buddha nature shine?

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.040
 Is it preventing my Buddha nature to shine?

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.040
 That's just a question we have to ask ourselves again and again and again on the path.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.040
 And that's what Drimp of Mindfulness is all about.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:43.040
 Is my Buddha nature shining because I'm holding, I'm poised in this way?

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.040
 Because holding isn't the problem.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.040
 Being unable to change our grip is the problem.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.040
 We have to hold.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.040
 Positive habits, positive holding.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.040
 Negative habits means a grip that no longer helps.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.040
 It's hurting, so we have to release it.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:13.040
 And eventually we relax and we can free flow between the different optimal stances and grips

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:21.040
 and ways of engaging and responding and being silent and emerging.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.040
 And why will we do that to really serve beings?

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.040
 Because we just love them.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.040
 And we love ourselves that much.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:35.040
 And the proper protection, like the actual noble protectors,

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:41.040
 their only interest is for us to keep on the path, to keep going.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:48.040
 And we have to be real clear, too, to protect ourself, to look for ourself.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:55.040
 Is this helping me take the next step on my path or not?

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.040
 And that's just a genuine question that every Dharma practitioner has to keep asking themselves.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:10.040
 Is this helping me take the next step on my path so that my vodhicitta is a little brighter?

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:24.040
 Or is it preventing that?

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.040
 Thank you, friends.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:31.040
 We'll kind of kindly put ourselves in this container of the nundra practice now,

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.040
 which we're so incredibly fortunate to have.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.040
 So under the protection of that mandala, this wisdom mandala of the enlightened nature

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.040
 that's been so directly pointed out to us by these enlightened masters,

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:52.040
 we'll kind of connect up with that and tune in to their wisdom blessings.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.040
 And we'll kind of follow in their footsteps

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:03.040
 by applying their teachings and seeing for ourselves if they really help us.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:11.040
 And I think we'll see that they really very much do.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.040
 Thank you.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.040
 Thank you so much, friends.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.040
 Thank you.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.040
 Thank you, friends.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040
 Thank you.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:28.040
 I feel like I'm really trying my best to really deeply appreciate and value

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:38.040
 and honor the fullness and the richness and the complexity of being a human being.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:45.040
 It's so extraordinarily rich and reality is so rich.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.040
 And I really I'm really trying to do my best.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:56.040
 And there's so many ways that we can we can flourish.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.040
 And there's so many ways that we can mend and we can transform

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:08.040
 and we can display our creative beauty and communicate and dance

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.040
 and grieve and love and the whole gamut of all of it.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.040
 The mind is so amazing.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:23.040
 I'm a really big fan of the full spectrum of humans, of mind, of sentience

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.040
 and all the different ways that we can like really creatively engage this

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.040
 and like use this and love this and love ourselves and love each other

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.040
 and love our bodies and love our companions and relationships

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.040
 and friends and communities and nations and planets.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.040
 I really I'm genuinely I really I feel like I feel that way

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:47.040
 and I'm really trying to kind of offer that a little bit.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:53.040
 And so similarly the the Buddha's teachings are so vast

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.040
 and there's teachings to tame our mind and teachings to train our minds

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.040
 and teachings to recognize our minds.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:10.040
 Sutra, Mayana, Tantra and there's peaceful teachings that are so soothing

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.040
 and nourishing and there's semi-peaceful semi-wrathful teachings

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.040
 that are kind of activating but still a little bit playful

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.040
 and there's wrathful teachings that are just direct

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.040
 and just like mirror like clarity.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.040
 And there's this full range of the Buddha's teachings

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.040
 and I think it's a great service definitely in my experience

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.040
 and I hope for you to this is all preparation

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:42.040
 to allow our other fullness of ourselves to come out to express

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.040
 we're like surveying the fullness of these methods we have

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.040
 and it's like it's fine if we get we have to really appropriately queue in

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.040
 and line up with what's helpful for me now

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.040
 and in my situation with what's going on and who's around me

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.040
 that's so critically important

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:07.040
 but it's also really good preparation as bodhisattvas, aspiring bodhisattvas

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.040
 what's the full range of all these other ways that people operate

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.040
 that the things that people are going through that's not in my sphere right now

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.040
 but like things I can queue in and learn about and get curious about

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.040
 so maybe when it comes up for me later I'm going to be a little more prepared

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.040
 or when I see someone else and they're going through it

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:33.040
 I'm a little more prepared like to be kind to really be with someone

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.040
 so like I feel if we ever get too cozy in our little corner of anything

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.040
 there's so much of the fullness of life and of ourselves

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.040
 we start just shutting off and shutting out and shutting down around

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.040
 and like that's always I'm always really kind of a little hesitant when I do that

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:58.040
 and it's just very as a bodhisattva commitment that we're saying

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:04.040
 may all until samsara is empty may I personally be the one

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:09.040
 to serve and uplift and free every single other being that's been so kind to me

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:14.040
 so really that fullness I mean just really honoring that richness

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.040
 that like right here and now we have to care like very locally

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.040
 with a lot of clarity and detail and lightness as much as we can

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.040
 but really hold it within a really big view like otherwise

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.040
 we're going to shut out a lot of the richness of reality

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.040
 and we're going to kind of basically limit how skillful we can be

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.040
 with all these other things going on around us

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.040
 so I say that one I hopefully I didn't like mistakenly present some teachings

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:47.040
 but I know also I can be on the more like kind of direct intense side too

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.040
 and so I mean also I can be on the soft little squishy crying side too

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.040
 so I'm trying to offer my full range of meanness okay

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:05.040
 please don't hurt me love you all thank you bye
