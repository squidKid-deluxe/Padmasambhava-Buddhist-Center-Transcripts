00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 Great. Again, thank you very much, everyone, as I said already, and welcome everyone again.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.040
 Thank you. Thank you very much for participating and making time and effort to organize the

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.260
 arrangement and all those things, and so many things, and then able to make and to get there,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.980
 and at least reminding and inspiring to each other, according to our capabilities, both

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.340
 our practice, our meditation, our spiritual journey, our goal, that what we're all following

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.700
 in the same destination, same aim, same goal, and same identity, same intention. So again,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.760
 this is the gathering of the Sangha members all together. As one mandala, we're just really

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.580
 trying to explore, as much as we can, according everyone's capabilities. In that context,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.760
 again always in the teaching said, and as always great masters, at one voice said, correct

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.820
 the motivation, intention, to begin to activate our practice, absolutely teaching, down our

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.100
 practice is relying on the motivation, not outside, to the material, to any other thing,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.900
 except our motivation. Motivation is our own mind, our own intentions. Intention is the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.060
 key to turn the engine and will of the spiritual and the Dharma. With all that intention, if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.180
 it don't change, nothing going to really happen. Maybe it's almost going to wrong directions.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.820
 Therefore, who has the intention, our ability or capability to change our own intention,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.860
 my own intention, no one else has besides myself? And each of you too. To change the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.460
 motivation and intention is absolutely 100% one is relying with us. So therefore, to make

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.660
 practical and more kind of sensible, more meaningful than always in the teaching said, all the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.460
 great masters from the Buddha, every one of the linear master said, correct the motivation.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.140
 That will make the Dharma as supreme Dharma. To observe in our heart and mind and begin

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.820
 to change our self of habit pattern. What are going to change? Changing the habit patterns.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.540
 Habit patterns, those unnecessary, unhealthy, and those all disturbance habit patterns that

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.220
 we all have. We carry that packages from the beginningless times. And each time we adding

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.260
 something more and more according to teaching, that was going to loosen up. It will every

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.220
 change the motivation. Well, we're reflecting the teaching. Well, we are practicing the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.900
 Dharma. Well, we meditating all like contemplating the Dharma. Really, according to teaching,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.580
 it will lose that kind of gluey habit patterns. It will change and loosen up. And we become

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.860
 more light, more peaceful, more happy. Those are in the teaching said. So therefore, again,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.340
 changing the motivation. This changing motivation is nothing easy, but to keep continuing is

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.180
 difficult. That is to apply the practices. Changing the motivation. What direction this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.060
 time? Again, joy and appreciation. Simple, joy and appreciation. Make reason to make

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.940
 joy and appreciation. See some kind of make reasons, kind of meaningful reasons. We have

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.740
 all the beautiful things to compare it with all the different world, different countries,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.900
 different places, different areas, and look to our self. We have every reasons to feel

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.140
 happy in the joy. Not just the only luxuries of the external, but we have some spiritual

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.460
 qualities, loving kindness, compassion, respect and appreciation, considerations. Those also

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.940
 we really have. We all have that. Those are the, we have to appreciate joy and appreciate

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.900
 it. Being grateful. Those are the motivation. It's not something changing. Motivation means

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.540
 we have to move the mountain or we have to do something big, gigantic things. Joy and

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.140
 appreciation. When we bring joy and appreciation and heart and mind, what it does, that we

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.980
 know, it brings more joy, more appreciation, more reach in our lives, not empty and hollow

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.820
 and kind of heading way. It really brings more richness. Joy and appreciation. And that

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:16.460
 brings what's called good heart, good heart, rich heart, abundance of heart, that's more

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.150
 meaningful. And combine that joy and appreciation, then both each other. We resist so many

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.940
 teachings.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.780
 Our joy and appreciation is not localized and kind of again with the ego clinging, grabbing

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.740
 and territorically restricting, expanding. We think that joy and appreciation, good things,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.060
 what we have, even better, every more to all the beings. Really, the gracious teacher,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.220
 Buddha Kya Kya Muni is teaching those four boneless prayers. If you have time before

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.740
 the practices, meditation, join those four boneless prayers, their mantras, their secret

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.140
 prayers. May all living beings breathe from the suffering, the cause of sufferings, sincerely

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:14.940
 wishing and express that with your, your tongue or your, we express how pure it is. We think

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.420
 of many times we join, we buy on a practice, we join, or just kind of a casual. But that's

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:30.020
 not really casual. Those are not casual. They are more rooted, deep, profound. Every open

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:39.180
 the door of compassion, that will change the whole of our directions. That's witnessed

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:47.300
 by all these great masters, great bodhisattvas. May all living beings have the happiness, cause

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:58.620
 of happiness, those prayers, the mantra, the secret word, really. How powerful, how beautiful,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:06.180
 how open, how so enlightened. Not just seeing those words kind of like, like as the kind

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:13.540
 of, without knowing the meaning. We all have the knowledge. We all started some degree,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:20.060
 but at least no more, what they were talking. How powerful it really comes. So those bodhisattvas

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.700
 are so powerful, so important. According to the teaching of the lineage of monsters and

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:32.540
 all that, even if we have practiced such more kind of fancy, beautiful names and all that,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:38.900
 but we lack of the bodhisattva, good heart, it almost become hallow, empty. It just then

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.300
 kind of like you, just entering them, almost we become the radios. We become just kind

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:53.980
 of like the broadcastings. Nothing is happening. Really too much. Just talk, talk, talk. But

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:01.760
 it really is kind of filled there from the heart. And then say those words, praise. That

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:09.620
 is practicing. Those are known as practitioners. Along with that, then the purity understand

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:16.620
 of the realization of the Vedayana teachings. Hold, everything is pure. Poem is enlightened.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:25.220
 Even though we don't see, and sound is enlightened. Mind and space are enlightened. Pure from

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:33.580
 the beginning, not just a newly arrived pure. Originally is pure. Those are teaching. Say

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:41.140
 do you know, we all, most of all us Vedayana practitioners, we receive those teachings.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.860
 This is not just a kind of like wishy-washy talks. It's attaching to the meaning, attaching

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:56.980
 to the core of the existing, of the way natures are. We are defeating, we are purifying our

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:06.100
 habit patterns of the cataracts. We really purifying. We removing that. And after that,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:12.400
 we started right now, according to Vedayana. Discover in the purity, we discover in the

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.580
 Akane star. Beyond the conception, we began, that process begins right now, when we begin

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:26.940
 the practice of Vedayana teaching. That's why we called visualizations or creation stages.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:33.180
 Those all the processes, the discovery of the nature, the beautiful nature, the ordinary

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:40.580
 nature, the inherent nature. Where things are natural that which is there exist. But

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:47.700
 we don't see right now that, of course true. That's what we called obscured. Obscured by

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.660
 our own habit pattern, our own creation of the habit patterns. That's what we are doing

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.860
 practices to play with according to Buddha's teachings. So with those understand, now we

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:07.420
 follow the teaching of the great master, great teacher, his Holiness, Dunyun Rambhuchis.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:15.580
 "Oh, Japji, Dunyun, Jagra, Ishii, Dorji." That many of you know and met and maybe received

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:21.660
 the teachings. And many of you maybe don't exactly met him, but we are meeting the, is

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.060
 meeting of the teaching of the, his Holiness, Dunyun Rambhuchis. That means, what's called

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.960
 the, teachers are divided many times and said, "Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya, or Bori

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:41.040
 speech mind." We are meeting the speech of the teacher. We are meeting the, also the

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.280
 wisdom mind of the teacher. And that is great. That is the value important. Physically is

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:54.780
 a changeable, but this ongoing, unceasing the continuation teaching as like Sambokaya

00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:02.380
 messages or richness qualities. And with the Dharmakaya mind, that is a great discovery.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:09.980
 That's a great contract and seeing the great masters. So in his legacy teaching that we

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.540
 are following this again, and this is teaching, we went, we went through this kind of going

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:23.660
 slowly by slowly. We're not just kind of running this and just complete this in this one session.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.360
 We can do that. I mean, we can do that. Or you can do too. I mean, it's all isolated.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.820
 We know translated that, but we're trying to explore the some degree meaning touch the

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:41.180
 best of the Buddha teaching and get some little bit knowledge of that, those newly that, and

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:48.940
 those who already started know, at least reminding, re-activating our knowledges and spy. That's

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.900
 what really we're doing. We are trying to do and we're doing that. So we went slowly

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:01.620
 by slowly. Last year we went through these teachings. And one way is so small, short.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.900
 But each Buddha teaching is actually in the teaching always said, even one syllables,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:16.700
 you just can discover the entire Buddha teachings. That means what? Eighty four thousand teachings.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.020
 All Buddha's teachings can discover from one syllables in the really teaching said that

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:34.680
 you can discover because they're one syllable. So such a such syllable are is a magic world.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:43.180
 From there you can explore entirely teaching with Buddha's and explain everything within

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:49.780
 that those who have capabilities. But at least we follow with this teaching and follow with

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:56.280
 all the other great lineage teaching, put together some degree and then kind of reminding

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:03.260
 to each other, the greatest teacher teaching, greatest teaching, teacher of the Buddha Khyakhman

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:11.060
 is teaching and lineage teachings to inspire us and support our practice in meditation.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.460
 That's what really we've been doing. So again, today, we do the continually similar way there.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:23.400
 And we went through through this whole, this first page, first page. And I'm going to go

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:32.060
 this last one today. Last line of this, this. Here, he's on the journey when he said, poor

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:40.780
 wealth of the practitioners, poor wealth. This wealth, as you know, is not material wealth.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:47.980
 This is spiritual wealth of the practitioners. There's full wealth. He highlighted four of

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:56.380
 those. The fourth one is this last line of this page, the page in particularly the devotion

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.280
 to the root teachers. That's the number one, I think, love and affection for the Samaya

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:11.280
 brothers, Sister. Two, the bodhicata of compassion power to all mother sent in beings. Three,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.280
 and the deduction of the grasping due to the knowledge that all compounded things are impermanent.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:25.280
 These four are what's named here, lastly, concluded title here, and are known as the

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:33.580
 four everlasting wealth of the practitioners of the Dharma, practitioner of the Buddha

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:43.580
 teaching, practitioner of the Vedayana practitioners should be regarded as indispensable. So that

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:53.780
 means keep these four points, all the practitioners close to the heart or in the heart. Keep these

00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:01.180
 four. When we begin the practice at the first time, maybe we have those things, quite seedling

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:08.580
 status, or at least one or two of those, quite seedling status. But along the way, while in

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:17.080
 practices, many times those wealth are fading away, many times. Then our Dharma practices

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.980
 kind of, instead, more accelerated, more strong, more deeper, in a way is a fading way. "Oh,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:35.380
 that I heard. I know. Oh, I read that in that." Seeing that word, it looks not so special,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:41.980
 not so important. "Oh, I heard. Oh, they say that." But what's happening? Then it becomes

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:51.180
 the heart is more dry and it dries. Intention and interest are going on, and all that kind

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:57.180
 of good, those old qualities are really fading away. Then what we're called, those old practices

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:06.680
 can become even worse than the regular, just like average, those other lay persons. Many

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:16.080
 times that happened in the past. That can happen again. Why? Because that treasure is lacking.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:25.980
 Wealth is reducing. Wealth is going where? Wealth is reducing. These four wealths, generally

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:32.580
 each of those, you have the kind of seedling wealth. It really will bring all that together,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.080
 too. It's not something that you have to catch one wealth and other wealth in this and that.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:45.280
 Each of those really will support each other, will have all that. Therefore, this wealth

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:54.780
 is kind of like skills of our practitioners, how our practice is going on now. How that?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.440
 That means, the practice means, actually Buddhism, we're not practicing to please the Buddhas.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:06.540
 Of course, Buddhas are very happy. Bodhisattvas are very happy, but we're doing this practice

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:13.860
 to discover our own innate true nature. We like to become the Buddha. That's what the

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:22.000
 gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said, every living being has the same potential,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.420
 same nature as Buddha Shakyamuni himself did. We like to move to get that realization.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:37.600
 That is not just like the story of the Buddha said, and that never happened. All those lineage

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:46.780
 masters, the 2,500 years ago, continued until now. How many great those practitioners reached

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:54.140
 that status? All those great masters, we call them great masters, they reached enlightenment.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.820
 They reach the high Burmese, seven Burmese, eight Burmese, all five Burmese, really they

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.720
 reach high realization. When they reach that, how and how they are, generally, they're so

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:15.420
 calm, peaceful, love, compassion, passion, and respect, appreciation, so humble, so simple.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:24.140
 That's the art, and they truly become the beacon of the world, beacon of the peace and

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:34.620
 harmonious respect and appreciation to all the beings. That's how that. So, therefore,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:41.260
 that we like to discover our own. Therefore, this wealth is so important to discover and

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:48.540
 gain our spiritual realization or enlightenment or spiritual goal. Among that, the first one

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:54.740
 is devotion to the root teachers. Now I'll talk a little bit about the teachers. Generally,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:02.260
 teachers, everyone has teachers. Even the lay schools, universities, schools, high schools,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:09.140
 they have teachers. There are many teachers. Then, as well as all the religious schools

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:18.520
 or the religious schools on the world, everyone has teachers. There are so many different

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:25.460
 terminologies and teachers mentioned. Everyone, and what their duties, what they do, they

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.900
 teach. Then, teacher means, according to every consulting system, teacher means they have

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:38.500
 some little more knowledge than others. That's why they become teachers. Knowledge. It didn't

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:44.700
 mean they're all enlightened. Maybe. Maybe. I'm talking according to the Buddhism point.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.700
 It didn't mean they're all enlightened, but they have more knowledge, more experience,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:59.540
 more understanding than the one's own selves many times. Therefore, they're called teachers.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:06.300
 That teacher is important. What it does, it ignites the knowledge. According to Buddhism,

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:13.740
 we have already no wisdom, but our wisdom is kind of like a dream or it is kind of like

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:22.200
 not so ignited, not so sizzling. The teacher will help to igniting to bring a luminous

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.980
 state according to our readiness. It really will help to enlighten them. That's what they

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:36.740
 call known as the teachers. The teacher is every level, every school of this world, there

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:43.400
 are so many teachers. But among the Buddhism, the teacher is so important. Teacher is important

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:50.260
 because teacher will help to understanding and discovering the meaning of the teaching

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:57.580
 of the Buddha. In that, for this reason, I go little, little details again on the teachers.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.540
 In the Buddha's teaching, generally, there are so many different teachers. But to summarize

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.420
 that, this teaching, there are four categories of teachers. Those four, maybe if you like

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:16.460
 to list it, you can list it. It's good. Good. You can write down that. Four teachers. Those

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.620
 four teachers are first teachers. If I start from top to, kind of down, from the top to

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:32.500
 down, pause it is teacher of Sambokaya Buddhas. So Sambokaya Buddha is number one teacher.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:41.160
 Second teacher is Nirmakaya Buddhas. That is second teacher. And third teacher is known

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:51.500
 as, or third teachers are known as noble teachers. Noble teachers. And I go over those meanings

00:21:51.500 --> 00:22:02.420
 after this listed. And fourth one is ordinary teachers. So there is poor teachers. First

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:10.100
 two teachers, Nirmakaya teacher and Sambokaya teachers, these first two teachers, how they

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:21.020
 are. According to Buddhism, they are free from obscurations. Totally. Full of love,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:27.740
 compassion and wisdom. All negativity, free from all the negativities and fulfillment

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:37.660
 of all the realizations. As a brilliant sun, shining in the sky, without any clothes or

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:46.820
 disturbances, their love, their compassion, their wisdom, their knowledge is immeasurable

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:56.260
 because there is no obscurations. No obscurations with ego clings, habit patterns. They're totally

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:03.920
 the perfect teacher every day. Perfect teacher. No errors, no mistakes. And then many of you

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.540
 already know, Nirmakaya Buddhas, Sambokaya Buddhas, all explanations. You all know that.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:18.340
 Many of you know that. So that is how these first two teachers are. First two teachers,

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:24.460
 the first one is, for example, Sambokaya Buddhas. According to teaching, to receive the teaching

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:33.820
 from Sambokaya Buddhas, you have to be very high realizations. At the Bhumi, ninth Bhumi,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:42.140
 tenth Bhumi, have to be both in Sattvas. To receive teaching. So for example, we don't

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:49.760
 have capability of that. We're not at Bhumi, ninth Bhumi, tenth Bhumi yet. It's our goal

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:57.140
 to be that level, but not yet. So we don't have, even the Sambokaya Buddha is ready to

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:06.180
 give us teaching, but we couldn't due to our habit patterns. We weren't able to meet the

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:14.100
 Sambokaya Buddhas. And then Nirmakaya Buddhas, also a difficult point, such as the Buddha

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:22.380
 Shakta Muni, Gurubhema Sambokas. Happened in the 2500 years ago, Buddha, great teacher

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:30.980
 came and taught and exploited all the teachings. But after 81 years or 80 years, Buddha entered

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:37.340
 Mahabharata in the runs. So that, after that, there's many great teachers came, Gurubhema

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:43.220
 Sambokaya Buddhas, also they came and in the way they go. We don't have really capabilities

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:53.340
 to meet them and receive teaching. Even they are ready. Then third one is known as the

00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:00.860
 noble teacher. Noble is Sanskrit word Arya. I'm translating Arya and the debate is called

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:10.420
 on Pakwa. Pakwa means those practitioners who reach the first Bhumi, first Bhumi or

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:20.180
 seeing path. From the seeing path all the way turned Bhumi, practitioners, are known

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:27.820
 as nobles or Aryas or the Pakwas, in Tibetan Pakwa. Why they call them Pakwa? Pakwa means

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:35.460
 elevated, elevated actually in the Tibetan. Pa means something elevated. What that means

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:42.140
 in the teaching said, elevated from the ordinary mundane conception, mundane ordinary beings

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:49.740
 to the noble higher status. Therefore the Pakwa. What in which sense? Because those

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:57.500
 post Bhumi or seeing path, they see the true nature of the great emptiness, exactly on

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:06.100
 the direct perception status, not intellectual, not theoretical, theoretical, not presumption.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:12.900
 They really see. Therefore is also known as according the path, seeing path. What is seeing?

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:20.460
 The true nature. What is the true nature? Egolessness, emptiness, subject and objects

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:27.620
 are empty. Empty, when we talk, it doesn't mean that everything disappeared. That's

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:35.540
 what we joined in the Heart Sutra. Poem is emptiness. Emptiness is form. We're rejoining

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.740
 that. What we got? Oh, we can't have the presumption. Oh, poem is emptiness. Emptiness

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.300
 is form. Can we believe the Buddha teaching? Can we think that? But otherwise, it is merely

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:58.700
 rejoining. But these great beings, practicing, seeing that, exactly as it is. Poem is emptiness.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:07.020
 Emptiness is form. Therefore is like magic. There's no solid structures, existence. But

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:15.580
 yet is functioning perfectly in the mundane world. What do we see? That is true seeing.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:26.980
 It's not poor seeing. Poor, F-A-L-S, I believe. Poor seeing. Poor seeing. It's true seeing.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:35.180
 That is novel. They are novel. That novel begins from seeing path all the way 10th Bimes.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:40.940
 Those great masters, we can maybe be able to see, such as what we call His Holiness

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.500
 these days in the Tibetan novel. According to the teaching, they are that status, some

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:53.380
 duty. Of course, I don't can tell exactly what realization, what stages they are. And

00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:01.020
 then many of those great masters are renowned, such as emanation of our lokide shorum. Gaurab

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:08.580
 emma sambam. Then truly, they have to be in those stages. Or maybe higher. But we can

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:19.460
 see those maybe. So those are known as third teacher. We are coming from top to down. Third,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:30.980
 pakwa. Pakwa, pakwa in Tibet. The fourth one is all-nity teachers now. All-nity teacher.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:39.100
 So-so jevova in Tibet. So-so jevova, regular beings. These regular beings, the teachers,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:45.420
 again how they in the teaching said, those who have been practitioners, who has the teacher

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:51.080
 that can be maybe really very big in the practitioners, or countless very expert knowledge and

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.060
 practices,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.820
 or teacher that can be in first two paths. First two paths, what are those? I'm sure

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:04.300
 many of you already know the path. Five path, when we call it five path. Accumulation path,

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:14.860
 application path, or in the Tibet is called cholam, jolam. Those are also known as all-nity,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:21.060
 but they are very elevated, not just regular all-nity. They're elevated with it. Very good

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.340
 practitioners. That's why they reach to the path of accumulation path. They reach to,

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:34.140
 that's why then from accumulation path they reach to the application path, jolam. Those

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.540
 are also these according to Buddha teaching. Those accumulation path divided again to three

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:48.540
 different levels, and as well as the application path divided in the four different levels,

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:56.940
 but however it means they are advancing. Those are the path and the bhoomis are the sign,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:04.700
 measurement of our practitioners' realizations, and that means the realization in the same

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:12.540
 time it shows how much emotions, obscurations are cleaned away. Cleared away. Cleared away.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.620
 So it's a measurement of that. The gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, lay out the every

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:25.340
 sign and a symbol of our inner journey, the spiritual advance and qualities. So they are

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:31.220
 all-nity. Then all-nity, there's a goal, maybe just a beginner of the, very beginner of the

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:39.020
 first accumulation path practitioners, teachers too. So there's many levels. So now this all-nity

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:47.420
 teacher, what is the teaching? Said then the qualifications, teaching, only teaching, then

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:55.860
 it's good to know, qualifications of the teachers, generally. And that contrast in Buddhism,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:03.260
 that you all know Buddhism, there is every talk, in particular Mahayana Buddhism or the

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:10.940
 Mahayana Buddhism, they talk about three different levels, teachings, three different teachings.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:18.380
 Those are known as basic Buddhist teaching or Vinaya teachings, bodhisattva teachings,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:26.700
 vajayana teachings. So that means practitioners or the teachers of those three different levels.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:38.860
 Vinaya and then bodhisattva yanas and vajayana teachers. Teacher of the Vinaya, that means

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:45.260
 basic Buddhist school, teacher of the basic Buddhist schools and teacher of the Mahayana

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:52.860
 schools, bodhisattva Mahayana school or Sauter Mahayana school, teachers of the vajayana schools.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:58.700
 So now I go a little bit each of those, one after another. Again, if you like to listen to those,

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.100
 those, those, and then you also you will have kind of maybe better understand if those people

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:11.020
 ever don't know and they like to know that. But generally again, if I talk, the teacher is so

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:17.660
 important in Buddhism. Important as a teacher, the Greek teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said in the

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:25.420
 Pandya Paramata teachings, siddhis. Those practitioners or individuals who like to reach

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:34.220
 enlightenment, like to the practices, at the very beginning you must search the spiritual friend.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:40.620
 Spiritual friend is another name of the teachers in Buddhism, spiritual.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:48.540
 Gabu-shini, Gabu-shini is ourselves. At the very beginning you should search the good

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:58.140
 or spiritual friends. And why? Because when your spiritual friend, again in the Buddha teaching,

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:08.700
 said, if you contact the good teacher, that will make you good practitioners

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:19.500
 and good person. Therefore you should contact the good teacher or teacher. So now we're talking of

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:25.660
 the good teacher. So therefore also in the getting there is kind of false teacher too,

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:33.260
 false teacher and good teacher, qualified teacher. According to Buddhism, Buddhism in these three

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:40.700
 different ways I already lay out to you. Vinaya teaching and Mahasutta Mahayana and Vayayana.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:48.140
 And the sutta Mahayana, sorry, Vinaya, Vinaya, those are the again summarized,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:54.380
 all the qualifications of the teachers in the teaching mentioned. Those are what? For example,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:34:05.420
 first is our sin. First, the teacher keeps the moral conduct good. First one is sutta mdi-kem.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:16.140
 So means have the moral conduct. Second, know all the Vinaya teachings, something in the bhachavasi

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:16.140
,

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:26.300
 darachwachi. And third is kindness and affection. Those for the needed student who needs some

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:39.420
 support, teachers are also very concerned and caring. And fourth one is all the students,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.260
 those who are associated, also they are going to come and feast for nice and quite good.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:54.380
 And then next one, and again I'm the list one after another, next one and then helping through

00:34:54.380 --> 00:35:02.700
 the teaching and helping through the material world to the students. And then occasionally

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:09.820
 also explaining the teaching as you need it, needed to kind of to make clear understand.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:17.340
 Those are the qualifications of the Vinaya teachings summarized. So now the first one is

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:25.740
 moral conduct keeping. That means keep the moral conduct. That means according to the teaching,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:31.900
 how much moral conduct that many of you already know in the Vinaya teachings,

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:43.420
 monks, the fully ordained monks over 250, 253 I believe, or 53, that. But this is not all the

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:52.450
 monks. And then there is a winner that upasaka, how much we have? Eight or ten, ten wows, sorry, w

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:52.620
ows.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:36:01.500
 Ten, eight or ten wows. And generally upasaka was at least five wows.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:08.540
 So that means they're keeping those wows according to what they are. Whether they are upasaka, male

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:14.300
 and female, whatever they are, or ordained monk and nun, whatever, and keeping the wows.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:21.580
 According to the teaching, in the Vinaya teachings said what means the keeping means at least that

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:29.900
 individually kept the wows for ten years without any mistakes and errors. That's considering quite

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:36.780
 stable. Quite stable. Stable. That is the quite good stable who keeps a wow like that.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.260
 That without errors. Whatever, whatever that wows, they proceed something of a choice.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:51.340
 And then next one is, that's the brilliant above past one. Second one is seeing that

00:36:51.340 --> 00:37:01.180
 all the knowledge of those Vinaya teachings, when she can perform and list and conduct that,

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:08.700
 explain of those wows clearly, clearly, and then if it's like fully ordered monk, see all the Vin

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:08.940
aya

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:17.100
 teachings, all those, how to perform, how to make purify, how to restore, all those instructions,

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:23.420
 clearly knowing that. So something in the rejoice. Then others are kind of easy to understand,

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:33.180
 easy understanding. So compassionate or caring and concerned for the, for the needed those sick

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.380
 persons or those people's and poor persons, but those students who need support in the way,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:45.420
 always available, those all listed. That is like qualification of the Vinaya teachings, teachings.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:53.180
 The next one is the bodhisattva yanas. Again, there's generally, there's so many descriptions

00:37:53.180 --> 00:38:02.060
 on the Vinaya called qualification of the Vinaya teaching, and as well as Sotr Mahayana teaching,

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:10.060
 but what I'm explaining or what I'm lay out is generally summarized more kind of popular,

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:16.300
 popular than what I'm talking, talking. And the Vinaya now, that is we completed kind of that,

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:25.500
 really mentioned. And now, next one is Mahayana. Mahayana, one way, what it said, the great master

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:33.660
 Chantideva said in the bodhikariya avatara, or santya sambhe kyobalan yukwa. And what he said,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:41.900
 he summarizes such so profoundly in the two statement in that teaching, said, the spiritual

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:51.340
 friend of Mahayana, expert on the entirely Mahayana teaching. That's the number one. Second is,

00:38:51.340 --> 00:39:03.340
 never give up the vows or the meaning of the bodhikata, even cause to life, cause one's own

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:15.580
 life. That too are the vows of the bodhisattvas according great master Chantideva mentioned.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:23.500
 So that means what again in the teaching said, that means of course it's summarized into two,

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:29.260
 but that means expert on the meaning of the Mahayana's. So that means the Mahayana

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:37.660
 entire teachings, all the Mahayana teachings, Mahayana teachings of the morality, Mahayana

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:48.860
 teachings of the meditation, sorry, Mahayana teachings of the wisdom, expert. And never give

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:55.500
 up the vows of bodhikata. And what bodhikata actually? There's two bodhikatas, related to

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.620
 true bodhikata, absolute true bodhikata. You know, we discussed those two and whenever you

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:09.180
 already know and read in the books, keeping up that two vows. And then it contains all the

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.100
 different things. You know that. So that's how great master Chantideva summarized into two.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:25.820
 True. But if we go let a detail of this, this, then in the great master Asenga, or as well as

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:33.260
 Arya materials, in the suttara alangaras, or the ornament of the suttara, which summarize

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:39.900
 entirely Mahayana teachings, all the vows are really teachings that were by great material,

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:46.300
 the future Buddha material. And as he did, taught that to Asenga and brought that teaching to

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:55.020
 available in this world known as suttara alangkara om dho de jinn in Tibet. There, great master

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:03.820
 explained 10 different, 10, 10 qualities of the spiritual friend, teachers, separate different

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:10.540
 or the teachers. Those are again, I try to list that and then go over a little bit each of those.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:17.180
 And then we like to write down again, you can write down that. Pose is the spiritual

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:31.260
 spiritual friend should be, and show up, peaceful. So that's one. And the second is gentle. That is

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:45.840
 true. Third is very peaceful. And that is a third. And good education, education, all that means

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.300
 also

00:41:46.300 --> 00:42:00.860
 good scholars. And good, joyful effort to the virtues. The next one, next one is the first one,

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:09.820
 and next one. And knowledge of the entirely reach of the knowledge of the teachings.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:16.460
 Knowledge of the reach, reach of the knowledge of the teaching on this very long flower. So

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:23.180
 and realization of the true nature. The next one is realization of true nature.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:36.780
 And quite well spoken or expert, quite expert to expand the teachings,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:49.340
 expand the teacher. And then, and very kindness and compassion. And, and very tolerables,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:59.820
 tolerables, tolerance, or without tired or the bored, B-O-R-E-D-A, I believe bored.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:06.380
 Though I believe there's a 10 now. 10, right? Yeah. Those are the 10 qualities

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:15.820
 of the spiritual friend of the Mahayana teaching. Explained little more extensive of the post

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:24.460
 chanting there was a true summarize. Now, the first one. What means the first one is peaceful.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:34.220
 Means the first one, peaceful means that person is peaceful and a gentle conduct,

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:42.780
 keeping up all the vows. Whatever the vows they received or keeping. So because therefore it is

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:54.720
 peaceful. Not wild, not irregularities. B-O-R-E-D-A, don't to the ground, grounded, don't to the

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.020
 earth.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:07.100
 And the second is gentle, gentle need, gentle of the mind because the concentrations,

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:14.540
 meditations, the wild mind is reduced to the gentle, gentleness states.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:25.900
 Fourth one, sorry, third one, very peaceful means understand the wisdom. Their wisdom

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:33.100
 is quite good. So that means what? According to Buddhist conscious, three extra ordinary teachings

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:39.420
 or practices. They really practicing. That means they had the morality, they had the concentration

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:45.020
 or the spiritual friend. They have also practicing of the wisdom. And those are the

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:54.860
 extra ordinary training practice of the Buddha teachings. Why use the extra only teachings?

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:04.460
 Extra ordinary. Generally it means many schools has moralities. Many schools has concentrations.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:12.780
 But many schools, schools has the wisdom. But Buddha's wisdom teaching is quite going beyond

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:19.340
 further than that. Because of the movement, the ego clinging, attachment, negativities.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:27.260
 Therefore, these three extra only teachings, that's what's named three extra ordinary teachings.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:36.460
 Not just ordinary three practices. It is extra ordinary practice because it goes beyond further.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:44.780
 Fundamental of the old troubles is the ego clinging and negative emotions because they are

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:53.100
 direct. These teachings are direct to undermine or uproot or dispel, purify those three,

00:45:53.100 --> 00:46:01.420
 those obscurations. Therefore, it's called extra orneries. So those are the first three.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:12.620
 And then the third one is easy. That means the teacher is more knowledgeable than one's own self.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:18.540
 That means one's own self is a student. We are a student, but we are in the teaching said,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:26.700
 if we are equal, there's nothing much really can help. Even lower than our self also can't help.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:35.180
 Therefore, let it be more better knowledge than our own self. That's why then the college of the

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:42.620
 teacher, let them own knowledge, experiences, and understanding of one's own self. So exceeding,

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:52.460
 call it, I believe, E-X-C-E-E-D, maybe exceeding call it, is of the knowledge of the Buddha

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:58.140
 teaching. This time we're talking Buddha teaching, not science, not any other things because that's

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:06.810
 what we're talking about the teaching. So little better than that. And the next one is joyful

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:07.260
 effort.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:16.220
 We're choosing joyful effort. That teacher has joyful effort to help to the others and help to

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:23.500
 keep up the identity, call it, with the teachings. Teaching is not convoluted and neglecting that.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:31.100
 And that is call it, another call it of the teachers in the teaching. The next one is

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:37.820
 long gives out, reach of the knowledge of the Buddha teachings. That means, again,

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.460
 you all know this Buddha teaching is then those all teaching, Sutra teaching,

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:50.460
 when I am teaching, Sutra teaching, Abhidharma teaching, and then also come, all those Buddhas

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:59.100
 his own Sanjiv, Kwa, Kwa, and Timkyu. Kwa means his Buddha's own world teachings, and Timkyu means

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.580
 all the commentaries on the Buddha teaching. So those, whatever they have, I mean,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.420
 of course, of those excellent teachers, such as the great master, Dung Kimpa,

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.300
 great master, Mohan Rinpoche, and all those things, ancient times and modern times, such

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.340
 as his only Dalai Lama. I mean, so many great teachers, really, they know so many, all those

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:23.900
 teachings. And then his only Dalai Lama, who is not now, but he was not too long ago having that,

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:31.180
 and his only thing, those have so much knowledge and understanding, all that just, their teachings

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:37.580
 are flowing on from the really just, and to kind of sometimes we think, where that coming from?

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:43.900
 They just, it's really coming. And all those teachings are so great masters. So like that,

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:49.340
 I mean, that is what the qualification of the, one of the qualifications, according to this,

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:59.180
 is the teachers. And the next one is, and they have the realization, not just speaking and talking,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:05.500
 talking, but have realization. That way you practice it, meditate it through the studying,

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:12.220
 contemplating, meditating, practice, again, realization, some real realization, have the

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:21.900
 realization. That is then, that is the, that is one of the qualities in terms of all. And then,

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:28.780
 when the teacher gave the teachings, teachings also expounding that teaching, according to the

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:35.580
 readiness of the individualist, the readiness of the audience, and they are kind of understandable,

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:41.740
 accessible, kind of teaching, pronouncing so nicely, and can understand that. That is one of

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:50.380
 the qualities, teaching. And then also, the next one is kindness and compassion and caring thought.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.340
 We never, even even needed, they need, they have more love, more kindness, compassion,

00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:00.380
 not just a kind of walking that on the surface level, from the heart, is really like to help and

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:08.780
 support and move forward, along with the teacher, him or herself. Kind of that sincerely thought,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.980
 not just the only best on the materials or something that, but really truly from the heart.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:20.940
 Heart like to help and support. That is one, the ninth one, I believe, ninth one.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:30.820
 And the next one is, and the very tolerance, and the difficulty, troubles, troubles, whatever comes

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:30.940
,

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:37.180
 the relationship with the teachers and the student, all happening that, but not so temperament,

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:44.140
 temperamentals, or not so kind of short temples, but have some tolerance, and understandable,

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:50.060
 and not bored and tired with whatever is happening, something, continually keeping,

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:58.940
 kind of inspiration, courage, and commitment. And those ten are, then, according to Mahayana

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:07.980
 teaching, those are the qualities of the teachers. Teachers. And that is really about this. Now I

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:14.540
 will go really, this third one, quality, and then we stop here. And third one is Vaidyana teachings

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.780
.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:21.020
 Again in Vaidyana teaching, you all know, I mean, we all heard that. I know, I heard, you heard,

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:27.260
 we all heard this. There is three outer tandoora and three inner tandoora and all that, but I talk

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:33.260
 with three inner tandoora, among that, will encompass also others too. So again, according to

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.820
 Numa teaching, in the Numa schools, what to be the business, according to their teaching, this

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:47.260
 their teachings. And this is also according to the inner tandoora teaching of the Numa schools,

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:55.980
 Mahayana-yoga, Ata-yoga, and this is according to Mahayana teachings, teaching said. So those are

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:04.220
 highlighted, call it, of the ad, ad call it. First is what we explained, or we were told in the

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:13.580
 teaching, I will say that, that said, and have the three trijals, three trijals. And the fourth one

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:25.100
 is, again, you listed that. So then three trijals, and the fourth one is all the dam, d-a-m-p, I

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:25.820
 believe,

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:34.380
 dam of rivers completely merged, or the river of the, river of the, river is merged to the dam,

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:42.460
 dam or the reservoir, reservoir water, reservoir water, had all the waters that, so that is port,

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.340
 port.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:59.500
 Third, and the fifth one is responsibilities. And the sixth is, is expert,

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.820
 all the knowledgeable, maybe I use knowledgeable, knowledgeable to the tantrums.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:16.060
 And the seventh one is knowledgeable to the, the ceremonial or actions, activities.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:37.020
 And the eighth is, realizations, or trust and change means realization of the warmth of the

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:46.780
 lineage, or lineage warmth, realizations. So those are the eighth qualities that we explained

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.460
 in the Mahayoga teachings. Again, there's many, but this is summarized, summarized that,

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.060
 and now the fourth one, three trijals. What are the trijals?

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.780
 Trijal of the,

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:14.220
 trijal of the creation stage of the Mahayoga teachings, teachings, so keeping the trijal of the,

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:21.500
 the creation stage of the Mahayoga teaching. Third is, the complete trijal of the,

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:28.220
 complete stage of the, of the Anu-Yoga teachings. And the third one is,

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:36.380
 trijal of the realization, the view of the Ati-Yoga teachings. Ati-Yoga teachings. So that means,

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:43.420
 have knowledge, that means the, the Mahayoga understand or the meaning of the Mahayoga teaching,

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:49.420
 Anu-Yoga teaching, and Ati-Yoga teachings. Mahayoga teaching is the, mainly teaches,

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:56.220
 what's a high light, again, is not just only that, but teaching. So on the, on the visualization or

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:56.620
 the

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:02.300
 seeing everything is a purity status. What we're talking earlier, that seeing everything, purity,

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:11.660
 poems are purity status. Elements are, not purity, poems are enlightened. Elements are enlightened.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:17.020
 There's nothing is not enlightened. The ordinary enlightened, those in the Mahayoga teaching,

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:22.780
 everything is enlightened. Even the Buddha is looking something in, unenlightened,

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:28.780
 never going to find anything. The Buddha's omniscient wisdom, radar of the enlightenment,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:35.980
 is searching everywhere, trying to find something is not impure. Or something is impure, sorry.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.980
 Something is impure if they look, there's nothing well Buddha find. Everything is purity state,

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:50.620
 enlightened status. That is Mahayoga's teaching. In the, in a related truth, everything is a purity

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:55.740
 state, absolute truth, everything is a great emptiness state, or they're completely union,

00:55:55.740 --> 00:56:04.410
 in one unit status. That is Mahayoga teaching. And in Anu-Yoga teaching, every, all our existing

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.180
 forms

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:15.180
 are totally enlightened. Everything is completed. Greater completion. Channels, chakras, and all

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:15.340
 the

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:22.160
 limbs and everything is enlightened. Everything completed, nothing is missing. From what, completed

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:22.300
?

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:31.100
 From the enlightened. Everything is enlightened status. That is really principle. And then that's

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:36.460
 what seeing everything. So external is enlightened, inner is enlightened. Everything is enlightened

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:44.470
 organically. Activating that qualities and teaching on that is the principle teaching of the Anu-Y

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.860
ogas.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:55.100
 Anati-Yogas, they, the mind is already enlightened status. In the light state of the three kayas,

00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:02.940
 Dharmakaya, Sambukaya, Narmakaya, all really enlightened status. That is the treasure. Those

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:11.900
 are the treasures who hold, have the realization at those treasures. That is a keeper of the

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:21.100
 treasures. Then all the rivals of the, of the, completed to the den or the reservoir, what those

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:29.580
 teachings, all, all the empowerment, lineage and structure, the empowerment are completely

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:36.860
 hold by the teacher, that teachers. And those are known as like external empowerment, inner

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:47.500
 empowerment, secret empowerment, all, yeah, all beneficial empowerment and, and powerful

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.460
 empowerment,

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.900
 profound empowerment. Those are different terminologies where all the empowerment are keeping,

00:57:53.900 --> 00:58:02.700
 keep completed to that teaching or hold received that, that teacher received that, whether that's

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:11.020
 the he or she, those are qualifications. So that is the, the, the fourth one. And the fifth one is

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:17.100
 the responsibilities. That's the responsibility being who keeping the responsibility of the

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:24.540
 teachings, not just the kind of like using that as tool to the purpose of the samsara activities,

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:33.580
 but upkeeping the lineages, have responsibilities, honoring, respecting, maintaining, preserving

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:40.220
 that. And the same time that help to the student also helping the supporting, taking care of that,

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.380
 not just about because of material levels, but it's spiritual connection level,

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:51.980
 keeping their connections and having that and feel the relationship, connections, let grow,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:58.620
 help and support that also those students who are connected to you help and support with the

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:05.820
 responsibility, genuinely responsibilities supported. So that is called responsibilities.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:14.940
 Next one is then export all the knowledge about the tantrums. And that is again,

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.820
 the outer tantra, inner tantrums. And then generally, according to the Vedayana teaching,

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:26.300
 always the expert on the nayana teachings, all those nayana teachings. So that means

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:34.060
 entire, some really knowledge and understandable, entire Buddha teachings, expert, expert. And next

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:42.300
 one is, is the expert and knowledgeable of the ceremonies. Ceremonies in the Vedayana,

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:49.100
 there's a lot of ceremonies, guru ceremonies or drifts, and so forth. And there's also related

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:55.740
 with actions, activities, such as poor activities, activities, and then correlated with those,

00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:03.150
 there's ritual ceremonies, and the yajnas, all the, all those offerings and the mantras and mandal

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.420
as,

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:09.180
 and it's all kind of expert, some degree, those qualities. So those are expert and knowledgeable

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:16.620
 with those qualities. And next one is then not just only on that outer world, but that

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:24.860
 teacher also practicing and keeping that, that warmth of the knowledge, sorry, non-knowledge,

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:34.460
 warmth of lineage, keeping that lineage teachings intact and whole. So that I think the Ed really

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:41.740
 went at those, those what told in Mahayana teaching and which is encompassed all that. So according

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:41.900
 to

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:49.580
 teaching, teaching of the Buddhism, if you have this call address, they are the perfect teacher,

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:57.260
 perfect teacher in the standard of the ordinary teachers. Remember, we have the four categories.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:04.540
 This we're talking of ordinary teacher, the Arya, the Bodhisattva teacher, and the Nirmakaya

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.260
 teacher,

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:10.620
 Sambokaya teacher, we don't have to mention that. They all have that completely, that

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.340
 really they don't have. We're talking this call of forgiveness with ordinary teachers.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:22.540
 And if these ordinary teachers had these call addresses, they are known as perfect teachers.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:29.260
 But however, in the teaching set, in the teaching set, in these degeneration times,

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:37.420
 it's difficult to find the teacher who has all those call addresses. And even they have,

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:45.900
 maybe our knowledge is so weak that we don't recognize everything. So therefore, if there is

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:53.180
 that, that kind of like, what's called the cornerstone of the symbol sign of loving kindness,

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:58.940
 teacher who has a love and a compassion, respect and appreciation, and keeping up the dharma

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.660
 according to the Buddha's teaching, the best capabilities, not just only relying on the

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:10.620
 materials, not kind of like desiring and chasing the materials. And so that means what in the

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:21.100
 teaching set, and less desire, more contentment, and with the love and the compassion, and has

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:27.580
 responsibility to keeping up the Buddha teaching and lineage teaching, and kind, if we find that,

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:36.380
 also really, then quite good teacher, quite good teacher, that can help us to inspire our

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:45.500
 Buddha nature to grow and deepening, deepening that. So that is my brief tour of the, of this

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:51.100
 first one. And then if you have these, again, of course, I go this, when you have that, then you

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:57.420
 should have that these devotions, particularly devotions, we find teacher like that, then a

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:06.700
 devotion is, again, what's called the devotion is paired, F-A-I-T-H, paired, paired, then it

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.020
 becomes

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.300
 the devotion, the devotion is maybe more with the love and the compassion and the affection to each

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:18.460
 other. Affection cannot just kind of feel something special, this and that, but also really, we are

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:25.020
 sharing similar things. So those, and then really rely and learn and grow. So those are mentioned,

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:31.100
 but I go over those things continually. So this means first, this first line, I went a little bit

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:38.320
 over, or talking a little bit deep, little bit more deep, and so that will kind of help to each

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:38.700
 other

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.980
 us. And thank you very much again for your participating. Thank you. Again, we see tomorrow

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:49.420
 every year of time. And again, we do short dedication prayer here, and then we completed

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:56.060
 our teaching session. And then after that, we will do the healing practices. And then along with

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:56.220
 that,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.900
 we do here in the Pima Sami in the Monastery, we do every day Dharmapala practice. So we're going

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:10.620
 to do those practices right after this, one after another we do. So we do short dedication prayer

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:15.980
 right here. And those people who don't have time to stay all those practices, then you can, I mean,

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:20.860
 that's the session we completed. And tomorrow we started around 10 o'clock in the morning,

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:26.060
 I think 10 o'clock morning. Then we see again, every year of time. Thank you very much, everyone.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:31.500
 And again, for participation. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Now we do short

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:37.660
 dedication prayers. Okay. But you have this booklet, or otherwise we do dedicate narratives,

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:43.180
 that what in the teaching said. Thus we did the studying and contemplate on the teaching of the

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:50.300
 Greek teacher, Buddha Xactamuni. Whatever gained the merit, we share this merit to all the beings

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:56.300
 now and forever to everyone and for their enlightenment, for their goodness. So therefore,

01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:03.580
 please join your intention with our prayer. So let us share to get this merit. Also in the teaching

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:12.940

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:56.940
 [Singing]

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:02.940
 By this merit, may all of the nominations, may it defeat the enemy around them. From the stormy

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:08.380
 waves, the birth, the origin, the sickness, and death. From the ocean of the samsara, may I pray

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:15.420
