00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 "Realization, generally in Dokki meditation, when you continue meditating practices, such as

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:14.000
 foundation bundle practices, and that, and then also this visualization or the sadhana practices,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.870
 and then we need to continue practicing meditating, and those are known as Dokki, of course, as

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.920
 true practices, and that as you all know.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.180
 Dokki meditate, Dokki practices, and Togal practices. Dokki is what makes Dokki is very old, of

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.440
 course, you all know. Dokki means cutting thoroughly, cutting instantly. And that, what that means?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.800
 Cutting duality instantly. That really is the cutting.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:54.860
 Duality, that's that. When you cut duality, what way we reach? We reach to the purity state, the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:04.780
 natural state as it is. Natural, natural state of mind. And that is a Rupa, pure from beginning. N

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.800
appa, Rupa. And a Rupa is also a name, many times, the ordinary mind.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:19.940
 Only the mind, not deluded, not fabricated by anything. Simple, plain as it is. That is also Tamil

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.800
 Pichi in the teachings. Tamil Pichiva is not, only the mind, is not dualic mind. Free from duality.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:39.510
 Duality mind is decorated mind. Decorated of duality. Decorated in the public entity. But this

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.800
 ordinary mind is free from duality.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.720
 Again, in the teaching, the great master, the great master Jai Moolamma said, "Everything old in

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.800
 mind means dualic mind. We lost it."

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.010
 Dualic, old in mind, in the Dokki teaching, when practicing, if they say that, "Old in mind means

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.800
 mind, that which is from duality."

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.260
 Dualic mind. That means what? Mind is from the emotions, negative emotions. Negative emotions are

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 what? Free from the ignorance, free from the attachment, free from the anger, free from the jealous

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.800
ness, free from the arrogance. All combination of those.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.540
 That is, when it is free from that, in the practice, Tamil Pichiva, Tamil Pichiva, old in mind

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 means free from the duality mind, that is free from duality.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 That is ordinary. That is the best thing, nature. Grown nature. Nature. Nature.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:54.100
 So, when you reach that status, then what it does, in the teaching, when you reach that status,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:04.800
 finally to the cave, cave of the grasping and hub in the field, convert or collapse.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:21.280
 Cave. Or, cave? Or, maybe I translate the cave as like the tunnel. Tunnel of the grasping and hub

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.800
 in the field are collapsed.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:35.730
 Then, that ego cleans the gong. Attachment is the gong. Negative is the gong. All gong. So, that is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.800
 what you really reach.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 In the Dokki teaching, I think I will say later, that when you practice, the other two practice,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 and then continually you are advancing the practice.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 Those are known as, as you all know, path. You are advancing the path.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 Path is, of course, a term, a metaphor, that metaphor, but it is not something externally existing.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.800
 Path is a realization. Path is a realization.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:26.070
 In the teaching, always say, path, most of them, southern chamber, and path, most of them, and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.800
 realization are the tenonim.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 They are the same. Same.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 In this state, path means you are advancing or discovering the inner nature of our mind.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.660
 Why are you saying mind? A colder teaching, when we discover the inner nature of the mind, we will

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.800
 discover.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 Then, we discover all it is objects. What that means? The whole five objects.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 Then we also will purify five objects, too. We purify poem. So, poem becomes more pure.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:23.790
 Poem, song, smell, taste, and touch all become pure as we pure our mind. Pure from what? Again,

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.800
 like duality.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.130
 Grasping. When we are freeing duality, then we begin to see external things are more pure and

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.800
 simple to tell.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 Then, that's what's called the pure land.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.820
 In many times, our great master, he's from Dunyun, but he's one of his last teachings, he said pure

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.800
 land is not outside.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 Have you let to see the pure land remove the dualities?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 Remove the dualities. That's what great master, he's from the Dunyun, said.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 See, I mean, that's all the teaching said. As much as we are pure, our duality mind, that much,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800
 they didn't really see the pure.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:21.490
 Again, if you have the realizations, when you have some realizations, you will keep that as

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.800
 personal qualities.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.010
 Realization should not express to the others. Actually, in the teachings, when you have the good

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.800
 realization,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:40.050
 really local yogis never expressing or boosting their realization to anyone, to others. Keep

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.800
 listening.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.800
 Maybe you can tell to your own teachers, but other than keep as quiet and peaceful.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 Even use example, keep as a stone in the ocean. Ocean, that's really how you keep it.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.660
 Humble and simple. It's not boosting. Boosting. Every life to show the realization, show your

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.800
 compassion,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:14.360
 show your love, your kindness, your patience, respect to the others, all things, being great for

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.800
 all others.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 That is, then, maybe the probability, but then he has some realization. Really think.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 Just say, "I have the realization. This, of course, it's booming second, booming this and that."

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.790
 All that. That accumulation part, the application part, the seeing part, all those, those are the

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.800
 boosting.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:43.800
 Boosting of the realization, and we are cold and very energetic, we are breaking Samanas. Samanas.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.020
 Those are in the teachings here. So therefore, even though those advancing, the realization is

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.800
 booming in that,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 by the part and meditate with your devotion, your body is boosted, and that should be kept or

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.800
 continually carry more body together,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.800
 more devotion, until we reach enlightenment. So when we practice this, and then in the looking

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800
 teaching,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 those are supposed to, because those are called "poor visions" at the minute we know.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.800
 The first one is vision, or the realization of the seeing true nature, exactly as it is.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.800
 And the second is expanding the realization. Third is reaching to the peak of the awareness.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.800
 Here I mentioned here, peak of the awareness, or I translated peak of peak, but reaching to that.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.800
 And the fourth is, then, realization is completely reached to the dharmakaya status.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.800
 Those are the poor realization status, those mentioned in this and that.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.800
 And so when you have that realization, that moment, that time, finally,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 then collapses of those that will come. But in order to come, in order to boost that realization,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.800
 then here, mentioned here, is all this following, this bad eating, explaining,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:13.800
 mentioning that, really, and what has it, will you lie there, your three doors as three vegetables,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 and then continue from there, one, two, three, four lines, lines here, here,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.800
 and make the supreme offering of your daily trade, your body.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:35.920
 Imagine, to boost the realization, to bring the realization of this, like, to those poor stage of

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.800
 the realization of the looking,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 then you should do this, this following practices.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.800
 This is what is in the teaching mentioned, and of course, you know, you, it is.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.800
 You practices, you, you, I'm sure you heard that from the knowledge, you.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 You mean, again, it's available, what means, cutting thoroughly ego, ego.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:10.800
 There is two ego, when yesterday, or two days ago, two ego, cutting thoroughly ego, both ego.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 Both is to cut the ego of our self, and then second, cut of the ego, ego of the phenomenon.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 To cut that poor and that ego, it's called, also, two practices.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.800
 In the Tibetan, it's very popular and powerful, very practical.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 Two practices, it started from Gurba Masambhama, a great Indian monster known as Pata Masangi,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.800
 and then, as well as from the great master, task-level master, Marbha,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.800
 and then also from the great Muslim Rakhini, Rakhini, Māti-glāpādhi-dronma.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 I'm sure you heard that, Māti-glāpādhi-dronma.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 It's very famous, really, you're winning, or the Pīmā, Pīmā, realization,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 means Dara, or the Dara, and the Ishin-sodhiā.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.800
 Already, Vārahi, and the Ishin-sodhiā, and all come in a human form.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.800
 Again, it's all known as Māti-glāpādhi.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 So famous, and she met so popular of these two practices,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 and gave the teaching, particularly two practices.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800
 This is normal.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800
 And then, in the Gurba Masambhama, we teach, as I said,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.800
 and because of that, also, so many Dettungs had two teachings.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.800
 All those great Dettungs had two teachings, and you all know that.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.800
 And these two practices, in Tibetan, generally, there are two practices,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.800
 the Mahamudra practices, and the Dokshin practices,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 Madhivaka practices, Pandyaparama, the Awuma,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800
 middle-year practices, in the teachings, those Gurba Masambhama,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.800
 they're all the same, different names, and they're slightly different techniques,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.800
 and it's just that, really, the nature is the same.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 So therefore, it's not something completely different.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 It's all, basically, the same in the teachings mentioned in that.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 But this time, he has said to boost up the realization,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.800
 and then do the two practices, if you can do that.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.800
 In order to do this, then you visit, again, of course, these big teachings.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 And then, of course, Dhunu Numba is one of the few master's,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 and Dhunu Numba's teachings of the two meditation practices,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.800
 called Tumma practices, of course, the Awuma.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 Very famous, a very popular practice, a very powerful practice, and so that.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 And he also mentioned it to boost the realization of the Dokshin practices,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:50.800
 or the Shire Dhul Numba practices, and do these two practices.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.800
 In order to do this, this, then here,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.800
 over this, so, would you like your three doors?

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800
 That's three way there is this.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.800
 So, that you follow it, when you do the practice,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 you follow it, Sanha, that you receive, Sanha.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.800
 Sanha is Sanskrit word, and of course, we all know, Sanha.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 Sanha practice, Viki.
