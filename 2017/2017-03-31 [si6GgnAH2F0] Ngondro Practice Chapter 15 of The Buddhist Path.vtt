NOTE     "description": "\"Ngondro Practice\"\nChapter 15 of The Buddhist Path by the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches\n\nMain Topics Being Discussed \n \n1. \"The Ngondro practices are the preliminary practices of the Vajrayana. The usual approach in Tibet is to start formal practice with Ngondro, and while doing Ngondro you also do Shamatha and Vipashyana as part of Ngondro. In all Vajrayana practices, after the main part of the practice, there is a concluding section of Shamatha and Vipashyana. These are done according to the type of meditation you are doing, the instructions of your teacher, and your level of accomplishment.\n Previous great masters like Guru Padmasambhava extracted the essential teachings of the sutras and tantras and condensed them into the Ngondro. Ngondro is a compound word in Tibetan, made up of ngon, which means \"before,\" and dro, which means \"to go.\" Together they mean \"that which goes before\" or \"preliminary.\" Looking at the meaning in a larger way, the Ngondro practices \"go before\" because they must be done before reaching enlightenment. If these practices go first, then enlightenment will follow. Many people translate Ngondro as \"preliminary\" because these are the first set of Vajrayana practices. Ngondro is used to establish a firm foundation for further realization.\" (pg 77, 1st and 2nd paragraphs)\n\n2. \"The stability of Shamatha and the higher seeing of Vipashyana are also part of the Vajrayana visualization practices. When you visualize Guru Padmasambhava and concentrate on his image, that is a form of Shamatha meditation. At the end of the session, when you dissolve the image of Padmasambhava and meditate on the emptiness nature, that is a form of Vipashyana practice. Since guru yoga includes the practice of pure perception and the recognition of primordial wisdom, it is more extensive than Shamatha or Vipashyana. The discovery of pure perception, free from clinging and duality, comes from seeing Guru Padmasambhava's wisdom light reflecting in all directions. Guru yoga practice makes it possible to discover and experience everything as a radiant display of primordial wisdom.\" (pg 78, last paragraph)\n\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nVajrayana [Skt.; Tib. rdo rje'i theg pa]. The Vajrayana is also known as \"Tantra,\" the \"Adamantine Vehicle,\" \"Indestructible Vehicle,\" \"Secret Mantrayana\" [gsang ngags kyi theg pa; Skt. guhyamantra], and \"Mantrayana.\" The latter two names indicate that mind is protected from dualistic conceptions through the practice of this vehicle. From the Nyingma perspective, this comprises the three Inner Tantras and three Outer Tantras. There are two very important foundational elements to all Vajrayana practice: (1) a vast and sincere motivation of bodhichitta, which is the strong wish to bring all sentient beings, without partiality, to the state of complete enlightenment; and (2) a purity understanding or view of the nature, which regards all phenomena\u2014including one's own aggregates\u2014as the pervasive wisdom display of the \"three vajra states\" [rdo rje gsum], the inseparable union of wisdom and compassion.

Among the \"Three Roots\" of Vajrayana practice, the guru is the source of blessings. It is often said that one's guru is even kinder than the Buddha, since he or she directly bestows the empowerments, transmissions, and lineage instructions that lead to enlightenment. Guru Yoga is among the most profound techniques of the Secret Mantra, in which a practitioner merges his or her mind with the wisdom mind of the guru.

With this foundation, we practice additional Dzogchen meditation techniques according to a more elaborate scholarly way, or in a simpler yogi or yogini style.\n\nKhenpo Rinpoche gave this teaching during the Richo Mountain Retreat at Padma Samye Ling on April 5, 2011.\n\n\nTo download the pdf of all the Main Topics, Concepts, and PBC YouTube Videos to refer to for this PBC Morning Dawn Study Webcast, go to the main \"Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\" Facebook page: www.padmasambhava.org/facebook\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hello and welcome to the 15th webcast from Padmasami Ling. This is a PBC morning dawn study group,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 and today we'll be talking about the Venerable Khevelopo Che's book, the Buddhist Path, Chapter 15,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.210
 and it's called Ngondro Practice. So thanks a lot for joining. We'll begin with our usual opening

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.000
 prayers,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 and then we'll go into the discussion. So thank you very much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 [Singing]

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 In the palace of the old man Dhammadattu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 the one who shows clearly the Dhammakaya of my own mind, we praise to the honorable Vrutkuru,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 the glorious Vrut teacher, precious one, dwelling on the lotus seat on the crown of my head.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Hold me with your great kindness and bestow the accomplishments of bodhi's speech and mind.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 [Singing]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 [Singing]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Thanks. So we'll begin in the Buddhist Path, Chapter 15, and Ngondro Practice, which is on page 77,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and then I'll briefly just summarize the first half of the chapter, which is really short,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 and then we'll go into our main topics we're discussing today.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So the first paragraph of the Venerable Kemperomache says that the Ngondro, or the foundational

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 practices,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 are the preliminary practices of the Vatrayana.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.460
 Great masters like Guru Padmasambhava extracted these essential teachings of the Sutras and the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.000
 Tantras

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 and condensed them into the Ngondro, these practices that we're going to discuss.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 The Ngondro means that which goes before. So looking at this meaning in a larger way,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 the Ngondro practices go before because they must be done before we complete enlightenment,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 before we become enlightened.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 The Ngondro itself has several parts.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 The first section Rinpoche has discussed is the first thoughts that turn the mind away from samsara

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 and towards nirvana or enlightenment, and these include the four points.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 The first is our preciousness of our current situation.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 The second is impermanence of all conditioned existence.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Third is the infallibility of cause and effect, or karma.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And fourth is the futility and the dissatisfaction of doing negative actions

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 and the inevitable experience of negative results from those actions, so samsara.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.250
 Then the second section of Ngondro practice is taking refuge in the three jewels of the Buddha

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.000
 Dharma and Sangha

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.270
 and the three roots of Guru Deva and Dakini in the Vatrayana level of the Buddha Shakyamuni's

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.000
 teachings.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Then the third section of Ngondro is developing bodhichitta,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 which is caring more for others than for one's own self,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 and wishing and working to help all beings become enlightened by oneself becoming enlightened.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Then the fourth section is called mandala offering,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 which is a principle practice to accumulate a vast amount of merit and wisdom.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.990
 And then fifthly is the Vajrasattva practice to purify our negative actions and the obscurations of

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.000
 our mind.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Then the sixth section is the guru yoga practice,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 which Rinpoche says is exceptionally important to receive the blessings of the guru

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 and all the lineage masters and gurus and bodhisattvas,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 and then mingling their wisdom and separately with our own awareness.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So these are the six main sections of any Ngondro practice.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.560
 And then the Rinpoche's then go on to say that an important part of Ngondro practice is prostr

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.000
ations,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.500
 which particularly are aimed at removing obscurations of our body and releasing the knots in our

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.000
 channels.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And they say that you can do prostrations traditionally while reciting the refuge prayers

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 or while saying this Bhajra Guru mantra of Guru Padmasambhava in the guru yoga section.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Yeah, people will go, that's more or less the first section of the chapter,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 then maybe Lodra if you read that first main point and discuss.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Oh sure. So on page 77, the first paragraph reads,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 "The Ngondro practices are the preliminary practices of the Vajrayana.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 The usual approach in Tibet is to start formal practice with Ngondro,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 and while doing Ngondro, you also do Sanatana Vipashana as part of Ngondro.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 In all Vajrayana practices, after the main part of the practice,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 there is a concluding section of Shammatam Vipashana.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 These are done according to the type of meditation you are doing,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 instructions of your teacher, and your level of accomplishment.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Previous great masters like Guru Padmasambhava extracted the essential teachings

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 of the sutras and tantras and condensed them into the Ngondro.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 The Ngondro is a compound word in Tibetan made up of none, which means before,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 and dro, which means to go. Together they mean that which goes before, or preliminary.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Looking at the meaning in a larger way, the Ngondro practices go before

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 because they must be done before reaching enlightenment.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 If these practices go first, then enlightenment will follow.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.750
 Many people translate Ngondro as preliminary because these are the first set of Vajrayana practices

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.000
.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Ngondro is used to establish a firm foundation for further realization.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Well, if I may, after you're lively reading Ngondro, thank you.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Oh, thank you.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 What strikes me most there, personally, is the whole concept of it going before.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Other people here know more about Chamathana, the text of meditation.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 But I was just thinking that what's rich about it, I suppose,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 is that you're meditating and practicing meditation as a beginner, as we all are,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 but that it's something that opens the path and kind of opening a space

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 so you're actually heading in a direction with it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 You're not just sort of blankly directionless.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 It's something that's why I experience it.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 There's something sort of opening the path, like I feel helpers going out there

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 and opening space for me, so I'm actually going to go somewhere a bit different.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 It's not just going to be sitting here with me in a blank, or kind of in the same place.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 That's what strikes me.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 But also what also strikes me is that the text says that the Tibetan masters condensed them in Ng

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.000
ondro.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 What is it? All the sutras and all the... - All the sutras. - And all the tantras.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So that's a lot. That's a lot.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 More than I'll ever have a chance to touch, so I'm very glad someone condensed it for me.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Really, like, honestly, seriously.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 We just received a lot of some teachings here.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 We were very lucky from Rupuche, from Kampur Rupuche.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.600
 I'm very grateful for them. He was very kind. He taught a lot about Ngondro and the rest of the

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.000
 teachings.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And some of the sections struck me particularly, you know, as perhaps parts of condensed sections

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 that I hadn't gotten before. I was like, "Oh, that's me, the Ngondro."

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And I was wondering, just personally, if you want to answer personally,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 what struck you in those teachings and what struck you most about Ngondro,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 the teachings we all just shared in the last month?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.730
 It seems like they keep... Kimbo, at least, he keeps going back to Ngondro being something you just

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.000
 keep doing.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And it's interesting that they even explicitly... I mean, it makes sense.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 They would say that it is preliminary, but at the same time, it's just...

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Kimbo keeps saying also how it's not just preliminary.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 It's a preserve, or it's like the stabilizer of everything else we do, it seems like.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 I know he talks about it being the launch path, you know?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Oh, yeah, that's a nice thing.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 It's kind of like the second paragraph, that last sentence of both those first paragraphs

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 in a way seems related to what you're talking about.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.970
 The end of the last paragraph is just saying how Ngondro is establishing a firm foundation for our

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.000
 realization.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 And then that last sentence in the first paragraph is saying that Ngondro is done

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.860
 according to the type of meditation you're doing, the instructions of your teacher and the level of

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.000
 accomplishment.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 So in a way, when I was reading, especially that line, it really kind of in a way...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 it alludes to that part of Ngondro, how it really is... it is the complete path.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 There's nothing missing in the Ngondro.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And that aspect, how it is... it's everything... the whole package is right there.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Because the more we spend our time familiarizing ourselves with all these aspects,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 then, you know, and the more we keep that with our joy and devotion and all those ingredients,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 then the deeper and deeper and more full the realization comes.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 And how it applies every single step of the path to Ngondro,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 it seems like those sentences kind of bring out that point.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 But Ngondro did what you were going to say.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Oh, you did? Oh, wow.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Oh, I was looking at... for those who have the study guide to it also,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 if you look down in the Vajrayana, one of the things that also struck me

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 was when I was looking through the foundational elements of Vajrayana practice,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 they talk about that vast sincere motivation of bodhicitta.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And of course, I mean, there's... Ngondro has the whole section of bodhicitta.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 But also, when it goes into that purity or understanding of the view, you know, the nature,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.440
 how much of that really comes out of not only the renunciations that really start to soften your

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.000
 heart

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 and soften your heart not only to, you know, being able to be more perceptive to the view,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.530
 but also soften your heart in that way you're able to be more perceptive and compassionate towards

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.000
 others.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.280
 So you have that essence. Then there's the refuge where you're really starting to sink down into

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.000
 that aspect,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 you know, into that softness and really, you know, have that trust and teaching.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And then it, you know, blends into bodhicitta where it's that vast compassion,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 that motivation that they're talking about, the foundation.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And then, again, when you start going into like the mandala and Vajrasattva,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 again, you know, you're purifying the view, you're accumulating that wisdom,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 you're really just clearing away all that clutter.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.770
 And then the guru yoga there, right there, you know, all of those blessings that really do just

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.000
 make that view.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 So maybe personal is not really the right word, but it does give it that very intimate, I don't

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 know,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 but that, you know, it's there. It's very tangible.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And then, you know, going into the Amitabha practice and the dedication,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 particularly the dedication of Arichu's too, it's easy to see there how, you know, just that,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 it touches back into that bodhicitta, again, that motivation for others, that giving away, you know

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.000
,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 we do all these beautiful practices and, you know, have that real tangible, beautiful, you know,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 qualities just kind of really glorify and pop. And then now it's like, okay, this isn't for me, you

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 know.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 So in that sense, it's really beautiful, how it's, I mean, you start to, the more you look at,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 the more you see the different ways that it is the foundation, you know, it's, you know,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 particularly the way they talk about preliminary and the way that it's not so much just before,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.160
 as much as preliminary to enlightenment. All practice is preliminary to enlightenment, you know, in

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.000
 that way.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 The third thing what you're saying is your sense of it being a whole that's really wonderfully tied

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 together,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.610
 and holding it so nicely and holding it up the whole thing together, but just quickly, in case it

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.000
 sparks anyone else,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 what I found listening this time is that there's a piece I hadn't been doing, the mandala offering.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.660
 Oh, with the father, I haven't got all the pieces together, whatever, you know, I can do this while

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.000
 I'm on the bus,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.590
 but I can't try this when I'm on the bus, etc., right? So I felt a little, but I haven't really sat

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.000
 with it much,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 I'm not going to stop for the rest much, but mandala specifically, I haven't done.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Listening to what Kemper was saying about it this time really settled something for me,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 and I just did it a little bit, you know, my hand walking around between teachings,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 and I was really surprised because, you know, it had a real effect on me.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.390
 Suddenly, the way he puts it is that it's offering up, or pulling together, opening the door of

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.000
 infinite luxuries,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 opening the door of infinite luxuries and offering them on different levels,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 you know, on the things that are, and on the level of one's own experience of those things,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.520
 and then on an even vaster level, and that can be read in many different ways, or experienced in

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.000
 different ways,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.600
 but I hadn't actually sat there and pulled all those things and offered them all together all at

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.000
 once,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.390
 and when I did, it sort of said, "Oh, I'm actually kind of right here, like it is, like I can fit

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.000
 all those things in,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 and it's all happening right here," and that made a big difference for me in how I experience,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 or anticipate experiencing, the rest of the mandala.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 So you're saying it's really a whole, it's all tied together, and that the pieces feed each other,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 really, you know, makes sense to me, even though, right now, I noticed that recently.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Wonderful!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Yeah, I'm sure other people got something specific, kind of.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 I mean, I got something like, kind of like what you guys were all saying,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 and what Dylan mentioned, that he said, "We keep doing it."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Yeah.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Like, we don't just do nothing to get through it, to get the accumulation,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 "I got five, I got five hundred thousand, I'm done," or, "Okay, I did..."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.190
 You know, of course, there's definitely that sense, like, "I have to do a hundred thousand

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.000
 frustrations."

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 It's just like, that's a number, you know?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 But if you don't do any of those with mindfulness, if you don't do any of those with awareness,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 or like Lai said, following the instructions, opening your hearts with a practice,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 understanding why you're doing it, really connecting with the lineage and with the teachings,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 while you're doing it, as much as you can.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Because otherwise, it's kind of like, "Who cares if you're doing Andro?"

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 You know, like, if you do it routine, without thinking about it, to get it done,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and you didn't transform your mind, and your heart didn't open anymore,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 it's just like, it's no big difference.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah, that's great.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 The point of all Dharma practices, transform the mind, you know how it patterns.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 I mean, I personally got a lot from his book, not about, not for happiness,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 and he really mentions that.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 He's like, oftentimes, you know, we wake up, go through the practice mechanically,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 don't really even think or connect with the aspiration of prayers,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 and he's like, "Our result is small," you know?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Because we don't, we're not doing the practice.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 I'm not saying it, we're not doing it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 But Rinpoche said, he's like, "Patra Rinpoche, he did Mundo 23 times, or 25 times, or 27 times."

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 "Sankhapa, during one retreat, he did 3,800,000 prostrations during one four-year retreat."

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 So it's like, and these are masters of the highest degree.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 I mean, nobody knew exactly what Patra Rinpoche's main practice was,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 but everybody thought it was Andro, because whenever they heard him,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 he was during Mundo practice, in the prayers and refuge, in Atisha,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 one of the greatest masters ever in Tibet.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 They called him, they said, after a while, someone said,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 "Oh, you had the refuge lama," and referred to him like that.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 He said, "Refuge lama? What's that? Oh, that's you!

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Everyone calls you refuge lama because you teach on refuge all the time, so much."

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 And he was like, "Oh, really? Oh, I'm so happy, you know? That's so wonderful."

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Because he felt so joyful. He was like, "If people connect with just the refuge,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 they're totally clear. All their path to enlightenment will be just totally clear."

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 So anyway, that heartfelt, you know, like, really connecting with it as much as we can.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Of course, moving along and keep going, not getting caught up in, but that's just...

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 It's not so rich because it's experiential.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Like, I'm just thinking of refuge.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 The first time, Lai, you were here when I... I think I probably said it to you.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 When I first did prostrations... I mean, I've never heard of anything like this before,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 but anyway, I was here, so I liked some prostrations.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 I was kind of amazed. I said, "Oh, my gosh!"

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 I said, "You know, I'm a girl, and, you know, I have a professional staff."

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 I said, "So I'm used to holding myself up, and, you know, make a trail look good,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 and, you know, whatever, all the time."

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Upright, right? You know, ready.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 And here I did. I sort of put myself on the floor, right?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 My face right in the floor, and I, like, I could get up again. I was okay.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 And it was just this feeling of, "Oh, that really felt kind of good to put myself down like that

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 and not have to worry about it and just, like, lie down."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And so there was this sense of, "Oh, wow, I can just put myself down,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 and, like, I'm going to survive. I'm not going to die.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 But I can just put myself down. I don't have to be holding myself up like this."

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So, and even, you know, beyond that, I'm now thinking that I think those movements,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 you know, you go down, and you have a certain prayer you sang with it,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 and depending on the level of the prayer and how the instructions you've received,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 it sinks in a different way.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 You're like this, and then you go down, and you're sang a certain line as you spread out,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 and you do this, and then you come up, sang another line, and all this is, you know,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 almost like doing sports. You do sports.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 The fact that you're kinesthetically doing something linked to a certain thought

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 or a certain line, you know, the thought, you have your sang a line,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 in fact, you link those pieces together, eventually it can start, "Whoa, I kind of got something

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 there.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 I think I'm on a path. I think I'm on a track.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 I think it's opened and went before, opened away from me."

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Oh, wow, you know, you're linking sound and movement and lineage blessings

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 and the lines of the prayer and your brain.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 It's a body, speech, mind.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Working together to take you places, you didn't know you were going to go with that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah, you find a humility out of nowhere.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Different things, wherever you're meant to go on that path,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 it'll open it for you because you're just doing all this stuff together.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 You don't know how to make it.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 And someone goes, "Wow, okay, that's interesting."

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 That's why I think it's so personal, too.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Once we start doing it and we start with the real attention or really opening the heart,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 I just notice everyone I talk to, they have sort of like a slightly different way

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 of doing every practice as opposed to your own practice.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 I love that. It's like you really practice, you really open your heart.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 You're going to find more ways the more you open up.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 I don't know. It's just not that beautiful.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Yeah, go ahead and speak in sports.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Well, maybe in sports there's no prayer. That could be part of the problem.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Not as much prayer in sports, so we're losing the speech.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 But anyway, I was going to ask one quick question about how to say

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 that it must be done before reaching enlightenment.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Is that talking just specifically if you're going to follow a Vajrayana path to enlightenment?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Because obviously in Vajrayana, depending on our practices,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 you don't have a specific number of practices,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 although you could say that some of those moments are involved,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 but maybe not the same degree.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And as far as that also being a path to enlightenment, it doesn't include wonder.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Yeah.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 I was going to say, in Vajrayana, there's three key ingredients

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 that are essential for becoming enlightened.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And Rinpoche has said this many times in the Buddhist path.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 One, we have to remove all of our obscurations.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So all the habits we have, all the mistaken, less functional ways

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 of experiencing how things are. So purification.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Second, we have to reveal our goodness qualities.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Bring out these positive qualities that are naturally there,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 but perhaps hidden away to some degree.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And this is a lot related with accumulating merit,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 or accumulating a positive energy, revealing our natural capacities that are there.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 So that's the second.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 So that's purifying obscurations, accumulating merit.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 And third is receiving the blessings of the wisdom lineage,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 like the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and all these enlightened beings,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 like through the auspicious connection and their kindness,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 receiving their blessings to help see the own inherent purity

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 and perfection of our own awareness,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 to inseparably blend with their wisdom mind.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 So that's the Guryoga part.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 But I think in terms of all the teachings of the Buddha

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 include, at least as two, purifying the obscurations

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 and revealing those innate goodness qualities

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 that every sentient being has.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And then thirdly, I think what makes Vajrayana specifically

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 more of a swift path is the blessing component,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 the Guryoga component, which directly connects us also

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 to seeing the inherent purity of things.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 It's called the pure relative truth,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 aspect which makes Vajrayana a more swift path

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 to actually fulfilling that enlightenment of ourself and others.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 So that's also, those are the essential points of Sutra and Tantra,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 like those three points.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And then more elaborately in Namtro, it has those same points.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And there's also, you know, of course,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 it's kind of just reaffirming what we've heard again and again

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 and need to know if we don't.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 But just how Vajrayana Buddhism is based on Mahayana,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 which is based on Hinayana,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 like it's not a completely separate system.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 They're all integrated and rely on each other as a whole system.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 So this is Tibetan Buddhism, is Vajrayana Buddhism,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 but that doesn't mean it's somehow separate from all the rest of the Buddhist teachings.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 In fact, it's like the whole package, all of the Buddhist teachings,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 which are based on Mahayana and Hinayana.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 And like, you know, Rinpoche said in this beautiful, you know,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 retreat we just completed as well as so many other times,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 how even within the Namtro, you know, the four thoughts,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 you know, how that kind of relates to the Four Noble Truths,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 which is the whole path, and then as well as then also, you know,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 like refuge, of course, entails everything

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 when we're looking, coming from the perspective,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 but it's especially maybe more on the foundational Buddhism or Hinayana Buddhism

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 and then expanding that through the Bodhichitta, you know,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 which is, again, all these refuges, the gateway to all Buddhist practice,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 you know, reflecting on qualities and, you know,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 moving towards these beautiful qualities and abilities

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 and powers of the Three Jewels, you know,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 and away from what's, you know, causing us problems

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 and towards something reliable.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And then that's this whole vast realm of practice, you know,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 until we all end all beings.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And then moving forward, expanding that vision and scope and realization

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 and the food of the practice in the Bodhichitta meditation,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 which again, that's so vital, heart, essence, you know,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 and then the skillful means, you know, and accumulation of merit and wisdom,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 I mean, particularly in the way that mandala practice is a really catalytic process of that.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 But of course, all of our practice involves accumulating merit and wisdom

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 and then the purifying, like, you know,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Dhamma was mentioning with Alandrasattva

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 and then it's mingling our mind with the mind of the guru,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 which is essentially, again, you know, this is called the Buddhist path,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 but again, the real name of this book is also opening to our primordial nature,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 which is the Buddhist path.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So in that sense of how the guru yoga,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 that devotional aspect and receiving the blessings is.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 The Bodhichitta is so vital too.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 And the other way it goes before is it maybe prepares you for,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 I mean, the Bodhichitta wishing well to others in practice and that, even in words,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 is almost, at least it goes for me,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 almost a preparation for the times when I would almost be called upon to prove

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 that I could do some of that, you know, in a little way.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 I mean, just, I'm speaking of multiple progress I've made,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and those times I've sort of had to do something to show that I could respect,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 you know, that sort of Bodhichitta intention were key points really for me

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 in being able to progress in a little bit in this sort of whole path.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 So in a sense, in that way it went before me as well.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 I might not have said those words and thought about it.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 I would never have done the things like that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 And the way I did it, and I kind of did it the way I did it because,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 "Oh, well, the lineage wants me, I said I would do it.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 The lineage wants me to do it."

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 I sort of did it blindly, and then it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 But having actually done even a little thing,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 it really was key to the Guryoka all the way up to make enormous differences

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 along the whole thing.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 So it's really clear to me how important these are.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 They've only been in Mi'kmaq tradition. They really are together.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So strong. So strong.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Should we move? I think we only have about 10 minutes.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Yeah, we do.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Do you want me to read the second point?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 I'll do the summary real quick first, and then that can be great.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Sure, sure.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So it's a quick summary. It's just the last two paragraphs of the chapter.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 This is page 78, I think.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 The first begins, "At the end of every Nandara session,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 you should dedicate the merit and the positive energy of the practice

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 to remove the suffering of all beings

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 and also that all beings will attain the perfect happiness of enlightenment.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And then also during every Nandara session,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 you should meditate on the true nature of mind

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 by releasing all grasping.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 In this formless meditation, an absolute truth

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 should definitely be done after vajra safa and guru yoga practices

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 if you don't have time to do it after each of the other components of the Nandara."

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Then the final paragraph, Rinpoche, concludes saying that

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 "Shyamata concentration practice and Vipassana insight practice

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 are always part of Vajrayana visualization practice."

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And the quote is going to go over this more.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 "Concentrating on the visualization while recognizing its empty nature

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 and the emptiness nature of your own mind

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 is the union of Shyamata and Vipassana.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And since guru yoga also includes the practice of pure perception

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 and the recognition of the primordial wisdom of one's own mind

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 and of all experiences,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 it is more extensive than Shyamata and Vipassana."

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 This guru yoga practice includes Shyamata and Vipassana

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 and then adds that pure perception of the Vajrayana component as well.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 On page 78 of the last paragraph, it says

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 "The stability of Shyamata and a higher seeing of Vipassana

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 are also part of the Vajrayana visualization practices.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 When you visualize guru Vipassana Sambhava and concentrate on his image,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 that is a form of Shyamata meditation.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 At the end of the session, when you dissolve the image of Vipassana Sambhava

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 and meditate on the emptiness nature, that is a form of Vipassana practice.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Since guru yoga includes the practice of pure perception

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 and the recognition of primordial wisdom,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 it is more extensive than Shyamata or Vipassana.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 The discovery of pure perception, free from clinging and duality,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 comes from seeing guru Padmasambhava's wisdom line,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 reflecting in all directions.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Guru yoga practice makes it possible

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 to discover and experience everything as a radiant display of primordial wisdom."

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So, wow, that's beautiful, that's beautiful.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Which I guess, I mean, just from this,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 that really seems like a reason why I know Kimbo,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 lots of times we're doing accumulations.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 He refers to guru yogas doing it first.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Sometimes I don't know if that's always, but...

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 He said that's how Kenshin Palanir which he always taught him.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Wow, wow.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Oh, right, beginning by doing a certain number

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 to really get that guru yoga part settled.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Yeah, yeah, restoring the accumulations.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Yeah, but, yeah, it just seems so beautiful.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I mean, so, that's very, wow.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Yeah, I have to find something.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Just got something there, thanks.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 I'm sure you're inducing that.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Yeah, I know, I might have to read it again.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 So, Chakra, is that kind of like how you were saying before

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 that you can use the guru yoga part

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 to identify with the Vajrayana view

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 and bring that as a swift path

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 because you can identify with the instead of maybe the Hinayana,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 which often focuses maybe a little bit more on relative truth as being suffering

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and then identifying instead of like the the kind of already enlightened view.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 It's, you know, already, it's your pure perception of primordial wisdom is displayed.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Maybe that's part of what you're saying, like why it's a swift or path

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 because you have that aspect that you can concentrate on from the beginning

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 where they bring in your practice from that perspective.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 You can, that's saturating practice from the beginning.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Yeah, I think, I mean, definitely the Kemperumiches say that.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And I mean, even in the final line,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 it says, "Guru yoga practice makes it possible to discover and experience

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 something as a radiant display of primordial wisdom."

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 So according to the lineage of Mipham Rinpoche

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 and then of course Venerable Kemperumiches,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 who very closely follow that lineage,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 that one of the essential points of the third turning of Buddha,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 like Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching, is this pure relative truth.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 We all have this Buddha nature, this primordial nature,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 and that when we see that nature first

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 and then express from that recognition,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 we're seeing forms and sounds as being the display of that Buddha nature

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 that's called pure perception or devotion,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 which is more or less a distinctive feature of Vajrayana practice in that way.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 All the Buddhist teachings include devotion and seeing the goodness.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 But Vajrayana specifically recognizes that that's an inherent quality

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 of the nature of all sentient beings' minds.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 And then it utilizes different meditation techniques

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 to engage one's body, one's speech, one's mind,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 to recognize the purity of each of those three aspects

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 with a practice when comprehensively bringing them all together

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 at once in a single meditation practice or in a single instant.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 And that's part of the swiftness of the Vajrayana.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 So it goes to that pure relative truth.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And then the guru yoga also reveals the absolute truth,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 the pure, stainless, non-conceptual wisdom nature of one's own mind.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And that's all experiences, so you have pure relative truth

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 and inseparable with absolute truth.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And then you have the full Vajrayana view.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Or you could say the same way at the union of shaamata or vipassana

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 and the complete teachings of the Buddha Shabhmani Guru.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 I think that's it.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It ties into a little bit of what we were talking before too

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 about how it's the shaamata and the vipassana are in all of these parts,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 particularly if you actually have that time to do it in between each session,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 but even what we were saying before, you know,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 there's that you do the same meditation after the vajrasatva,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 you do it after the guru yoga for a very good reason,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 because it's like, "Okay, wake up!"

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 That's what you're doing this for, come on.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 We have to become familiar and comfortable

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 with both the form aspect and the formless aspect.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 If we only are comfortable when things are moving and expressive and active,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 then we can get good at that, and we need to.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 But if we tend to push away the quieter, being still, formless aspect,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 then that's a problem, because the form and the formless are inseparable.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 We have the relative and the absolute, or that's the teachings.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 At the same time, if we only want to sit there and peacefully abide

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 and not have anything disturb us and have everything be quiet

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 and feel good and kind of zone out and all that,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 this blank emptiness, then that's definitely not the teaching of the Buddha.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 I mean, we need to see the emptiness, the flexibility of the nature,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 and it flexibly arises as expression, and that can be like impure expressions,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 like if we're seeing things through duality or impure expressions,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 if we're not beginning with duality, but more connecting to our Buddha nature first.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 But that's inner, I mean, we need to.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 I mean, that's like the beauty of the creation and completion stages,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 or of Shyamantan Vipashana, it tries to seamlessly, like waves,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 like it arises as expression and dissolves into expressionlessness

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 and feel flexible with that.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Some of the things that we're saying that Nondra gives you Shyamantan Vipashana,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 but there's a third element, the Nondra, the lineage, the blessings,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 you know, or the light, the sort of, whatever it is,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 that if you sit and just do Shyamantana and Vipashana,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 you're not necessarily going to find, just sitting with yourself, something.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 So it's really saying that something, it's going to take you somewhere towards something.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 There's a third element there, you're doing Shyamantan Vipashana,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 but there's something else that's guaranteeing sort of a level of that,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 or a brightness of it, or a light in it, or this, the Nondra itself, you know,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Nondra itself as a lineage teaching.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 It's the extra piece, you've got three pieces, not just Shyamantan Vipashana, which are wonderful.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Which are very wonderful, I mean that's the essential teaching to the Sutra Mahayana,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 so bodhicitta done with Shyamantan Vipashana.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Definitely taught at least in full enlightenment, unsurpassable enlightenment,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 but it takes three countless eons.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 So then adding in that extra part of the pure perception, or the devotion component,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 or mingling with the wisdom blessings of the lineage,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 and seeing one's own nature that way too.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 It goes from instead of going out with a crusty dualistic mind,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 and like whittling away and revealing the inner good Buddha nature,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 it goes right into the Buddha nature with the guru yoga of blessings,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 and then have the goodness reveal from that, like it's already fully accomplished,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 and then to more and more flexibly see that.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 It goes before you, like a good attendant that will get you further along.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Which I think is why Guru Yoga is taught to our mind number, which is first.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 If he gets Padmasabhava, he embodies that.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 You know, I know I'm talking to Trump on Crazy Wisdom, he talks about that as far as,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 instead of going inside, from the outside, coming outside from the inside.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 It's like Padmasabhava, he was born enlightened.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 I don't know, I thought of that in the end, so it just makes sense to have that devotion.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 He can show us, you know, for whatever it is in our heart.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 And like the Reliant, you know they say the Four Reliances sometimes too,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 but also they say in relation to the teacher, don't rely just on the form, rely on the teachings,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 and rely on the teacher's wisdom minds.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Otherwise you could get caught up in thinking that Padmasabhava

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 has a little vulture cap, and like this, and a kapvaga, and that's what Padmasabhava is, you know.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Which Rinpoche said that really strongly before.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 "Oh, you think this is Padmasabhava?"

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 They pointed to the picture of Padmasabhava in the gopa.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 "This is a symbol of Padmasabhava."

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Padmasabhava could be a peer as anything, especially the nature of your own mind.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 So the teacher, I think that's a good point too.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 The teacher is the Buddha appearing in human form.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Not just human, you know.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 And the Guru Yoga really helps us connect with that fact that it's not something,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 enlightenment is not outside of ourselves.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 It never will be, never was, never has been for anyone who attended.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 So through the blessings of that embodied enlightenment that we have,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 we're blessed with the example through our teachers who hold the teachings

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 and the realization, you know, the Dharma of realization.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Not just scripture, but also the realization.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And then we emerge with them.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 We see that our mind is the same as their mind, you know.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 And their blessings penetrate us.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And we no longer see the teacher as just external, you know,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 this person and from this culture, you know.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 So beautiful.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 So then you really see the teacher, not just as an ordinary form, you know.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 It's more of a wisdom-minded teacher, the more comfortable you are

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 just with the person, the teacher too.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 It all goes together.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 It's sort of more tender and more, you know,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 just sort of easy-going with the actual person.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 That's sort of what the teaching is about in Cheetah,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 with each other as well, you know.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 The more we've managed to get sort of easy-going and just like,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 it's comfortable with each other.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 I know you know a lot even though you're so quiet.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 [laughter]

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 The grace of your quietness.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 [laughter]

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 The more that too shows that somehow we also sort of have an access

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 to a more wisdom-minded, you know, that all those levels go together

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 and comfort with them all.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Being natural.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 A little bit.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Yeah, definitely. That's what we're doing.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 All of that?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Now we can get all of that.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Do the new drill.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 [laughter]

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 And again, like so many of the chapters, we really need to conclude now,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 but this is why it's only two pages, but this is so rich.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Like even we just kind of scratched the surface.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Of course, and again, that's what's so beautiful about all these teachings

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 is we reflect on them again and again and again and again.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 It's really not the final word until we've practiced and absorbed and realized.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 But maybe we'll just dedicate the merit for now.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Let me just sit for a moment.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 [singing]

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 [singing]

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 By this merit, may all obtain omissions.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 May it defeat the enemy wrongdoing.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 From the stormy waves of earth all day, sickness and death.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 From the oceans of sorrow, may I free all beings.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 The precious bodhicitta, and those without it, may it be generated.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 And those who have it, may it never diminish, but always continue increasing.
