00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
 "If we handle right way, truly they become the supporter, supporter of our strength, and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.600
 supporter of our practice, meditation, and manual, manual, definitely become every other.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.800
 That means we should have the courage and confidence and joy and appreciation.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
 We have that strong as we keep this.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:42.920
 Then they become really manual, they become in a way support, because generally when we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.720
 go through, for example, in samsara level, we like to become champion, champion is not

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.000
 just become champion laying out on the bed, sitting on the couch.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.920
 You are engaging in the world and going on the way over there to the gym, and you see

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 how much they are doing.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 They are going to all the bands and acts and begin a time, but that really make them champion,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.080
 champion.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.480
 And then, for example, all our great masters and teachers, when you read these life stories,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.320
 they went many times difficultly troubles, so many times.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.480
 Mostly really those great teachers, great teachers, they are not just born with great

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.400
 teachers, they are not just came as great teachers.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.800
 They came as regular beings, a lot of difficultly troubles, but their courage and commitment

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.880
 and confidence cut so strongly, then they overcome that all those troubles become the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.200
 support to make them this great teacher.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 And therefore, great master, Long Jin Ba said, in the teaching, said, "I become as what

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 he is, become what is because of the harsh that I want, too.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 Therefore, I am thankful to the harsh.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:32.200
 And what I've become now, again, I went through so much obstacles, thankful to all those obstacles

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400
 that what they've made me now, what it is.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.320
 And because of all the samsara troubles, now I'm fully standing, stone in the Dharma.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 Therefore, thank you all the samsara troubles."

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 That's what really is said.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.880
 "Sering in the tune of the Talanayana, Donganayana, Muhminan of the Kanthi," said, "I dedicate

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.960
 all this made to all those obstacles so that we all get the same, this realization.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.040
 This is really what we stand with this.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 Definitely it is."

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.520
 Then this is more general way of talking.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.240
 And then in Vaidyanana teaching, the Skirble means in the Vistas, "Vistas, when you combine

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.560
 to get that, then what is obstacle?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.660
 What is the trouble?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.640
 We should not become too sensitive.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.440
 Of course we should sensitive, but we should not stand with that sensitive and that bearish

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 in that.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.640
 All these difficult troubles, nature is what?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 In the Vaidyanana teaching, it's emptiness.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.800
 It's really empty.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.440
 There is no substantial, solid existence, anything.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.800
 It is emptiness.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.920
 It is appearance and emptiness.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520
 It is just that.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 And we're not going toâ€¦

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.760
 I'm not going to hold onto that.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.160
 And applying all the other troubles of the teachings, applying, then it really becomes

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.760
 the manual, manual.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.600
 And manual, when you know this, what the Buddha used this example.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.400
 It's not just Ami used then.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.440
 The Buddha used the example, this manual, because manual, manual, manual, what it is?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.360
 But manual itself is very smelly, you know?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.800
 It's smelly, it's not very good.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 But if we use that nicely, what it does?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 Really.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.360
 And therefore, even though emotion is is, that what Buddha used in Samadhi Raj Sutras,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:45.640
 he said, this manual is helping to grow the sugarcane Buddha used, sugarcane.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 Similarly, emotions, negative emotions will help to grow the bodhicata, bodhicata.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:03.360
 Therefore, it is good, so this is all how we take care, how we handle it.
