NOTE     "description": "On April 15, 2010, while teaching on the life story of Guru Padmasambhava, the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches told stories about Tso Pema where Guru Rinpoche was captured by the King of Sahor to be burned alive, but he transformed the fire into a lake and inspired everyone in the kingdom to follow the Dharma. Here, they begin by talking about a small island of hollow reeds that floats on the surface of Tso Pema lake, and continue talking about the customs of local tribes and their father Lama Chimed's offering to the lake.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
 "So this small island, that's 6 to 7 feet. It depends on how much. Sometimes the wind takes that

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.930
 weight to the edge, and then it just stops there, but then again the wind kind of picks another one

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:27.280
 occasionally, and then it goes. Everyone says this is the representation of that lotus stop. It is

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.200
 nice.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:36.380
 And particularly it's true in the story. It's a true story because not so often there are famous, I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.300
 mean not famous, renowned Walees. Walees are called Kasha Walees. Kasha is one of the, again, Wale

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.760
es, there are so many inhabitants. Kasha Walees, and then Puti Walees, Thikarwala, Sankarwala, Sank

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.120
arwala. Kasha, Puti, Sankarwala, there are three tribes.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:09.370
 The ancient part of Tibet, even after that, but now it's part of India. Anyway, these women, they

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:18.630
 have different dress, they have different customs. They say that Kasha, women's dress, they said K

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.800
asha is dress of Dakini's dress.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:34.540
 And I think Puti, Puti's dress of women's is like peacock dress, peacock systems. I think Puti or S

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.730
ankar, and then Sankar has something, I'd poke it, but it's true, Kasha's dress is a different dress

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.900
 than what we see in the Thangas, the Dakini dress was like the Thangas, but the Dakini's were kind

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.800
 of like that.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.270
 And these Puti ladies wear these shoals, make so many layers, layers with their colors, and make

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.160
 these tassels behind when they move, this whole bunch of layers of clothes are moving back and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.800
 forth.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.050
 So this is like peacock, peacock custom. Anyway, this is really quite work now, that's what the A

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.800
ries says.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.540
 How about them? This Kasha is the land of Dakini, and Kasha has a very famous statue of also our

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.800
 location, very famous statue, and a southbound image.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.140
 So then Kasha has always the claims, they have the very special connection, Gurbel Masambha,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.800
 particularly all those women's, has very special connection, Gurbel Masambha.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 Because when Sahar came, burned Gurbel Masambha, and then he transformed the fire into the water,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 when he came out of that fire, Kasha, the lady, the one, the first offered him the food.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.000
 Food, so after the whole days, many days, he was, you know, in the day he had the food, they were

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 the one first offered ever since.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.450
 Then they had the very special one, like everybody's with these Kasha ladies, and then Kasha played

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.800
 Gurbel Masambha, those women come to play Gurbel Masambha, when they sang songs.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:36.260
 This is when they come to Sophyama, definitely this island will come to them, because they have the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.800
 special connection, they are the one first offered him the food.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.920
 So they, I think, they're stores, tradition, and we know that when this Kasha group comes, in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.700
 particular the women's are kind of old and talk, they really sing long times with flow, and they're

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.800
 singing songs with, I think, maybe Mataram verpema, some of Chaiti.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.650
 I don't know what I mean, but he's, I think, some other really times, you know, like that, that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.800
 really comes.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:26.220
 And we saw, when they joined, it really looks like they're coming, coming, the wind blows, twelve

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.740
 of them, and then they, they go to kata, kata, torokata, so this land, this small island has so

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.800
 many katas, they're all torokata.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:05:05.130
 And then our father also offered his wooden ball, ball that we carry, to bed, everybody has wooden

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.800
 ball.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 I mean, there's no carbon collectors, everybody carry their own balls.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 And then, in the Tibetan, their wooden balls are very, they make a lot of explanations.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 And this wooden ball, that wood, this wood, the quality of the wood is very, very expensive,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.800
 because they make a lot of explanations.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.980
 Actually, now these days, that the best wood, that's what they call the zap, harve, zap wood,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:39.780
 really, like, I mean, in the Buddha Gaya here, we heard, there sells over 300,000 rupees, one ball,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.800
 one wooden ball.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:50.300
 So in Tibetan, zap is the best. Zap is, even they say, in the, when you look today, the grains of

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.800
 the wood has gold, gold, they say, has gold.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:03.260
 In ancient thought, they say, zap full, you have, anybody give the poison, poison, that, that the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.800
 wood will crack.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 They say that too. We don't know. But it's really expensive now.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.270
 But the Buddha Gaya, there's so many marketers, in the wintertime, we can't admit in Korea this

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.800
 time, how much gold still there?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 This is over 300,000 rupees. You can't believe, really, that's it.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.700
 But father, I don't have that ball. But he has one nice ball, kind of like, he like, like very much

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.800
, and carried all the people to bed, I mean, that's his place.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.540
 So when he got in the Sope amount, and he filled that with grains, and now he's going to offer that

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.800
.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.800
 He's belonging to Gurbam or something.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:54.800
 And for grains, like food, and some fruit, I don't know, dry fruit, and all the filled with that.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.800
 And so I think one time that Arling is moving toward him, maybe not just for him,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.320
 but maybe it's just a move at that time. But anyway, at that time, with the Katha, he also offered

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.800
 that.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.350
 And he joined him in these seven chapters of praise, whatever that is, he also really offered that

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.800
 too.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 And so that's the story.
