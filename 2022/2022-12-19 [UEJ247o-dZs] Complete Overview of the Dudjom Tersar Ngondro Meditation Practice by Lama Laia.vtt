00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.680
 To begin, thank you. Welcome. In one voice, just reflecting on what our precious teachers

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.800
 again and again and again and again and again remind us that no matter what is happening

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:35.120
 in our lives, sorrow, happiness, boredom, joy, challenge, ease, always coming back to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.520
 our motivation is so vital and so important with an open, clear, honest, mindful attention

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.040
 to what we really hold dear and precious. Connecting with our motivation is so essential

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.960
 for our practice and our direction and our experience and our ability to benefit ourselves

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.160
 and others. So just in line with that, just from the very beginning, we'll just all take

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:22.120
 a few moments to just connect with our motivation and of course we have our three motivations

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:33.360
 as practitioners. We can always refer to our renunciation, our non-attachment that's equal

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.520
 with our joy and appreciation for our situation, all the freedoms and endowments and beautiful

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:54.080
 qualities surrounding us and within us. So our renunciation, our bodhicitta, really truly

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:04.340
 thinking of if we can all ourselves and all beings realize our true nature, be free of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:17.920
 all the causes of suffering, know true happiness, equally, expansively, impartially for all beings

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.440
 including ourselves and with great devotion just really and all and love and closeness

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:45.880
 feeling to the lineage, just savoring the sacredness of this very instant.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:26.800
 And so we'll just spend a little bit reflecting upon the teachings and the frameworks that

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:38.080
 we have for just like exploring this vast ocean of dharma which is what other than, again,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 our own basic nature and becoming more and more aware of that as well as all the ways

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.000
 in which we're creating disturbance and have wrong understanding of ourselves and others.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.520
 And the nundra practice is just renowned for being the essence, the distillation, the embodiment

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.320
 of all the Buddhist teachings and all the Buddhist practices. That's why our teachers

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.480
 just really encourage us to really connect with the nundra practices which literally

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:27.040
 mean that which has to be there in order to grow the ground we need to grow. And so it's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.600
 both the place that we grow from and it's also a container that we can land all of the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.120
 empowerments we might receive, transmissions and instructions, all the teachings from basic

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:51.360
 Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism, Dzogchen, they all have a place to land with

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:03.200
 our nundra practice. It goes both ways. A place for our study and practice to land and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.080
 sink deeper into our heart and then by applying the practice then again it breathes back out

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.240
 and we can absorb and engage with the Dharma more and more directly and see just and savor

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.960
 the richness of the profound Dharma. And then of course I thought maybe today since we're

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.480
 again starting up again just reflect a little bit of the framework through which we make

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:42.000
 our formal practice. Our formal practice is a place not necessarily to get away from the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.320
 world and abandon the world but it's a place to cultivate the vessel for really absorbing

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.080
 the teachings into our minds and hearts and cultivating them, giving a beautiful vessel

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.640
 container, a womb to really kind of touch home base and then bring that, expand that

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.040
 out into the world off of the cushion and in our days maintaining the atmosphere of

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.200
 the beautiful sacred Dharma of kindness and bodhicitta. All the Buddhist teachings again

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.880
 are in the nundra and what's another way we can relate to all the Buddhist teachings is

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.680
 what I know we've all heard but I think it's just helpful again to remember the three baskets,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.560
 the three treasuries, no matter what level of the Buddhist teachings are they all contain

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:50.280
 these three treasuries of basic activities, of basic teachings that embody all the Buddhist

00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:00.800
 teachings and those are the teachings on the Vinaya of Sutra of Abhidharma and then the

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.640
 trainings the way in which we engage with those teachings are what they're called these

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.600
 three precious trainings that again we engage with on every level of the path and throughout

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:27.920
 all the yanas which is the practice of right conduct, discipline is one, developing our

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:41.480
 concentration our ability to concentrate and not be distracted is two and then wisdom,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:49.600
 creating our wisdom which is the most essential part that's what we take refuge in right is

00:07:49.600 --> 00:08:00.160
 the omniscient wisdom of the Buddha and through that and that great unrelenting kind of compassion

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.200
 that just naturally pervading everywhere from that great mind of enlightenment and that

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:14.800
 deep wisdom and the skillful means to engage ourselves to connect with those practices

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.920
 which we do through study, through hearing, through thinking about the teachings and then

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:31.200
 of course absorbing them into our practice so then I thought to do again just briefly

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:44.600
 go over to what are good ways to hold our practice to maintain it and again relating

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:54.920
 on these very classical tried and true kind of guidelines so of course making time where

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:03.920
 every day we can have time to practice is really so good they can't can't be understated

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.040
 I think we all know from different experience how good that is when we can maintain but

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:21.440
 we need to be realistic with that and so looking at everything else we're doing in our days

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.760
 are other responsibilities and commitments really seeing where our commitment for our

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:38.570
 formal practice is and where we can most constantly maintain that is so important so having

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.000
 acquired

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 a part of the day a day we know we can reserve for our own practice no matter what that is

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.600
 let's say it's an hour you know be great if it's more but an hour is great and of course

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:57.960
 classically usually beginning of the day and or the end of the day are kind of perfect

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:04.080
 kind of border lines or crossroads between our inner and outer life that we can really

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:14.960
 again touch home base so whatever that is but having it be something attainable and

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:25.160
 then we have right what are called the three frames or three noble ones we want to always

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:35.000
 bring and kind of refer to with our practice and I think we've all heard what those are

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:45.920
 beginning middle and so just like we've done today we want to start good in the beginning

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.720
 but the real heart which means of our practice connecting with our bodhicitta our joy our

00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:00.760
 appreciation our devotion really connecting with those things setting up the good environment

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.600
 making offerings you know having a nice shrine to whatever degree of elaborate nature as

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:14.000
 an outer representation of the precious you know Buddha Dharma Sangha Guru Deva Dakini

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.920
 St. Dharmapalas the whole mandala of just totally realized nature unveiled in all of

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:32.720
 its glory shining compassion pervading for everyone however that is represented so of

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.640
 course intrinsic with that is keeping our own the lamp of our own heart open but again

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:47.040
 starting with our motivation and so then we usually do those things make a nice environment

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:57.840
 but not getting too fussy so we actually sit down and practice so relaxing more contentment

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:10.440
 appreciating taking time making the time we have for our practice allow us to really relax

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:17.400
 and just stop thinking even for a few minutes you know and then every engagement we are

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:26.120
 using is like with joy with appreciation with bodhicitta with joy for mindfulness and for

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:35.720
 accumulating you know positive actions that will create vast good results for all beings

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:44.160
 so really just starting simply with that good in the beginning which is also classically

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.760
 the four thoughts that turn the mind which will recite thinking again calling the lama

00:12:50.760 --> 00:13:00.280
 from afar whenever we think of the Buddha or any or Guru Padma Sambha as embodiment

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:07.840
 of all the Buddhas including our own living teacher of this life they're right there with

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:16.040
 us it's not so much that we're calling the lama from afar we're kind of waking ourselves

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:24.720
 up bringing ourselves out of our own kind of numb stupor to just like appreciate what's

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:35.160
 with us right now and feel the living presence of the omniscient guru as Padma Sambha embodiment

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:42.920
 of all the Buddhas of the three times and then reflecting on these four thoughts that

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:53.260
 turn the mind towards you know away from kind of unrealistic unreliable expectations such

00:13:53.260 --> 00:14:03.680
 as that things are permanent that nothing really matters as far as our actions you know that

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:13.520
 things are going to be forever and that we're independent call these kind of unrealistic

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:21.500
 ideas and kind of narrow you know just focusing on our own self in this one little life you

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:29.480
 know but kind of expanding our vision by reflecting on these four thoughts you know the precious

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.840
 precious human birth with all all the situations we're free of all the beautiful conditions

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:43.560
 that we're surrounded by and kind of have inherent in us and impermanence how everything

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:54.280
 is changing never for even in nanosecond remaining everything's always moving and just reflecting

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:04.440
 on the truth of that and looking at all those examples and then the natural cause of law

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:12.800
 the the natural law of cause and effect that every action has its effects when the causes

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:19.400
 meet conditions then the fruit will come and like we mentioned again what makes all the

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.800
 differences motivation and outlook you know but that you know everything is connected

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:38.940
 in all of our actions have their results and then reflecting on samsara this vast infinite

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:46.880
 disguise they're created by just not knowing how things are and then our hopes and fears

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.320
 related you know based upon that ignorance all the challenges of samsara from the most

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:04.280
 subtle anxieties to of course there can be such vast tragic kind of outer experiences

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:12.040
 so these four thoughts which turn again kind of soften our heart and mind bring us toward

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:25.760
 what's reliable the Buddha the Dharma the Sangha the omniscient mind of wisdom and its

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:32.960
 outreaching compassion and all the companions you know that help us to like nurture and

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:43.000
 ripen our own Buddha nature that then truly be of benefit to others taking refuge bodhicitta

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.240
 so now we've entered into the main part of our practice and again I think what we'll

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.440
 do is I'm going to go over these three frames briefly and then I think we're just going

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.760
 to go through the nundra and maybe it can make just little commentary as we go but again

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:08.040
 I'm not sure who's here but maybe some people are newer or even if we've all been practicing

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:15.400
 for years just kind of calling to mind some of the essential instructions and visualizations

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:24.340
 to like again usher our own heart and mind towards a direct benefit of the teachings

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:31.080
 that will naturally come when we put all these conditions together so we've moved from good

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:40.920
 in the beginning which is I you know again renunciation bodhicitta devotion purity view

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:50.900
 vision and then connecting with you know our deep trust and closeness feeling with the

00:17:50.900 --> 00:18:03.160
 Buddha Dharma Sangha and expanding you know our bodhicitta our mind our heart's commitment

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:10.040
 to both benefit ourselves and all beings through our practice and activate that through again

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.840
 these the four boundless the six paramitas which are again embodied within all of our

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:24.480
 nundra practice so then we've the main so in this section in this example of the three

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:34.520
 nobles we've good in the beginning maintaining that atmosphere of you know contentment joy

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:48.520
 appreciation bodhicitta purity vision as we take refuge generate bodhicitta accumulate

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:57.120
 merit with the mandala offering purify our obscurations with the vatrasattva practice

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:05.960
 and mingle our mind with the omniscient wisdom compassion abilities of the precious unsurpassable

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:18.440
 lama and then once we've finished up our main practice then of course the third frame which

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:29.920
 is always so essential is dedicating the merit it's like with our bodhicitta aspiration from

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:38.440
 now you know until samsara is empty you know or as vast as space there are infinite beings

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.960
 you know may may our wisdom and compassion be fully ripened swiftly and be of unceasing

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:53.520
 benefit for all those beings is our bodhicitta aspiration actualizing them with our study

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:04.760
 our contemplation our practice all the bodhisattva trainings you know is our path and then always

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.920
 so as part of that is always dedicating knowing the inevitability of causes and conditions

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:18.120
 of actions and their results you know which are totally driven and empowered more by our

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:25.380
 motivation we can always like the buddhist said dedicate the merit dedicate the positive

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:35.160
 results of our practice for all these infinite beings which means because the the nature

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:47.040
 of our mind the teachings say is infinite without any limits possibilities are endless

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.680
 the own nature of our mind is vast unimpeded that's why it's so important we really dedicate

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:02.880
 the merit and connect with our aspirations and like the buddhist said it's so famous

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:09.680
 if we dedicate the merit it's like adding a drop of water to the ocean it will be inexhaustible

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.320
 whereas if we kind of forget the benefits just evaporate quickly both for ourselves

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:24.840
 and for others but here we're recognizing that again with that really vast bodhicitta

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:37.720
 motivation as vast as space as infinite as space boundless infinite there are sentient

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:47.960
 beings and by this practice you know may may it's may it be the source of nurturing protecting

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:55.760
 and bringing benefit to all those infinite beings which means there is no end it is an

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:04.120
 infinite source of nurturing and protection and benefit for others so and then of course

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.060
 with them we can we have all of our other aspiration prayers and these great lineage

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:14.160
 prayers from totally realized practitioners we can connect with our mind and heart but

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:21.680
 we can also make our own aspirations and connect with our own intentions in the big big picture

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.800
 and even the small picture and then when we get up off our cushion then we're going to

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.520
 try to just the other part of our practice is being mindful of our current capacities

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.800
 and moving you know trying to reflect again with wisdom how everything is illusory and

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:50.280
 yet it's all connected so definitely being very careful or like Ken Po Seong-Worbice says

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:58.520
 timid with our conduct really acting keeping a big heart big open mind big view but then

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:06.920
 also very careful and mindful that we're acting in accordance with our present capacities

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:16.340
 and our present abilities and our present knowledge so that's all I'm going to say right

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.120
 now but then like I said I think as we go through the practice maybe we'll say a little

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:45.920
 bit more just reminders around how we're framing each section of the practice okay

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:51.240
 so we're going to have just again just thinking again in relation so much of our world has

00:23:51.240 --> 00:24:00.120
 the reified you know mandala of existence as the mechanical clock so with this sacred

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:07.600
 object we're going to make the vessel of our practice now be about an hour of course that's

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:14.560
 totally flexible if you have more time in the day great if you have left time that's

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.140
 fine too but like I said before thinking about becoming being familiar enough with the practice

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:27.960
 and here we're talking specifically of the the dudjum turso nundro practice that we kind

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.600
 of know how we flow through it and there's all kinds of choices of course we're blessed

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:43.720
 with that this has come to us through the living lineage of Tibetan Buddhism from these

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.120
 so precious so great and then this is in the Tibetan language the words of Guru Rinpoche

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:57.440
 and dudjum Rinpoche so we we can recite in Tibetan and then also so good most of us we're

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.840
 speaking in English so saying making sure we're connecting with the meaning as we're

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:12.120
 reciting too so I think we'll do a little bit of both today Tibetan and English but

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:19.320
 again the most important part while in our practice we have silent meditation wordless

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:26.440
 meditation even no meditation with no thought that's a nice idea something we definitely

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:34.000
 want to work towards we also have our chanting meditation and our analytical meditation we're

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.640
 examining reality and putting voice to our aspirations and giving expression to our bodhicitta

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:51.760
 and our you know our joy appreciation and devotion so connecting with the meaning as

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:58.520
 we're chanting and again thinking about these three trainings we're connecting with a good

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:07.480
 heart towards meaningful positive actions that will truly be of benefit for others and

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:14.960
 purifying our mistakes and misunderstandings and not aiming to never repeat them setting

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:22.240
 up really good conditions you know and engaging with them and then to then on this level of

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:31.480
 concentration really definitely says as part of when we begin doing some shamata again just

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:40.160
 taking a quick moment back wisdom is so important and then that's why I think definitely Buddha

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:49.620
 taught how seeing the law of cause and effect and conduct makes a difference it has its

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:57.840
 big influence and concentration developing concentration is so vital and important because

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:05.160
 we're so often just distracted and so easily distracted from even what's really important

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:15.760
 to us and deeply meaningful for us at times but then here and then bringing out our wisdom

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:22.200
 so definitely as spending a little time to do basic shamata at the beginning but also

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:30.360
 being gently mindful of keeping with our practice as we're going make just checking in like

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:38.920
 how much we're relaxed how much we're in an atmosphere not just a tight thought but an

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:58.320
 atmosphere of bodhicitta and appreciation and joy and flow with the practice we'll just

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:08.680
 spend a few moments just to use the shamata calm abiding good posture so our our channels

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:16.440
 are in nice alignment and our inner our winds are can flow and our mind can settle

00:28:38.680 --> 00:29:08.000
 in the Zoktion teachings there's these three

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.280
 beautiful thoughts that really I don't know for me at least they're so helpful in kind

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:24.960
 of setting the stage and recognizing the stage

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.720
 for all of our practice and it's called the three

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:39.680
 postures you know of body speech mind so again with good posture we're gonna this beautiful

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:49.560
 metaphors all of our senses are like clear crystal still lakes we're not trying to shut

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:59.180
 anything out but allowing all of the natural majesty of our body to be supported by the

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:06.840
 earth open to the sky you know with this seven-point posture of our achana kind of our three things

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:15.760
 we can check in with again that make it help ensure our channels are open and aligned which

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:23.200
 naturally makes our winds settle and move more to our central channel and I know so

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:42.680
 our mind settles and all of our senses are open not just our eyes but our ears our sense

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:54.200
 of smell our sense of taste all the sensations of our body like the Buddha said like you

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:08.280
 know dreams magical displays clouds do fire rings dreams you know such we should view

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:21.240
 all composite things so that state of openness and clarity just connecting with the doors

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:44.200
 of all our senses are open like still lakes

00:31:44.200 --> 00:32:14.160
 with a mountain like body uncontrived and then just totally sky like mind open into

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.720
 mind holding everything

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:54.900
 and when we rest with the big open mind and heart in this this is nothing but the mandala

00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:18.200
 of our precious guru the omniscient Buddha it's compassion and so then we'll begin again

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:26.880
 with this seven-line prayer and lineage prayers recognizing again not none of this is coming

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:33.080
 out of this random chance we all have this beautiful connection with the living lineage

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:41.440
 of wisdom compassion that's come to us through this living lineage all the way unbroken all

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:56.700
 the way to buddha shakimuni we'll recite the seven-line prayer and lineage prayers and

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:14.580
 then go to the calling the lama from afar

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:40.300
 to the lama from afar to the lama from afar to the lama from afar to the lama from afar.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:53.340
 And then we'll begin with the satsang.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:35:18.220
 The satsang is a little bit different from the satsang.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:46.380
 The satsang is a little bit different from the satsang but the satsang is a little bit

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.260

 arises the blessings of self liberation are obtained through fabricated practice there

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:09.620
 is no time to achieve enlightenment this meditation produced through mental analysis and intellect

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:17.280

 now welcome to the section of beginning the actual nundra practices which is the first

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:58.020
 the doorway to all the buddhist practice is taking refuge so again just with a mind and

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:06.980
 heart of joy devotion courage commitment reflecting on the qualities and the different meanings

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:13.380
 of the buddha dharma sangha all embodied as the lama

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:22.740
 so every outer inner secret level of kind of meaning that we can know reflecting on that

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:30.900
 and then the visualization is then you know before us is the refuge tree like growing out of

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:39.860
 onto this beautiful jewel encrusted lotus stem blooming in full bloom before us is a precious

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:48.420
 origin padmasambhava you know all so majestic shining smiling looking directly to our

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:58.100
 heart of hearts and with equally with all beings and then above gurampashe all the masters of the

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:08.180
 lineage you know from samantabhadra kind of showering down and then you know to the left and right

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:08.340
 of

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:17.860
 of guru padmasambhava all the buddhas of this fortunate aeon and all you know and all the

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:25.460
 buddhas and bodhisattvas on all the our hearts and eight great bodhisattvas and all the sanghas

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:32.900
 and behind you know all the self-reciting mounds of all the oceans of of the dharma text

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:42.420
 self-resounding and then all of the the deities and dakinis and dharma palas before and then

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:51.140
 we're standing just before that embodiment of gurampashe and all the the dharma and the true

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:58.180
 nature and then to our our right and left the mother and father of this life are with us

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:05.300
 and then before us all the infinite beings of samsara and then in one voice reflecting on the

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:15.610
 qualities of the buddha dharma sangha embodied as the lama and we take refuge until we are set

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:15.860
 again

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:22.740
 with that joy and confidence that by doing that we ourselves can be an object of refuge

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:32.100
 and truly be a benefit you know for ourselves mature our own minds free our own you know free

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:41.380
 ourselves from our our misunderstanding and find true peace and then through that being the source

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:48.420
 of the same for all the infinite beings but truly being able so we'll do you know holding

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:55.540
 that meditation and again with our body our speech and mind we're going to take revisit our refuge

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.660
 vow so we'll do that a few times just sitting and then we'll get up and then before about five

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:16.820
 minutes we'll all do prostrations before the shrine

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:30.180
 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:39.780
 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:51.780
 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:03.940
 and then again just everyone get up and in your own way we'll we'll do prostrations

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:17.460
 with the refuge prayer holding the meditation for about five minutes

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:53.460
 from now till attaining the heart of enlightenment i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:03.460
 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:35.460
 from

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:05.460
 now

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:35.460
 um

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:05.460
 um

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:35.460
 um

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:05.460
 um

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:35.460
 um

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:05.460
 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:19.460
 i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

 from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment i take refuge in the llama the three jewels

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:14.180
 we can kind of conclude that with the taking refuge in the ultimate sense so then you know

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:24.660
 a visualization we can do to just let go and release is then you know we can all of you know

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:31.780
 the beings of the six realms and our mother and father of this life just all alight and just

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:43.060
 instantly just flock all up and settle into all the the refuge tree you know mingling

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:50.100
 at one with all the objects of refuge and then all those objects of refuge surrounding guru

00:55:50.100 --> 00:56:00.100
 padmasambhava all mingle and become one with his body and then him you know smiling again to each

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:07.540
 one of us then we like a shooting star just shoot shoot right up into the heart center of guru

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:19.060
 padmasambhava and then just again resting our mind guru padmasambhava dissolves and we dissolve

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.300
 just

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:29.300
 mingling in that one space of openness and clarity and compassion

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:59.300
 so

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:29.300
 so

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:59.300
 so

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:18.740
 now instantly we're reappearing and again before us is guru padmasambhava and all

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:26.580
 the objects of refuge you know bearing witness upon again we're reconnecting with our bodhichitta

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:38.820
 aspiration and our commitment and our joy encourage commitment for actualizing the bodhichitta

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:39.140
 which

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:51.780
 is to become fully awakened for the benefit of beings being and again connecting with our four

00:58:51.780 --> 00:59:00.580
 boundless aspirations and with the commitment to totally apply mindfully joyfully as steadily as

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:12.580
 possible all the six parameters are based on wisdom

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:52.340
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty i shall accomplish the benefits and happiness

00:59:52.340 --> 01:00:00.420
 of all sentient parent beings from now until some sorrow becomes empty i shall accomplish

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:28.260
 maintaining the meditation and we'll all go at our own pace reciting this bodhichitta vows

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:40.260
 so

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.260
 now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.260
 from now until some sorrow

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:22.260
 from now until some sorrow

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:46.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:56.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:02.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:18.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:24.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:32.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:02:52.420 --> 01:03:20.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:48.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:03:48.420 --> 01:04:16.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:44.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:56.420
 from now until some sorrow becomes empty

01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:02.420
 i shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:06.420

 i shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:42.420
 i shall just rest in the ultimate bodhichitta, absolute bodhichitta

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:48.420
 the white light from our heart shining to all the infinite beings

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:54.420
 and then we can just relax our mind with the essence bodhichitta

01:05:54.420 --> 01:06:02.420
 and again with our mind's own openness, clarity, compassion

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:12.420
 just all pervading rest in that ocean

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:26.420
 fully open for all beings

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:56.420
 you can see the light from our heart shining to all the infinite beings

01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:14.420
 you can see the light from our heart shining to all the infinite beings

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:28.420
 you can see the light from our heart shining to all the infinite beings

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:38.420
 you can see the light from our heart shining to all the infinite beings

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:52.420
 and now we'll connect with the mandala offering the accumulation of merit

01:07:52.420 --> 01:08:00.420
 again assembling if you have the actual mandala plate with some offerings of grains and jewels or

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:00.420
 whatever

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:06.420
 of course you can offer that and then those of us who don't we can make the mandala mudra

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:14.040
 again what are we doing? Before us again is guru padmasambhava embodiment of all the objects of

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.420
 refuge

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:23.580
 that is to say the whole mandala of enlightened blessings and realization and enlightened

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.420
 activities

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:32.420
 all pervading fully ripened awakened state is the mandala of guru padmasambhava

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:40.420
 is the object of refuge mandala and what are we doing? We're accumulating merit

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:48.420
 as we accumulate our wisdom here with just this supremely powerful skillful means practice

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:53.420
 we're offering this representation of the universe which is to say just like we say

01:08:53.420 --> 01:09:03.420
 we're offering all with our joy our devotion our bodhicitta we're offering all and every experience

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:13.420
 to the realization of the and activities and benefit you know with joy to the three jewels

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:31.420
 which means it's intrinsically for the benefit of all beings

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:39.720
 the bodies enjoyments possessions and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes I offer to the

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.420

 and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes I offer to the three jewels in order to complete

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.420
 the two accumulations

01:10:39.420 --> 01:11:01.600
 in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations in order to

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.420
 complete the two accumulations

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:25.420
 in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations

01:11:32.420 --> 01:12:01.020
 in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations in order to

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.420

 in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations in order to

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:30.420

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:11.940
 the bodies enjoyments possessions and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes I offer to the

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.420
 three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:22.330
 the bodies enjoyments possessions and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes I offer to the

 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.420
 accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations

 in order to complete the two accumulations in order to complete the two accumulations in order to

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:07.420
 complete the two accumulations

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:33.420
 I will engage with the fourth section the purification of our obscurations

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:42.260
 with the profound meditation of Vajrasattva, Vajrasattva's embodiment of the fully awakened indest

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:47.420
ructible fully omniscient lama of this life

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:59.470
 and then again, like Duryama Vichai said, the path is 99% removing our obscurations and the causes

01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.420
 of our obscurations

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:06.980
 again I might be using terms we're not familiar with but we've gone over them and I'm sure we will

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.420
 in the future but using the four powers

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:19.420
 just essentially bathing in the nectar stream of Vajrasattva inseparable from the lama and we can

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.420
 just let that nectar stream flow through

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:30.860
 cleanse all of our channels and winds, clear off all of our karmic connections, purify everyone

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.420
 into the fully enlightened state

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:41.120
 and just as we're going to whatever degree we can just reflect on with remorse and the wish to not

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.420
 repeat and again connecting with our true motivation

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:53.420
 and our bodhicitta and devotion and courage recognize our mistakes as mistakes both ones we know

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.420
 and of course all of those we don't

01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:02.960
 especially just the fundamental or fundamental ignorance and all the mistakes we've made upon after

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.420
 them

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:27.710
 above one's head is Vajrasattva inseparable from the lama from Vajrasattva's body and nectar stream

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.420
 descends purifying one's obscurations

01:17:49.420 --> 01:18:14.380
 and all of our nectar stream descends purify everyone into the fully enlightened state and the n

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:14.380
ectar stream descends purify everyone into the fully enlightened state and the nectar stream desc

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:14.420
ends purify everyone into the fully enlightened state

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:33.420
 above one's head is Vajrasattva's body and the nectar stream descends purify everyone into the

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.320
 fully enlightened state and the nectar stream descends purify everyone into the fully enlightened

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:34.420
 state

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.260

 (gentle music)

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:25.060
 - Now we move on to the fifth section,

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.860
 really the core essence of all of the practice,

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.940
 inseparable from everything, all bodhicitta,

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:37.140
 all mandalas, all purification, all fully ripening,

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.140
 swiftly penetrating blessings of the guru yoga.

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:45.600
 So now, again, just briefly, the visualization.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.380
 We ourselves now are Vajrayogini,

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:54.260
 the supreme student, perfect student, Yeshe Sojal.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.900
 So we are Yeshe Sojal, and before us, again,

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:02.220
 is the living guru Patmasambhava,

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.420
 and then we'll make with a heartfelt aspirations

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:08.300
 and joy, devotion, bodhicitta,

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.780
 we'll recite this supplication,

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:14.040
 and then do the actual guru yoga,

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.580
 reciting the Vajra Guru mantra,

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.700
 letting that circulate throughout all our winds

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.960
 and channels and all the universe,

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.140
 receiving all the blessings and blessing lights,

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:28.700
 all the empowerments from guru Patmasambhava,

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.700
 purify all our obscurations and fully ripen in

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:37.680
 our own tatagatagarva, our own Buddha nature,

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.820
 to its full bloom, three kaya state of purity.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:50.840
 (singing in foreign language)

01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.220
 (singing in foreign language)

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.720
 One's self is Vajrayogini, and in the sky in front,

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.380
 the root teacher manifests in the form of Patmasambhava.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:11.100
 (singing in foreign language)

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.980
 (singing in foreign language)

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:53.120
 The embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times,

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.060
 without exception.

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:58.620
 Most excellent root teacher, I pray to you.

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:02.260
 In this and future lives, and in the Bardo,

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:05.760
 in these three, hold me with your compassion.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.460
 Bless me ceaselessly throughout the three times.

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.420
 The embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times,

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.180
 without exception.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.460
 Most excellent root teacher, I pray to you.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.580
 In this and future lives, and in the Bardo,

01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:23.940
 in these three, hold me with your compassion.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.400
 Bless me ceaselessly throughout the three times.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.240
 The embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.860
 without exception.

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.080
 Most excellent root teacher, I pray to you.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.540
 In this and future lives, and in the Bardo,

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:41.940
 in these three, hold me with your compassion.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:45.020
 Bless me ceaselessly throughout the three times.

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:50.180
 (singing in foreign language)

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:24.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:54.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:47.760
 - Oh man.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:54.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:24.500
 (singing in foreign language)

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:54.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:24.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:54.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:24.420
 (singing in foreign language)

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:48.600
 - The blessings and empowerment of body, speech, and mind

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.900
 are completely and perfectly obtained.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:55.820
 (singing in foreign language)

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.900
 - The lama dissolves into light, is absorbed into one's self,

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.900
 and becomes inseparable with one's own state of being.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.060
 Behold the emptiness, awareness, the true face of the lama.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.960
 (singing in foreign language)

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.960
 (singing in foreign language)

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.960
 (singing in foreign language)

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:19.960
 (singing in foreign language)

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.960
 (singing in foreign language)

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.280
 (singing in foreign language)

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:27.300
 - Quickly do these two additional sections of the lundra.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:32.140
 Poa, aspiration, connecting with all the good causes

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.100
 for taking rebirth in Dehvachen,

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:38.020
 and then the true, the charity of the body,

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.820
 the dedication of all of our virtue.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.880
 (singing in foreign language)

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:57.940
 - I pray to the protector Amitabha,

01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.220
 the Buddha of limitless light.

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:02.860
 Grant me the blessing to become accomplished

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:04.860
 in the profound path of Poa.

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.120
 I pray to the protector Amitabha,

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.460
 the Buddha of limitless light.

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.860
 Grant me the blessing to become accomplished

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.900
 in the profound path of Poa.

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.940
 I pray to the protector Amitabha,

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.260
 the Buddha of limitless light.

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.820
 Grant me the blessing to become accomplished

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.880
 in the profound path of Poa.

01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.420
 And now this seventh.

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.180
 (singing in foreign language)

01:40:49.180 --> 01:41:04.380
 Now my body, possessions, and the source of my virtue

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:07.420
 all together, I give without clinging

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.480
 to all beings who have been my parents.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.860
 May I accomplish great benefits unobstructedly

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:15.940
 for all beings.

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:20.340
 Now my body, possessions, and the source of my virtue

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.140
 all together, I give without clinging

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.020
 to all beings who have been my parents.

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.380
 May I accomplish great benefits unobstructedly

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.460
 for all beings.

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.380
 Now my body, possessions, and the source of my virtue

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.360
 all together, I give without clinging

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.140
 to all beings who have been my parents.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:44.660
 May I accomplish great benefits unobstructedly

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.240
 for all beings.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.360
 So that concludes the main part of our practice.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.700
 And now we'll do the third noble one.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:25.320
 Dedicate merit, make vast aspiration prayers,

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.900
 and seal our practice with that.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.940
 Again, just like we started with our joy,

01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:34.780
 appreciation, bodhicitta, devotion,

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.740
 kind of purity, understanding, the three vatras state.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.380
 And then we'll begin with these long life prayers

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.940
 for our teacher.

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.100
 And then if you have it, we've been reciting

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:51.060
 this prayer for the swift return

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.820
 of (speaking in foreign language)

01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:59.260
 This is a concise prayer written

01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.140
 by (speaking in foreign language)

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:04.060
 So if you have that, we'll recite this

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.340
 and then continue.

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:10.220
 So in our daily prayers, we'll begin on 29.

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.300
 But first we'll say this prayer,

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.540
 swift return prayer.

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:19.740
 (singing in foreign language)

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.060
 His Holiness, Dalai Lama, 29.

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:41.900
 (singing in foreign language)

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:54.220
 26.

01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.220
 (singing in foreign language)

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:04.900
 28.

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:08.560
 (singing in foreign language)

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:31.100
 And then continuing page 32.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.500
 By this merit, may all obtain omniscience.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.060
 May it defeat the enemy wrongdoing.

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:42.100
 From the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death.

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:45.880
 From the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.860
 May the sole source of benefit and happiness,

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.900
 the Buddhist teachings remain for a long time.

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:55.140
 And may the victory banner of the lives of the noble ones,

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.100
 the holders of the teachings remain firm.

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.620
 May all the temples and monasteries,

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.980
 all the readings and recitations of Dharma flourish.

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.560
 May the Sangha always be in harmony,

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:09.180
 and may our aspirations be achieved.

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:12.500
 The sole remedy for the suffering of sentient beings,

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.140
 the source of every joy is the teaching.

01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:19.580
 May it remain honorably upheld and flourish for a long time.

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.200
 May all the numberless beings who are sick

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.500
 be quickly freed from sickness.

01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.840
 May all the afflictions of sentient beings

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.820
 never again arise.

01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.020
 May all sentient beings always be joyful.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:35.420
 May all births into the lower realms cease forever.

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.660
 May the wishes of all the bodhisattvas and all the boonies

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.580
 swiftly reach fruition.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:44.340
 At this very moment, the peoples and nations of the earth

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:47.700
 may not even the names disease, famine, war, and suffering

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:51.500
 be heard, but rather may pure conduct, merit, wealth,

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.580
 and prosperity increase.

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.900
 And may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise.

01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.540
 The precious bodhicitta, it is without it, may it be generated.

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:05.140
 And those who have it may it never diminish,

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.860
 but always continue increasing.

01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:11.500
 Throughout the succession of lives into which I shall be born,

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:14.300
 may I attain the seven qualities of the upper realms

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.700
 of existence.

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:19.060
 May I meet the Dharma immediately after taking birth,

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.140
 and have the freedom to practice accordingly.

01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:26.260
 May I please the holy lamas and practice Dharma day and night

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:30.580
 by understanding the Dharma and practicing its inmost essence.

01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:34.060
 In that life may I cross the ocean of samsara.

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.860
 In samsara may I expound the excellent holy doctrine.

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:40.460
 May I not become bored and tired of accomplishing

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:44.420
 the benefit of others by my own tremendous impartial service

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:45.460
 to others.

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:48.380
 May everyone attain Buddhahood together.

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:51.460
 May the lotus feet of the guru who glorifies the teachings

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:55.300
 be firm, and the noble ones who hold the teachings encompass

01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.420
 the earth.

01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:59.700
 May the prosperity and dominion of the patrons of the teachings

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:02.620
 increase, and may the teachings auspiciously

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:04.860
 remain for a long time.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.100
 May the secret treasures of all the victorious ones,

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:10.660
 their incomparably supreme teachings,

01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:13.620
 arise as the sun in the sky, gloriously

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:17.460
 pervading the entire universe, an active essence of all

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.980
 the teachings of the victorious one,

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.900
 great charioteer of the secret Vajrayana teachings

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.700
 of the early translation school, emanation of nupchinsanjayeshe,

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.980
 great tirtansasam lingpa, may a profound treasure

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:33.140
 pervade the entire world.

01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.820
 May the soul swift path of all the Buddhas,

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:39.900
 the supreme vehicle, the great perfection, unanimously praised

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.540
 by all the victorious ones, the early translation school

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.900
 tradition of the king of the victorious ones,

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.220
 Padmasambhava, the conqueror's doctrine pervade auspiciously

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.180
 throughout all directions.

01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:55.580
 May the great tradition of kenpo shantarakshita,

01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:00.060
 lopampadmasambhava, and dharmakim, treesan, detsan, increase

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.620
 and spread throughout the three round world.

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.540
 May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind streams

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:09.780
 of beings remain inseparable and bring sublime well-being

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:11.780
 throughout the three times.

01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:15.460
 Deity, mantra, and dharmakaya are the nature

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.980
 of appearance, sound, and awareness.

01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:21.740
 The pervasive kaya and wisdom display of the Buddhas.

01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.980
 May practitioners of the profound and secret great perfection

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:29.660
 remain inseparable from the innermost one taste

01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:33.860
 awareness of wisdom mind.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:44.900
 Thank you again, everyone coming together,

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.380
 really making our teachers have given us

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:53.860
 such amazingly precious opportunity and places

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:58.100
 for study and practice and such a rich body of teachings

01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.740
 to really absorb into our heart.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:04.460
 So thank you coming together.

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.180
 And again, my apologies.

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:12.180
 Our vessel of an hour kind of overflowed over the brim

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:13.980
 to a little longer.

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:17.540
 So hope that only goes to nourish the night.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:18.980
 And we'll meet again.

01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.340
 Like I said, the next three Saturdays, we'll meet.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.220
 And then Kempo Sayon-Wampushe will be leading the winter

01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:30.820
 Zogchen retreat from our Pemeling retreat center in Florida.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:35.620
 So this is going to be an on-site winter retreat.

01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:40.100
 And last year, due to our dear precious Sangha brother,

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:45.220
 Tim Tavis, and so many other Sangha members coming together,

01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.660
 we're able to have the certificate of occupancy.

01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:52.980
 And so now we'll be having the full winter

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:56.780
 retreat at Pemeling this year.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:00.420
 So that's January 14 to 21.

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.380
 And you probably heard about it, but you can definitely

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:09.180
 find more information on the website, padmasambhava.org/events.

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.020
 And Pashe is giving the empowerment

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.540
 of the vidyadhara-lama, which is a precious term from sasum

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.300
 lingpa.

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.420
 And just thought to say, too, I mean, of course,

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:24.340
 any empowerment, especially of padmasambhava, is so special.

01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:26.180
 And then this is a very unique one

01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:29.740
 from our really precious lineage of sasum lingpa.

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:33.580
 And then also, when we continue with our practice, of course,

01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:36.460
 we always maintain our nundra practice.

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:38.100
 And please maintain that.

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.300
 And then also, as some of you may know,

01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:42.940
 when we complete our formal accumulations,

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.380
 then we also move on to our three-roots practices.

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:49.500
 So this practice of guru padmasambhava

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.060
 is one of the real essential ones

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:54.580
 that we in this Sangha practice during our three-roots

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.540
 accumulations.

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:58.980
 So if you've started that and need the empowerment

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:01.980
 and/or transmission, Rinpoche will

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:05.780
 be giving that on that Sunday, the 15th.

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:07.940
 And then the main Zokchen teachings for the week

01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:14.740
 will be from another teaching on the view, meditation, conduct

01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.500
 of Zokchen practice.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.660
 Thank you.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:19.180
 Have a good night.

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.740
 Hopefully, see you next week.

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.580
 Thank you.
