00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.060
 "By date Narasthana they originated a natural, basic luminosity, the clarity status, as they

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.290
 practiced during their lifetime and that moment they merged, they are abiding over with that

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.490
 natural status, status and they said, four, five, seven, even twenty-one days, many times we heard

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 those great practitioners stated twenty-one days, twenty days.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 Well, whatever the numbers they stated, three days, whatever, but they are resting in this reality,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 the true, basic, natural status.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 And of course that, this is, that is one of the Pardo practices. Pardo teaching is the one of the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.000
 big teachings of this fisparathic deity or the Chatur teachings.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I think maybe many of you already know these Pardo practices.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 But Pardo has every kind of divided Pardo. Pardo has six categories, all four categories.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 The four category is the principal categories. So every term now, for example, Pardo of the death.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 What we call Pardo? Pardo is translated as the intermediate status.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 So in a way, Pardo is what? As we always say, it's a dream status, dream status.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 There is four dream status. Pardo of the death, Pardo of the, what we most talk about, Pardo of the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 death and Pardo of the birth and Pardo of the living.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Those are the four Pardos, principal or those are the Pardos.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 But the Pardo is no other than the dream stage. They are dream.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.790
 So the Pardo, as we can translate it in another way, translate it, Pardo dream of the death, Pardo

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.000
 dream of the upper death and Pardo dream of the becoming

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 of the birth and Pardo dream of the living.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.660
 This all just dream. Everything is like dream. Pardo is no other than dream. Dreamer and dream, all

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.000
 is dream.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 It's not that we are the looker, watcher of the dream and we are not dream. We are dream.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Ourself, each and individually, we are the dream beings. That's why I think it's also here.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 They use the terminology, we are the dream teams. Dream teams.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 That they just say, whether they are completely on my team or they agree or not, I agree that too

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.000
 with dream teams.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And they are happy, very happy with dream teams. Truly, we are all dream teams.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Dream team, there's four different stage of the dream teams that we go through.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 This, the death is one of the dreams.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And the upper death is one of the dreams that we go through.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 And then birth is one of the dreams. And the living is one of the dreams.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.550
 So these four different dreams we go through. But this, the certainness of samadhi, true nature of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.000
 samadhi.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Poor and quiet, habitative pattern of the death.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 That also means, when we have this realization quite good, we are not really scared with the death.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 When you have habitative pattern, it's not something package, it's your release, and still the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.000
 death is just that.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Death is just another dream, dream.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.070
 So when you have the realization of this certainness truth, or certainness samadhi, or the true

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.000
 nature of this samadhi,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 then death is, I think, peace of case.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.480
 And that's why the witness by all those great masters, such as Luma Kipa, and all those great

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.000
 masters,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 practitioner, really is not just making kind of like Prince's statement, or something like that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Black, black. But truly, they ever deaths, they are witnessed.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Death is nothing but another dream stage.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 We have so many different dream stages, even in our life, one life, it's just certain.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.930
 So when you purify it, death, habitative pattern, we are not scared, we are not afraid, we are not

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.000
 hesitated.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Death is another, just transition, energy.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.550
 And again, in the teachings said, when you practice of this certainness samadhi, or this certain

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.000
ness samadhi,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 whatever it does, it will purify the habitative patterns of palmless realms.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Among the three realms, palm brain, I think whenever you know, palm brain,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 palmless, palmless realm, and palm brain, and the desire realms.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 There is three realms, all the samsara, but again, the way that they share the dreams, in one way,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.450
 they share the dream, the slightly different dream is experienced by these three different major

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.000
 groups of this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So this suchness samadhi, the true nature samadhi, will purify the habitative patterns.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Of the palmless realms.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And when will that all happen, what will it bring?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It will connect, as we say, the ordinary nature of the clear luminous status,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 and that means, it will connect into among the three enlightened status, dharmakaya buddha.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It's connecting to the dharmakaya status.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So when we are meditating, when we are in this true nature samadhi,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 what is the satin samadhi?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 We are experiencing and we are one building dharmakaya, dharmakaya buddhas.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 That is the weapon.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 So it will invoke, call it, call it, present of the dharmakaya, that moment.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So that is what all about is the satin samadhi.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And satin samadhi is the foundation of this visualization.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 From that we begin.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Because we like to have this visualization, not too much grasping, too much clinging,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 and not going to build another idea of the clinging and grasping and regiment conceptions.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Those all are unreal.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Those are obstacles.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Therefore, buddha, even though visualization is constructed,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 even though visualization is kind of like imagination or focus sometimes,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 but this imagination leads, as I said, or you know,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 to the beyond imagination, beyond grasping and clinging.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Therefore, this satin samadhi is the very foundation of the samadhi

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 and foundation of this visualization.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 From that we begin.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Because every time, for example, when we meditate every time or practice,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 we should stay pre-second or pre-moment or even pre-minutes in that status.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Just relax mind in that natural status.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Just without following all thoughts, just sit and abiding.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Experience the inner vast space and states.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Enjoy the vastness spirit of inner calm, peace, soothing.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Just relax.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 That is the most resting place that we can rest.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Without disturb by all the turbulence of these things.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Just rest for few seconds, pre-moment and free.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And this is kind of very soothing and calming and rejuvenated status.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And sit there.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 If you have time, for example.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Then, from that satin as great status, then second samadhi is developed.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Second samadhi is, then, as I said, or in Tibet,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 is called kundun namat thing, you see, I think.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 I mean, not I think, that's what the teachers say.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 That's kundun namat thing.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 And which means I translate it as all arising, all appearance.
