 [bell]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 [bell]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 [bell]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 [bell]

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 I just take this opportunity, we have a wonderful opportunity, it's one of our very great

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 opportunities for us.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 I'm not saying it's a great opportunity for everyone, but it's really just big things.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 For so many years we are looking, looking, thinking how to do it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.820
 And this week we are able to install the five stupas, one after another, four stupas already

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.000
 installed and pick the one, which is the big one.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:07.550
 Among the old stupas, which is 22 feet high, solid volcanic stones, we are able to bring from the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.000
 Indonesia with the larger, great efforts of the lama lori, lama laya,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 and the lama klava, they make so much effort to bring these things, so finally go.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.980
 And then we just thought this year is not going to be able to install, but suddenly big medical

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.000
 blessings are happening.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.240
 And then all our Sangha members in Padma Samye Ling have been extra, extra busy to prepare all the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.000
 mantras in every store, everything.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 Really blessed objects, we gathered all that, and everything they organized and they are so

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.000
 beautiful, perfectly, perfectly.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 And that's last week, this last Monday, then it's finally, it's started really installing and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.000
 putting together.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Again, during that time, all our Sangha members and the supporters have been extra, extra busy.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.580
 But really joy and happy and really beautiful, wonderful fulfillment of the regions of all the San

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.000
gha members, those who are here and those who are also there.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And our great Shicha and Khidya Padme Charumui has that also region so long, and with many others.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.510
 So it's really fulfilling and I think this will be completed, this coming week, early part of the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.000
 coming week and completed.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 I think it will happen as I thought to take this opportunity, share that.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.360
 And this is also, we dedicated this merit for all the sentient beings to the world peace, to all

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.480
 that remove the suffering, the difficulty troubles for every living, really beings, to their final

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.000
 commandments.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.550
 And that removing all the obstacles, disasters, nature, those disturbance, the fire, the water,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.000
 wind, the earth, so many things happening.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So really we dedicated this merit to every level. So please join with us, we dedicated this merit.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.010
 And also I'd like to say thank you so much. So many of our Sangha members and friends have sent a

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.000
 lot of places, objects, a lot of those minerals and cereals, the jewels, and really unbelievable,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 one after another.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.410
 But all went that in a stupa as you designated and you reached it as we said. It went there. If you

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 have the opportunity in the future, come here.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It's what you send, it's all in this stupas.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.900
 Solid walking stone, they told me at the beginning of the time we were discussing, I was curious

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.000
 how long this would last. They told me it would last 1,000 years, 1,000 years.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Then I joked, if it didn't last that long, I'm going to call you.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 But this is really going to last that long. So it is here, this big monument.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.150
 Even this does not last that long. I call it Buddha teaching because it's a monument of love and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.000
 compassion and devotion, peaceful, harmonious with respect to all living beings.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.030
 Even it only lasts that the dust as long as atoms or the dust remains that long, the merit and the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.000
 benefit will prevail as a ripple effect to every direction.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.030
 And all the times, the teaching. So we all did great things. Really, I thank you so much, everyone,

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.000
 your support and help, so many ways.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.430
 And because of you, we are able to do this. Thank you. Thank you, Trahi Delhi. And a happy Guru Moo

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.000
ji Day. Thank you.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Thank you, Trahi Delhi. Again, see you. Thank you.
