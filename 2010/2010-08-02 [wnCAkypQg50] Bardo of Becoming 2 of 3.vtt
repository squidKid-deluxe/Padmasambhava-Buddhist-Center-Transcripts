00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 "The vegans are uncertain because it's just an absolute dome. Oh, there's really so many absolute

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.000
 domes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 So it's uncertain, there's five or six what I said. All that is uncertain is also occurring.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Then, not just uncertainty, now this is. There is poor, kind of frightening situations that come.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And those are related with poor evidence of, sorry, wind, fire, water, and earth.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 Related. Poor, frightening situations come, and very piring, or very windy, very piring, very water

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.000
y, and very sparkly.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And all that experience, dream, related with that, kind of like, is similar in the dream.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 When you dream in the dream, when you feel cold, you feel you are traveling maybe with on the snow,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.000
 sometimes, never.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 But it's actually not really going on the snow, but because of the situation around all that time,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.260
 you feel cold, you are traveling in the snow, or something, eyes, or something. Similar that all

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.000
 comes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.340
 So for frightening situations, related with that, is also eraser. Then, emotions are now coming

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 more strongly.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Then, before it's light, it's kind of almost like this event, or under currents, completely burnt.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Now, the old habit patterns start coming up. All the habit patterns that we have accumulated,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 registered in ally.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.310
 All coming up, one up another. According to the situation, circumstances arises, and those are bur

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.000
ping up, one up another.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And those are then, particularly related with ignorance, attachment, anger.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.880
 There are four ravines come. Sorry, not four, three ravines come. White ravine, red ravine, and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000
 black ravines come.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 You feel you are falling on those two places, related with that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.760
 And then, according to the conduct of their lifetime, sometimes, and in their teaching, of course,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.000
 violence is bad.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.120
 Killing others is bad, the negatives. And then, because of that activity, you feel somebody is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.000
 killing you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.130
 Somebody is that kind of reflecting back to you, back to you what negative activity in a life that

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.000
 individually did.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Almost echoes back to us, one up another. So all that witness is coming, one up another.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.450
 And then, in the teaching said, not just that, every 49 days, every week, almost you die, due to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.000
 all those crashes, uncertainty, you lost your eyes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.110
 And then, each week, you take a rebirth again. So almost like seven times, you take, you die, or

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.000
 five times, six times, it depends.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.980
 You die, and you take a rebirth. Therefore, in the very end of teaching, there is a lot of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.000
 ceremonies.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 They do each week, high life, because change is taking that places, one after another.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Then, it's very important, and very, very special.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.980
 And then also, in the teaching said, because you see others, even the those, you see your family's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.000
 friends, and they don't see.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And then, you feel so upset, disappointed.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Particularly, they don't fight it curable about yourself.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Self, you feel more sad, more upset.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Therefore, in the teaching said, and generally, the world is called "harmon and priest."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 It's so important. All the time, it's a practice of dharma.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 But at least, if we're trying to maintain more harmon and priest's post, matters of their kind of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 belongings have to be disproved.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Trying to put side after 49 days, in the really teaching said, it's very, very important, it's good

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.000
.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 It's beneficial, beneficial for that individual, and that person is still in a part of status.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.530
 If they're gone, technically, birth early, then that is okay, but to make sure that kind of

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.000
 transition is smooth,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 and very peaceful to the others, they will bring more.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And then our practice, meditation, good deeds, whatever we do in their name is so important.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 In the teaching said, that time, you just get only what is dedicated to you in your name.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Then, well, after the mostly, mostly to them, then, therefore, any kind of meditative activities,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 good deeds,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 and dedicated that to them, then to all the beings.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 It is practice, it is very special, special.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And so, this is what is. And then, of course, so, this is what we go through.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.180
 And then, during that time, let's say 49 days, so about half of that, about half of that is mostly

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.000
 habit pattern of these lives.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:00.410
 About half of that now begin to show up or don't, in a way, don't end up next to our rebuild, next

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.000
 to our lives.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.530
 So that means it's kind of gradually the habit patterns of these lives or that life is demolishing

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.000
 gradually,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 and slowly coming up, the destination-like situations, habit patterns are showing up more strongly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 in a strong way.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And then, around that time, then, of course, it's just generally wherever it starts.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 But then, there is this, like, your future destination, kind of like passages overcome.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Those are related with the life, the teachings, and then, according to your kind of destination,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 then light is coming.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 And light is related with it. As God's realm, if you are going to take the bird in God's realm,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 then kind of wake, white light is coming.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Very soft, kind of dark, white light coming. And then we take a bird in the ashram, then red.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And human art is very vague, blue. And the animal is dark or vague, green.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And the hungry ghost is kind of, again, dull, pink, pink.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And then hell is dark, dark, dark light, all smoky light, very dull coming.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:53.760
 Among that five or six lights, what is coming more close to you is wherever you are going to take

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.000
 the bird.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.520
 It's more kind of inviting than that. So whatever the kind of destination you are going to take the

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.000
 bird,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:16.500
 whatever the kind of bird, then you take the bird. And then, particularly in the human realm, or as

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.000
 well as other places,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 but then here, here says, and the teaching says, "When this part of the rebirth is done upon me,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 hold one point that center great wish."

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 This wish or this aspiration, inspiration, inspiration or intention?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Intention is of course important. Aspiration, intention or praying is that so important.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 In this case, generally, again, even now, we just missed all that one or another opportunities.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 We are now kind of almost in the final steps of the next destination.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 But still, we can change the direction of the teachings.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.630
 There are two ways to change the direction. One is your practice of meditation in this character

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.000
 even is not so successful.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And the second is also your prayer. We prayed many times.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Even if we didn't get a realization, we prayed good things in the future. We prayed many times.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.880
 And we tried with that, the blessings of the Murali Pya Masambhava, or blessings of the Buddha, or

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.000
 blessings of Dara.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And these three combinations, many times, those individual practitioners can immediately kind of

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 regain their awareness.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.600
 Everness as you waking up from the dream.
