Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche taught the general overview of Dzogchen before giving extensive teachings on the specific views of each of the Mind (Semde), Space (Longde), and Pith Instruction (Mennagde) Sections of Dzogchen.\n\nSince every meditation practice always follows a particular view, understanding the Dzogchen view is exceptionally important for your practice to actually lead to the ultimate fruition of enlightenment in a single lifetime.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740
 We spoke already, we spoke already, we spoke already, but now we again according to teaching, what

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.690
 is a will? What is a will? That means how we should be understanding when we practice Dzogchen or

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.890
 how we should kind of keep in our mind. What should we keep in our mind when we practice Dzogchen?

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.000
 Dzogchen. That is simple we may be together. Now.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And here you can say that again, that we have been making so many times. What is in the tea is it?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.990
 The all phenomena existings, both samsara and nirvana, everything is displayed of the Dharmakaya.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.000
 Everything is displayed of Dharmakayas.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.630
 Dharmakaya is an unborn, natural qualities. And that Dharmakaya is your mind and my mind. This is

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.000
 Dharmakaya.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.120
 So all the both samsara, nirvana of your samsara, your nirvana is a reflection of your Dharmakaya.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:26.000
 Simple to tell. Everything is a reflection, display of one's own Dharmakaya.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 My Dharmakaya is my, for example, my Dharmakaya disciplines. Everyone in each of us, whatever we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.340
 perceive, whatever we see, whatever we do, whatever we think is display of your Dharmakaya

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.000
 disciplines.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Dharmakaya is known as self-born, pristine or great western, pristine, cognition status.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.660
 This is all inner nature, this is basic nature, this is simple nature, this we all have this nature

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.000
. You have that nature, I have that nature, every living beings has this nature.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.430
 No one is out of this natural nature. So therefore, all the phenomena that exist about samsara and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.000
 nirvana is originally enlightened.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:49.650
 It's not just brain enlightenment somewhere else or newly developed. It's originally enlightened.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 That is the what you are going to see. We are going to see that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.750
 We are going to think well, we are meditating on the tsokyu. Therefore, there was no need of doubt

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.000
 and hesitation and skeptical ideas during the meditation practice.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.350
 We are going to relax. And we are having skeptical and doubt and hesitation. That is what in the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:16.000
 teaching, you say, timities. That is timity. That is not fearlessness.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.640
 That is timity. You are now scared with that in a way. You are timid by the ego cleanness and the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.000
 habit patterns of the ego's or grasp's, manipulative.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Therefore, we should remain with therefore courage, confidence. Remain in that natural status.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Relax.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.260
 There is nothing to worry. Nothing to do. Nothing to think that I am going to miss. Nothing to sort

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.000
 it out. All is all in this downward diastasis.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.160
 This is in fact. This is the fact. That is the fact. Just relax. Relax this nature. And now to do

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.000
 this. With this understanding and what?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.520
 And that is again zokitanda known as nampachitanda, the great sky thunder. And the southern one,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:30.260
 even as a muslim, is un-publicated. There is nothing to do. And by recognizing this nature, then

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.000
 that individually reaching enlightenment, becoming good. That's what I said.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.220
 So that is the general rule of zokitanda. That means general rule in zokitanda can be divided as

00:04:50.220 --> 00:05:02.990
 three sections. And those are known as mind sections, space sections, beat instruction sections.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.000
 Those are the three.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.080
 So this is the general rule. A central rule and a central rule of all these three zokit schools or

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.000
 three different sections. And in the teaching don't use the schools.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.320
 He said this side. That is like every translated into English is sectional. So three sections. Now

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.000
 how these three sections?
