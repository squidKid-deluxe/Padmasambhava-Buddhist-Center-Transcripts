NOTE     "synopsis": "On January 20, 2014 during the 2014 Dzogchen Winter Retreat in West Palm Beach, Florida, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche strongly encouraged everyone to read and apply the condensed pith instructions by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche entitled, Heart Advice to All Practitioners. He said that this was personal advice directly from H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche to each and every one of us, and that we should contemplate and apply this in every meditation session to perfectly bring our practice to the final result of enlightenment. This is an amazing, inspiring video!\n\nHEART ADVICE TO ALL PRACTITIONERS\nBY HIS HOLINESS DUDJOM RINPOCHE\n\nDedicated practitioner at Yanglesho\u0308, fortunate one named Dawa,who practices from his heart, I give you these instructions with love from my heart.\n\nTo take full advantage of the life that is so difficult to obtain, resolve to free oneself from the ocean of samsaric suffering, trust that the three jewels are the infallible source of refuge, and do not be mistaken about the results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions. In particular, devotion to the root teacher, love and affection for samaya brothers and sisters, the bodhichitta of compassion toward all mother sentient beings, and the reduction of grasping due to the knowledge that all compounded things are impermanent are known as the four everlasting wealths of a practitioner and should be regarded as indispensable. The lama and yidam are inseparable from one's own mind. In the development stage, meditate all appearances to be as empty as the moon's reflection on water; all repetitions and utterances as the sound-emptiness of mantra. All this is the display of one's own single awareness of dharmata, the true nature. Within the space of dharmata, benefit and harm are nonexistent. So-called nirvana and samsara are labels corresponding primarily to hope and fear.\n\nWhen you recognize the original inherent wisdom as it is, activity will only add delusion; therefore, hold the fortress of awareness with nonaction. Let naked, ordinary mind go free. Then \"abiding\" and \"nonabiding\" will be nothing more than names. If thoughts arise, let them come, and let them self-liberate. If they don't arise, then let that be, and relax in that self-occurring state. If the faults of meditation\u2014torpor and scattering\u2014should arise, dispel them on the spot. When the clear light pervades both night and day without interruption, then, a la la! How wonderful! There'll be no need to hope for results in a future life. Please, practice diligently in this way.\n\nThus written by Jigdral Yeshe Dorje.\n\n\nExtracted from pages 136--137 of The Light of Fearless Indestructible Wisdom:\nThe Life and Legacy of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche\nby Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 And now we move to our one page instructions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 So this is the one page.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And now, it's already translated.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 So here, as I said, this is one of the very special teachings of the Hissamu Gidurumaki.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 And so we kind of follow that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And that also, it was what we were going to do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 So we will follow with that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 It will be refreshing all our practices.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Your practice and our practice.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 We had a great opportunity to receive many teachings from many great masters, one after another.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 We received that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 And this teaching, now we're going to not end the intellectual state on the brains.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 We're going to send that to the heart.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And when the intellectual is so important, we can understand and bring that by brains.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Brains.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 They're not left floating on the brain.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 And yes, they're kind of like hovering that altar.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 We're going to send that to the heart.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 And let it bloom from the heart.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And then shake that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Broom the heart and go to the speech, go to the body, and go to our environment.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Practice.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Practice is not outside.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Practice is not just become historic.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Oh, I received that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I received that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I did it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 I did that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 It's not just historic.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 We're going to make the change.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 We're going to make some of the difference.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 To make the difference, practice.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The teaching must say, come, absorb to the heart.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 When it becomes the heart, what is the teaching said?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Say, you become the Dharma.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You become the Dharma.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 We become the Dharma.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Dharma is not outside.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Dharma is our heart, our self, self, mental Dharma complete.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Separated Dharma and we, then our practice is not going anywhere, that means.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Practice is the one side, our self is this side,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 and then we become two different kind of species, aliens in one room.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And that is not going to happen too much.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Therefore, this teaching must be absorbed to the heart.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 To absorb that heart, this is the way to practice this.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Many times we also experience it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 We receive this teaching.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 We receive this practice.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 I've been practicing for a long time.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Practice said, but I don't see too much change.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 We experience that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I don't see too much change.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I've been practicing for 50 years, 20 years.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 I'm practicing it myself.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 If I say I've conquered Dharma, it must be like three or four years ago.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Or even maybe my parents, I'm sure, I'm not sure.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 They did, they told me that they talked to the teachings

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 and received those teachings so many times.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 But said, I am, I am.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Why?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Why this?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 This is experienced by me also, many of you too.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 I love saying every of you, all of you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 But some of those, definitely, we experience.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 We've been practicing, we've been receiving the teachings so long,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 but still our heart and mind is kind of like tough and strong

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 and just the most insane thing as we started.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Or maybe some guy looks a little more kind of failing with teaching.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Why this happened?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Why this happened?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 This we can look to this, extend it to you.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 At the beginning of the time, we planted beautiful flower trees.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Beautiful fruit trees, flowers.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 It's blooming so beautiful.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 It's so uplifting when we sit at a nursery.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Nursery was so beautiful.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 I want that in my yard.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 I'm going to plant it there.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And we are both that beautiful and planted there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 And for us, few days or weeks, something is so nice in the growing.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And now, that is not exactly growing as you see at that nursery.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Or no, it's not growing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Exactly those person told you what is going to happen.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 It happened.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And you read the plant instructions at very beginning time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Oh, this and that and that.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 I can do that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But then, maybe we neglected.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 We didn't read.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 We read those things and heard those instructions,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 but then we just generally paid too much attention.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Now what we need?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And if your grand brain are still, this plant looks really pathetic.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 That's celebrating some answers.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Not really you want to do.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Now you go back to the maybe nursery or ask the expert or read that manual.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Now is the time to put something to do.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And it's what we call the miracle growth.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 There's two different miracle growths.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 I believe that.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 One miracle growth is a very ancient and a very environmental friend of miracle growth.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And other is a miracle growth.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Now, any however you use, we have to use something to that.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And we like to really bloom that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 So, that is examples of this.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 This time, this is really like miracle growth.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Very ecological friend.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Ecological friend, miracle growth of our separate your realization.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Our separate your developments.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Developments.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 That.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And so therefore, this is what you please take this home.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Really, take this and keep that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And read occasionally.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 It's so short.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 So condense.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And apply that.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 This didn't mean that you have to change your practice.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Your meditation.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Your this and that thing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Whatever you're doing there.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 But apply this and stop this.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And stop this.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Keep up that fridge.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Keep up that good qualities.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Keep up the practice.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Let grow.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Let deepen.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Let expand it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 That's our wish.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 That's your wish.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 That's my wish.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 We all wish that.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 We like to do something beautiful things.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 As we started.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 We like to move continually your.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And if we're doing good, not disappointed by our practices.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Practices.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 But to do this, this is what really it is.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So therefore, this is very special teachings of the great master.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 As you read this.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 From his heart.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Even in the here.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 So begin to this.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Of course, it's down here.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Dedicated practices at the young issue.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 The fortunate one, named Dawa.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Of course, this is the dedicated practices at the young issue.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 The fortunate Dawa.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 At that time, his own is kind of like a target to that individualist.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 But it's not just only him.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 To all of us.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Dedicated practices.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 To all of us.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 All of them.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Name whatever our names.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 This is we can take as personal message from his own new teachers.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Each of us.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 We can take.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Dedicated practitioners in the southern floor of us.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Dedicated practitioners in this and that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And you must.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 What means dedicated practitioners?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 That means also we're dedicated to that.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 That means we should be strong.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Courage and commitment.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Keep up the practices.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Keep up the practices.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 As dedicated.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 You really love the practices.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 You like the practices.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 You try to change the practices.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And that is the what it is.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And also it means.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It means dedicated in the Tibetan.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 It's called Yardamki.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Yardamki means something loyalty.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Loyalty.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Loyalty.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 As you started or as we started.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 We like to be loyal to our practices.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Not just occasionally what we need.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 This and that.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And once in a while this is something we call it as 9-1-1 hospital.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Or 4-1-1-1-1.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 This is not occasion.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 We like to keep up.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Same thing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 As our self.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 As our health.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 As our life.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 We like to keep up.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 It's not something that we are doing is to please someone.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 To favor our something.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 We are doing that for our self.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 To make.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 We are exploring our beauty.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 That is dharma.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 The other dharma practice means it's not something that how.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 We really are making difference to our mental state.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 We are revealing our treasures.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Treasure of the Buddha nature.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 We are revealing the law.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 We are revealing the compassion.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 We are revealing the understanding.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 We are revealing the respect and appreciation.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 We are revealing of the joy.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Joy.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 We are revealing of the openness.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Clarities.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Vastras.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 And by that what we are cleansing Buddha by.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Immediately is shedding away.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 All the obscurations.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Obstacles.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Negativities.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 All that is bothering to us.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Strap ourselves.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 All the scars.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 All the wounds.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 All our young times.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 All the past.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Those are healing.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Those are removing.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Those are cleaning.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 You are making difference.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 We are not just relying to the external something.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 We are sub equipped in sufficient.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 We are revealing our tools to make that.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 This is what called organics.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 This is organics.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 It is not something that you are bringing aliens to here.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Try to make some difference for short terms.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Short terms.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Yours are bringing up that and purify and back in the difference.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 To do this, that is the instrument.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Yardamji.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Yardamji means something dedicated.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Loyalist.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Loyal to the practices.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Practices.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And to that and then practitioners.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 From his heart.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 So that means Yardamji is not available.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 From your practice.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Dedicated.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 From your heart.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 It is not something that you like to join this for someone.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 But you like to practice.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 So therefore I give you this instruction from my heart.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 It is on the universe.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 From my heart.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 That is what he is giving to us.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 How he is giving.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 He is not giving this advice with emotions such as anger and jealous,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 ethical, arrogance that I am this and that.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 He is giving this advice with love, with respect, with tender, with gentle.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Gentle.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 He is giving this advice.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 He is giving that advice to me.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 He is giving that advice to all of us.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 That is what he is.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 With love, with compassion, with gentle, with respect, with appreciation,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 with lonely words.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 That is what he is giving to us.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And so now what are the advice?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Advice is, first is, is, is what?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 What we have now?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 First is, what we have is, we have beautiful opportunities.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Not opportunity.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 We have already beautiful situations.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Beautiful situations.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And beautiful circumstances.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 We are everything good.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Everything is good for us.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And that is what the Buddha teaching said as we all heard.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 I am saying this now, we are re-breaking our understanding, our realization,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 our knowledge that we received from a great master and that we will practice that.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 We are re-breaking that.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 We are re-blowing that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Therefore, again, what is the Buddha teaching said?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 It is, of course, you all know.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 It is precious human bones.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It is precious human body.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 It is precious life.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 It is so special.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 I mean that you all know.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Life is so special.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And life is so important.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And this time, it is not just a life.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Our life, your life, is so precious.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 So special.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And that is what the Buddha teaching often said.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Eighteen qualities.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Eighteen excellent qualities that we all have.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Truly, we all have that eight.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 And what those eight include is adjustable group that you already know.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 First is freedoms.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 And is freedoms.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 We have the freedoms that we are absolutely independent.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 We are absolutely freedom students.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 We have the choice.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 We can make the choice.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Nobody is the caterer.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 The caterers.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Nobody is preventing.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 And the temporary level and the long term levels.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And the long term level, we are the beautiful clay,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 these beautiful brilliant beings.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 We're not, you can't relate all those birth defectors, things.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Birth defectors, even in the heart and mind,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 they have the determination to practice it,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 but it could allow everything, what we said to them last week, we can do.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 We don't have that defections.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 That preventions.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 We have got very beautiful here.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 And then temporarily, there is also dictatorship or preventations.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 There is so much, so many restrictions applied externally.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 We can practice it again.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 We can do have the right choice, freedoms to do this.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 And we don't have that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And we can, I'm not talking this as a Buddha said,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 but we can correct ourselves.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 It's true or not?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 It's true or not?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 It's true.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 We can mark every item that we use.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 We got this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Each time you can mark the correct marks.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 What's called mistake?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Check up.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Check up.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Check up.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Check up.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 All is true.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 One after another is true.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 We have that, that freedoms.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 And mentally, mentally, also sometimes physically,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 kind of like true disturbance or prevent it,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 and they sometimes mentally also prevent it, block it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 For us, all of mental is also open.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 We mind, open-minded, very open-minded, minded.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 That is not a lectures, open-mindedness.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 If you're not open-minded, even your physique,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 even your extracurricular situation is perfectly,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 then the essential is missing.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's closed.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Door is closed.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Window is closed.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Skylight is closed.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Nothing is happening.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 It's damp and dark and cold and ice and blocked.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And we are not.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 We open mind.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Our doors and the ventilation is everything open.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 The sunlight is coming.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 It's beautiful.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Clear will not block the minds.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 And there's stories that you've heard in Japan.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 That even happened during the Buddha's times.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Buddha's time.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And the Buddha is false.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Buddha is total enlightenment.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 He is one of the great teachers in his stories.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Buddha is true.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 He's such a great teacher.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Buddha.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And he has attendance.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 To be called, "Lukwakan."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And in the teachings, he was also in the relatives of the Buddha Shakyamunis.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 He has been probated with the Buddha all the times.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 But his mind is completely closed.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 His heart is closed.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 When he's staying with the Buddha, he's accompanying with the Buddha.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 His heart and mind is closed.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Completely closed.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 When your mind and heart are closed, what is coming up?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 All the negative, unhealthy posts generally come up.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 What are those?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Those are not doubt, hesitations, scepticals.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Then always, "I'm not right. This is wrong. This is wrong."

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 You close.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 What is closed?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Closely is the goodness is closed.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 And badness is, in a way, opened the door.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 All the suspicious doubt, that which is not going to help the individual,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 is not going to help anyone.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Actually, he's standing, undermining.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Mind, that will start to open to these individuals.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Gathong Lapakkara, teaching said, Lapakkara.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 He was ordained, Lapakkara.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Extremely he's ordained.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 As they move, ordained.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 But in working, he's dark, closed.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 So what does he say?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 The Buddha said, "I don't see any one good college of them."

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And the Buddha gave the teachings, he said,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 "I know those, I know those, those, so I don't see anything."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 What he has extra, is he has little glowing light.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 But what that means, what that's better, big deals.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 That glowing light, the sun is shining.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 I know all that what he's talking, talking.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 I'm actually better than him.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 I'm not going to stay with him, I'm going to live with you.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 So he said that, he laughed.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 This is the story.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 When you close that, no matter how much you have opportunity,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 how much abundance you have, how much richness you have,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 rich health, we're not really getting benefits, full benefits of this, benefits of this.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 So those, generally, who goes with together, get more expert.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 I heard that story, I'm sure you may be heard,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 and you can correct what I might, when I tell the stories.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 This is the Urban Einstein's.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Urban Einstein's, no, Urban Einstein's.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And Urban Einstein's was invited by all the universities and everywhere,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 those gurus and all that they wanted.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 And he gave always lectures, lectures.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 And then he has one chauffeur I heard, one chauffeur.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 So he goes, chauffeur goes everywhere.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Everywhere.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And then also he had the opportunity to attend all the lectures.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Lectures.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And so one day, I think they asked me, very good friend.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 One very good friend.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So he said, you talk always the same thing.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 It's the same thing, same thing.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 It's nothing really, that I can talk.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Can I talk what you're going to give today?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 I can give that lecture to you, for instance.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Yes.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Okay, you do that.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 So now, the chauffeur went with the lecture,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 and Einstein said, I see the audience.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 So then, the chauffeur gave excellent talks.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Excellent talks.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 And then the question and answer came.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 So now, question and answer, I think, because when it comes,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 the question and answer times, then I think somebody asked,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 something very sophisticated on questions.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 And now, he can answer.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 So he said what he said, oh, that's so easy.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Even my chauffeur can answer.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So that's what I do.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So in this case, he said, look at me.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And he thought, I know those things.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 What was I talking?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 He said, I'm an expert, more expert than himself.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So this is like yelling.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 [LAUGHTER]
