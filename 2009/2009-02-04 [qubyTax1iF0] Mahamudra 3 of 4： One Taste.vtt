00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Through the perception of, through the, it is "epilience", from the "epilience", cut the grasping

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 of the mind.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 There, guys, it is in the... That means, when we say "epilience", "epilience" in mind, that means "

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.000
my experience", we are talking to children, "our experience", "my experience".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.120
 Epilience is not coming from outside, okay? So, "epilience" is talking from our point of view, to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 our mind's point of view, okay?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.540
 So therefore, we see this able, we think that, but it's all to the matter of reflection, matter of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.000
 reflection of the mind, mind.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.780
 So that is mostly of the mind, mind. And so therefore, then, where is this mind? Clinging on the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.000
 mind, mind is empty.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Therefore, from the "epilience", cut the grasping of the mind.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.680
 And this, this again, the same way, that from the mind, mind, from the point of view, from the mind

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.000
, that classic, false image of this "epilience".

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.760
 Epilience. Who, again, this "epilience" looks so big, and so kind of wide, vast, and big, so

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.000
 pervasive, but it is this small mind, or this mind is displayed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.370
 It's not really outside. Epilience is mind. Mind, there is no even difference, this strengthens

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.000
 between mind and the "epilience" that we can see.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Therefore, this vastness of the "epilience" holds back to the one single state of this, our mind.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Therefore, the "epilience" minds are no difference.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It is the same. Therefore, it is called "one fist".

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 This "epilience" and "mind" are not our mind. There is no really difference at all.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Why are you now at that time? Why are you listening?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 From what I know, "epilience" is our mind. Right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We try to, again, we are really trying to divide this "epilience" mind separately.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 No, we cannot, because "epilience" is "mind", and "mind" is "epilience".

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.600
 There is no difference. Then it gathers, and then there is also, there is no respect, and no

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.000
 boundaries there at all.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 It depends "epilience" and "mind". Therefore, it is vast. It is infinite openness.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 It is pervasive vastness, openness. That is the between "mind" and "epilience".

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 There is nothing in "epilience". Therefore, "epilience". That is known as "one fist".

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 One fist is all his mind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 With this realization, or with this meditation, and then reciting this self-realization.
