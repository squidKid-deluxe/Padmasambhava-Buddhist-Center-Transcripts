00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
 So therefore, random surveys quickly sometimes break down our beautiful motivation. Therefore,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:19.120
 always in the teaching said, "Stay with capabilities, but always inspire joy of yourself," what you

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.440
 did, what you're able to do, and what you're delighted with what you're doing, not doing

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.720
 the performance of the bodhichitta activity with boring and with kind of force force, with joy,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.360
 with appreciation, with graceful, with great that I can do this, I'm doing this, I will do better

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.680
 tomorrow and the next week and the next day, and so kind of long lasting goal with joy and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.520
 the delightful, and that's the way known as the capability activity of the bodhichitta.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.040
 Then the moralities, morality is then with again follow the rules and guidelines of the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.760
 every aspects, the way you stay in the community or the guru, where you stay, there's rules of the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.480
 guidelines of the other, the beautiful human society ethics, that's it, that we should follow.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.560
 And there's many rules, the guidelines according that, that, and kind of keep up those known as

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.400
 morality. And then in the Dharma, there's many different instructions, guidelines, according

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.480
 to different yanas, for example, patimokya yanas, and bodhisattva yanas, and vaidya yana,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.080
 teaching, there's Buddha gives so many guidelines, so many instructions how to keep up those, our

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.360
 conduct and moralities. Again, this morality, conduct, what Buddha gives is actually support

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.000
 to growth of our practice, our meditation, our bodhisattva. It is like, what's called, when we

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.200
 go to the nursery, nursery, those plant things, each year when we buy the flower pot, or what's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.240
 called the plant, each time we buy the flower, there's a small level, stick out, there's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.480
 instructions,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.280
 this needs like three days in one water or something, and it is a semi-shade plant,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.600
 don't put in the sun too much, or don't put in shade too much. And then, and also the temperature,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.280
 why is this needed that? This old instruction gives. And this instruction is not just making

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.680
 our side more tired, more, making more trouble to us, but it's really all helpful conduct,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.200
 advice, tips, tips that well, that what we bought, that plant will make, grow so beautifully,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 so beautiful as we desired. Similarly, this morality instructions, what Buddha

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.880
 teaching gives, all that is beautiful tips, tips, I mean, we apply, then it will really bring the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.440
 growth of the realization as we want it, as is instructed, that will grow. Therefore, this

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 morality is so special. It's self is practice, it is gentle, it is peaceful, it is perfectly

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 balanced,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.560
 it is respecting appreciation, and staying perfectly in human society, and as average

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.320
 citizens, going nothing above and nothing below, but beautiful, it's just calm and soothing,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.480
 not struggling, and yes, it's spiritual. And that is reflection of the bodhicitta,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.680
 every man train those is known as bodhicitta. And then similarly, with the passion,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.360
 passion is bodhicitta. Again, practice bodhicitta is not something simple and easy, and immediately

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.160
 something just kind of so easy, easy. Bodhicitta practice is very, very challenging, very difficult

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.160
,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.280
 hardy, because sentient beings have so many desires, so many thoughts, even if we're doing

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.040
 the best, still maybe not necessary, they think the best. And even if we're staying

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.920
 perfectly in morality, perfectly in control, all that, still maybe provolting this and that.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 And we're not going to please them and happy them these practices, but we're practicing this

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.200
 for ourselves and to make our better self for the long vision we have. Therefore, we need courage

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.040
 and confidence and commitment to continue caring about each other with joy, with appreciation,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.120
 with reaffirming, reassuring ourselves each time. And therefore, passion is,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.360
 patient practice or tolerance practice means practice of courage, practice of confidence, practice

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.680
 of the commitment, that is what the patient means. And also patient practice means forgiveness,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.840
 forgiving to others, excuse, excuse, that and the more forward. We're not going to start with the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.920
 emotion and that and the more forward, but we're going to make everything best, everything our best

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.680
 of our ability to maintain and to count up these. That is, then there's many different levels of

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.160
 the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.120
 of the patient practices, but patient is generally, as you all know, tolerance means

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.960
 that something kind of difficult challenge comes. You stand in family with that and not pushing

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.440
 for yourself or not let kind of destroy yourself. You're keeping up, orderly that use all the

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.160
 different skills and methods according to the teaching and practices. And then, then we report.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.480
 In the way the other teaching opens, said let it go when the negative emotions are kind of raging

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.840
 to our mental states, let it go, let it go, that. It didn't mean that let it go, we just become so

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.920
 kind of casual and sloppy, but each time when we let it go, we just strengthen our awareness,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.360
 understand. So we have better technique, better understanding, better accepted how to deal with

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.560
 the situation is difficult and let it go. That principle, that means that not let hold down

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.440
 our practice of the both each other and that is known as the patient practices.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.760
 And then joyful effort is always necessary. Without the joyful effort, there's nothing going to

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.000
 itch,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.600
 nothing going to work. Even the samsara world, if we don't have the joyful effort,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.720
 it's completely stuff. And opposite of the joyful effort is laziness. And then it just kind of

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.320
 breaks down everything. So those are known as joyful effort. And then the concentration,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:03.120
 accumulation of your meditation, it is actualizing both each other. And through this we should then

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:13.200
 actualize both each other. But the intention, deep intention, is love, kindness, and compassion,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.840
 that thought for all sentient beings, beneficial thought for all sentient beings. That is really

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.200
 known as the both each other. Once we are actualizing both each other, then stage. And then also

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.600
 you can

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.120
 apply, there's the other way to kind of actualizing both each other. Those are known as the first.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.920
 Again, this is like, because generally ego-cling is always self-important, as I said before.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.360
 I'm the important. And I'm. And then the rest is just you. So I, I think also in English,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.440
 we put "I" in order to symbolize "I" is always a capital, I think. "I" is a capital,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.480
 that's what it's called. Rest is just a regular word. But whenever "I" comes, it's a capital,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.560
 "B" one. Have to stand tall among that letters. And that's how important "I" is.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.680
 And so now "I" is, I mean, it's important. And when we develop the both each other,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.720
 both we have to bring, everyone is equal. Everyone is equal. We all are equal. There's

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.680
 no really difference. Actually, it's true. It's no difference. We all, whether you're

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.600
 poor, whether you're rich, poor, or whatever, powerful, primus or non-primus, we all breathe

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:39.200
 the same air. We stay same, same on the earth. And we need same sunlight. Same thing. We eat

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.760
 the same healthy salad. Maybe they eat a little more, some occasionally named as organic salad.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:54.160
 This is both ritual, but basically eat the same salad, same tomatoes, same hamburger,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.970
 and hot drum, and the veggie burgers, or whatever. I mean, it's the same thing. Really, nothing

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.720
 else.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.080
 Us, us, that. We all the same. And this is not just a human being. It's the animals. Same.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.240
 Even we look a lot different, but same thing. We eat, and we will eat. Need, and all. It's

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.520
 not just that we eat and all that. Need and all is the same. Intentionally same.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:47.760
