00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Think of that. In that frame, what great master, Jamgon Kongtrul said, "The renunciation is the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.320
 anchor of the practices".

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.680
 Anchor. Anchor. Yeah, anchor.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 "The renunciation is the anchor of the practices".

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.600
 Devotion is the gateway of the practices. Devotion.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 And the compassion is the passage of the practices. Compassion.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 And the joyful effort is the central column. Central column of the practices.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 Or center life force. Life force of the practice. Or maybe not center or not center column.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 Life force. Life force of the practices.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 Mindfulness, alertness, coincidentness.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 "Aa". That "Aa".

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 "Aa" the inseparable or practice it.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 So these three, this mindfulness, alertness, consciousness, will never let pull apart

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 your practices. Practice, you will keep practices, practices, talking about it.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 And then, then, maybe I use the different terminology.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 What I said, devotion is the gateway to the practices.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 I said, devotion, I use PED. F-A-I-T-H. PED.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 PED is the gateway to the practices.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 And then, now, I put that mindfulness and all that.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 And the next one is, devotion is the miracle growth of the practices.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 The miracle growth of boost up. Boost up. That is.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 And the trust into the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha is the removal of the obstacles of the practices.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 It will remove the obstacles. Obstacles.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 And, remember in the instruction, the teacher will keep the passage without dilute it or dilute it.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 Or boost up below. Unmistakable.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 All the instruction, it will keep the practice unmistakable.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 So now, how many of you call P-A-T-H? F-A-T-H. That's the "ed".

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 This "ed" is the tracheous instruction that will really like to keep the practices.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 Like to get progresses.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.600
 So this, I talked a little bit about this first one.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 It's the anchor of the meditation practices.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 It's for renour sessions. Renour session is.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 Renour session monetize because all you have to renounce are your lives.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 Lives know these things. This is the kind of, whatever they call it.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 Dramatic. Dramatic statements.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 You think of the renour session, what are the renour sessions?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 When we talk about it, when I teach you talk.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 These four renour sessions, you know any good of practices.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 Permission to life. In parliament, cause and effort are inevitable.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 Samsara has trouble. Difficult.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 These are the four renour sessions.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 If we ever reflect these talks, totally, that is the supreme mindfulness.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 It is mindfulness.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.600
 And generally the whole good of teaching is mindfulness teaching.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 Then going beyond mindfulness.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 Not just hover on the surface with mindfulness going deeper.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 You think it's true. I'm not just making stories.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 Think. So this is so practical.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 This, what do you mean by the renour session? And Samsara also teaching said,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 poor point of the maintaining, training of the mind.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 And we have this thought very carefully.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 Think reflecting this thought, it makes our life so precious.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.600
 See the truth? So precious.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 Also we become so practical.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.600
 And we have more sensibles.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.600
 We become condoned to the earth, not hovering.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 And since we become practical, we won't waste our time.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 Unnecessarily, everything becomes so practical.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 Then calm, peace.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 And when we have that, it rewards us with more joy, more appreciation to the life.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 And it will remove the deep depression, anxiety and all those things.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 This is mindfulness. The supreme mindfulness.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.600
 You think. So this is about it.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 And then everything this. All those point of the thing.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 It is such a practical summary of the entire body of the practices.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
 Practices. This is about it.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 So now with those understanding, with those we were told and complete all of that.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 And then feel the presence of the GURAPE MASANO.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 Right in front of the sky, sky or right in front of us,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600
 who is inseparable with all the lineage masters.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 All your kind teachers, kind teachers came together one central state as GURAPE MASANO.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 See that? Really have strong delusions.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.600
 Strong faith or whatever the name.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 The other faith and the devotions are very subtle.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600
 There is nothing big difference.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 Devotions are more kind of rich, more calm, more peaceful.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
 And feel strongly that.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 And think that I am going to behold my inner here.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.600
 Say what? I am going to behold the sub-boning awareness of the Buddha Samhita Bhatta.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 I mean you look here. The face of the Buddha Samhita Bhatta.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.600
 That means absolute Buddha Samhita Bhatta.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 Buddha Samhita Bhatta can be divided five or many those in the teaching.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 But absolute, absolute or the awareness Samhita Bhatta.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 One's own awareness is the true Samhita Bhatta.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 I am going to behold that.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 I am not going to let that be the real of the dualities,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.600
 real of the ignorance, real of the kind.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 I am going to re-world that naturally.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 To benefit all living beings.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 Being such a strong companion, strong love, strong joy, and a strong trusty,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 strong feeling of depression as therefore sat down on the ground.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 Ground, ground.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 And do something calling Rama Bhatta as we do it.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Let's practice, start calling those.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600
 Those are the devotional practices.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 To devotional, to involve, to re-world our absolute awareness of Samhita Bhatta.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 Samhita Bhatta.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 Samhita Bhatta.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.600
 All have used the terminology, again not the opposite, that basic Dzogchi.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 The ground Dzogchi.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 That I like to re-world, already benefit for all beings.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 And then that Rama, as we joined in the prayers,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 our little excited joy filled and came to your Kannada chapters.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 And bless you, involve you there.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 Then finally that Rama, that great master of the Guru Pima Sabha,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.600
 who is the embodiment of all, then melt your token with the concept.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 Melt it, melt it in the light.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.600
 And melt it in the light of the great blissfulness.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 Blissfulness and enter your, then your heart center.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 Melt it with your own basic Dzogchi.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 Or remember with your once on awareness, Samhita Bhatta.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.600
 Then relax in that state for a few seconds or a few minutes, and we have time.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 Then that is continued meditation.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 That is continued meditation.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 And then here's our death.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.600
 I mean, I've said it for a few seconds, but that is the meditation.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 So then we move to the next prayer.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.400
 39, 9, and then he's going to do...
