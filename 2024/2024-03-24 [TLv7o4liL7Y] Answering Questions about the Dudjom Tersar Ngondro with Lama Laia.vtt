00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.960
 Thank you again. Welcome. Thank you for taking the time to come, reflect on the teachings,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 reflect on the practice, and take it to heart together for the benefit of everyone. So as

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.720
 usual, again, and again, and again, we come back as we begin to do that this hour, as

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 well as with anything connecting with these three essential attitudes, the three motivations

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.960
 of our practice, connecting with our joy, appreciation for this precious fleeting opportunity

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:03.240
 we have this moment, with all of its freedoms and endowments, and really connect, expand,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:15.080
 deepen, breathe with bravery and love, and all the four boundless attitudes, our bodhichitta,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.480
 thinking of every living being that we can truly be of benefit to them, that they can

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.880
 be free of suffering and all its causes, and know their true nature without any obscuration,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.520
 and that our own practice can be a means for that, but really heartfelt, big, vast bodhichitta

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:47.440
 connection, and then our purity, devotion, and trust to the true goodness nature of everything,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.520
 our own mind, our own heart, the minds and hearts of others, the essential nature of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.400
 everything is pure, enlightened, good, good from the beginning, beginningless beginning.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.720
 You know, these are the three kind of essential attitudes of all of our practice, and that's

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.640
 why it's so important that we're stressed by our precious teachers to really connect

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.660
 with these three motivations at the beginning of every session, because again, it's from

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.720
 these three attitudes, instilling them, reflecting on them, nurturing them in our mind and heart,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.320
 that's where all of our practice grows from and radiates and becomes more and more rich

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:49.520
 and full, it really keeps us right on our axis of a really beneficial and essential practice.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.240
 These three attitudes are the heart of the three yana practice, of the nine yanas, of

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.160
 all of our practice, and here we are doing the nundra, the essential practices.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 So I thought, you know, today, just reflecting more, we have such an ocean of teachings,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.200
 they all come back to our nundra practice, there's so much going on in our lives and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.440
 in this world, we can make meaning of it all and bring it to benefit through our practice.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.480
 So a few people have kind of asked some just real kind of on the ground questions regarding

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.960
 practice, the actual kind of structure of our practice.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:52.120
 So I just thought to kind of generally, gently, simply go over a little bit of that structure,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.840
 the frame, the container, that's going to really, that's the whole point of our formal

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.940
 practice, right, is to be a place to kind of catch and hold all these vast, profound

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.280
 ideas and take them to heart and make use of what's going on within ourselves and in

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 the world and bring it in with bodhicitta and all these, again, these essential attitudes

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:28.200
 and really bring benefit to everything arising.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.480
 So we've gone over it again, but I know again, I've talked, a few people had kind of asked

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.400
 these questions, so kind of just go over them again, and I don't know every single person

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.000
 who's joining us, especially through the webcast.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.880
 So again, people may be at different levels of familiarity with the practice.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 So we have our structure of our nundra, right, we have our basically our outer nundra and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 inner nundra.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.480
 And again, I'm not going to go into real specific details here, but just kind of give it a general

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.320
 overview to kind of balance everything out and then get to some real questions.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.640
 So our outer nundra is what these are these four thoughts that turn the mind towards the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.640
 Dharma, that we've gone over so many times, and kind of just even in the last several

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:36.380
 sessions that I've gone over kind of a little bit slowly, these four thoughts again that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.440
 turn the mind to the Dharma, that soften our mind, soften our hearts to kind of take account

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.440
 of our situation.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.920
 So again, what are they, in essence, really looking at samsara, looking at our situation,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.840
 which presently is samsara mind.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.000
 And we're not the only beings in samsara, everyone who hasn't realized their own nature

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.680
 in all the varying degrees of that is in samsara.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:19.360
 And samsara is suffering, is challenges, is anxious, is unknowing.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.080
 The cause of samsara is that not knowing, and all the actions we take based on to misunderstanding

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.160
 how things are, it's not reliable.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:42.040
 And yet within all of the experience of samsara, here we are, free of so many extreme situations.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.720
 Again, this precious human life the Buddha taught is ideal for being free of getting

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.160
 out of samsara.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.400
 We're free of so many extreme situations, both in the human realm as well as other realms

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.720
 of beings.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.920
 And we have, while we are in samsara, through our fortunate connection with the Buddhas who

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.760
 have realized their true nature, we have this wonderful connection and possibility to practice

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.200
 and take to heart.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.760
 And of course it's not forever, it's fleeting, impermanence.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.640
 And again, samsara has causes, the ignorance and the actions we take.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:44.880
 So reflecting on karma, cause and effect, again just briefly going over these four thoughts

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:55.320
 that turn the mind, impermanence, precious human birth, impermanence, the law of karma

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:03.520
 and that everything in samsara is uncomfortable.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:11.320
 So if we're looking for refuge in samsara, for relief in samsara, for certainty in samsara,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:20.040
 we're not going to find it in our ignorance, we're going to try to bring out our wisdom.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040
 And how do we do that?

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.560
 We do that through the guide, through those who have realized their wisdom, this is when

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:33.560
 we enter in this gate of refuge, which begins the whole path, the whole Buddhist path begins

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:43.960
 in that trust, that's you know, confidence and interest in the Buddha, in the Dharma,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:53.480
 in the Sangha, in the wisdom mind of the Buddha, one who has fully realized their own true

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:01.320
 nature of wisdom, love, compassion and through great kindness and our own good connections

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:11.720
 appears to turn others towards recognizing that in themselves in various myriad ways,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.920
 right?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.320
 So then we have the inner nundra practices, which are in five sections, five main sections.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:33.480
 We have our refuge bodhicitta, mandala offering, vajrasattva practice, guru yoga, and then

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:46.600
 additionally aspiration to realize and perfect our power practice and then dedicate everything

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.720
 with big bodhicitta, these kind of seven sections, but these five are the main sections are in

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.800
 every nundra practice, right?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:17.880
 So again, and then with our refuge practice, we're taking refuge from now until enlightenment.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:30.600
 What are we taking refuge in? Ultimately again, in the wisdom, in the Buddha, the fully developed,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:40.160
 fully awakened Buddha, the great kindness teacher, the Buddha who appeared in this fortunate

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:49.760
 Aion and through the sunlight of his message, so many other great enlightened beings have

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.280
 come to this world and ripen themselves in this world and share the teachings, even this

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.480
 second living Buddha, Padmasambhava.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.640
 So right in our refuge practice, we're saying from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:19.480
 I take refuge in the Lama, the three jewels.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:30.720
 So what is the Lama? This is again, the Lama is embodying all the Buddha, all the Buddhas

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:44.520
 here embodied as Guru Padmasambhava embodies all the teachings in all the ways they come

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:53.040
 and is fully realized their meaning embodies all the Sangha actually appearing in this

00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:07.200
 world and beyond all those who embody and practice and support each other.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.840
 And then especially in our Vajrayana teachings, the Lama, the teacher, the Guru, the Lama,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:24.920
 so ripe with realization and bodhicitta, knowledge, wisdom, realization, kindness, unrelenting

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:32.520
 compassion.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.640
 Having that guide in our life is so precious. I mean, Lama Dropa gave wonderful talk a few

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:48.040
 weeks ago about these qualities of the Lama. Again, we have in our nundra practice, Guru

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:54.720
 Padmasambhava is appearing as the refuge tree embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:02.760
 times of the past, of the present, of the future, inseparable from all the Arhats, all

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:13.360
 the bodhisattvas and all the Bhumis, every single teaching possible and shining forth

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:22.920
 all the Yidams, all the Dakinis, all the Dharmapalas. If all enlightened wisdom, activity,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.360
 blessings,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:31.000
 realization and enlightened activity is all encompassed and realized and embodied as Guru

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:40.760
 Padmasambhava, pervading all minds, all worlds, all experiences.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:48.640
 And we're standing before Guru Padmasambhava and all the objects of refuge in the refuge

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:58.040
 tree rising up out of this pure lake on a jewel, you know, lotus. And then our mother

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.880
 and father of this life are to our right and our left. These beautiful conditions, again,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:12.880
 in a way, our first teachers in this life. And then before us are all the beings of samsara

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 who all have their intrinsic nature and we just have not realized it. And we have this

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:27.040
 beautiful, all-pervading presence of Guru Padmasambhava embodied from now until attaining the heart

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:35.160
 of enlightenment. I take refuge in the Lama, the three jewels, the Buddha, the Dharma, the

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:43.880
 Sangha. And then of course, the Lama has appeared in this life. Guru Padmasambhava is the living

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:54.480
 Buddha of this time with everything I just said. But then on the ground, we have this

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:03.240
 precious opportunity of having qualified human teachers that we can encounter and interact

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.920
 with, ask questions, have guidance, see their example of how they are living in this world

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:19.760
 at this time. There's context like this famous saying, right? The human teacher of this life

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.200
 is kinder than all the Buddhas, kinder than the Buddha himself. He said, is here and we

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:39.600
 have this connection. So our own human teacher of this life is inseparable from Guru Padmasambhava.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.160
 So again, just the point of that is really remembered. That's an important part. Guru

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:52.840
 Padmasambhava, inseparable from our own human teacher of this life, the precious Kimpose

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.640
 and Dhanjal Rinpoche. Or if you have other teachers, again, the Buddhas are completely

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:07.720
 unimpeded. And we have, we are in this world at this time with these great masters. And

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:14.680
 so from now until attaining the Heart of Enlightenment, I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:14.680
.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:22.540
 And our Lama of this life is a qualified teacher, like Kimpose, Dhanjal Rinpoche, according to

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:30.220
 all the teachings. As students, we want to really look at what are the qualities of a

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:36.120
 qualified teacher? And of course, what are the qualities of a qualified student, but

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:48.240
 become familiar with them? And what are they essentially? They walk their talk. And then

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.360
 by observing a qualified teacher, equally important, we need to be like Kimpose, an

00:16:53.360 --> 00:17:01.920
 expert in knowing the qualities of a qualified teacher, be expert in contacting a qualified

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:10.880
 teacher. We have so many books, even so many recordings of qualified teachers. But we have

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:17.080
 qualified teachers such as Kimpose, Dhanjal Rinpoche, that we can meet in real life and

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:26.400
 talk one in one in real time in the same room. That's very precious. Making contact with

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.000
 that teacher, asking questions, receiving teachings, taking them to heart, asking, you know, more

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:46.040
 questions, keeping in that feedback in this life. So, how beautiful, how wonderful, if

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:54.160
 only we can all really continue to nourish that connection. That's why our teachers are

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:04.440
 here to guide us again beyond from in this life until enlightenment, in all the lives

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:15.360
 we meet. No one, no Buddha has ever appeared without a teacher. And we are here due to

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:22.380
 this beautiful lineage that's lived to this world due to the unending blossoming of these

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.600
 practitioners who've received the teachings and taken them to heart and moved through

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:40.840
 challenges, removed their obscurations, engendered their bodhicitta, uprooted their ego-clinging,

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:51.920
 revealed their own wisdom, and been a great guide for beings. So, one way to just kind

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.040
 of going on the rift of refuges, there's different ways, attitudes we can take refuge. One of

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:10.540
 them is just simply out of fear, fear of seeing how rocky this world is. And then, when we

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:19.120
 do feel that trust in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha, and we feel we meet this living

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:28.400
 being who's embodying so beautifully these teachings and really engendering them, making

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.360
 them available and understandable to ourselves and others. And we make a connection with

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:48.760
 that teacher, and we start to practice. We're going to change. We're going to become more

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:57.040
 aware of maybe our challenges. Things might even start to seem a little more rocky. But

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.960
 that doesn't necessarily mean something's wrong. So again, what I'm getting at is we

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.040
 take refuge from now, until attaining enlightenment. When we feel that trust, we have to remind

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:20.800
 ourselves that we are making connection with wisdom, with compassion, with love that's

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:30.080
 unconditional and uncontrived. And the more we can release the ways in which we are contrived

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:40.080
 and are stuck up, the more we can truly connect more with our nature. So I guess my whole

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.800
 point of going on and on about this is just that simple part from now until attaining the

00:20:46.800 --> 00:21:02.080
 heart of enlightenment, take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels, for the benefit of

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:11.320
 all beings. So then with our with our nundra practice itself, the Lama again embodies everything.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:18.040
 When we realize these four thoughts, the Lama is present, we appreciate more what the Lama

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:29.080
 has to, has offered us. We have more trust, more courage, more commitment to realize the

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:39.720
 path for the benefit of all beings. We can accumulate our wisdom, accumulate our merit,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:47.080
 fully ripen for the benefit of beings. And so with our practice in our nundra, we're

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:58.280
 doing that. And so like when as far as the time when we are doing our nundra practice,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.400
 everybody has different amounts of time available to them. So like when we're doing these Saturday

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:10.200
 nundras, generally, we kind of make the time we have about an hour, hour and 15 minutes

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 or so depending on how long we talk. So I've said it before, but I hope everyone knows

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:26.240
 the way we recite our nundra during these sessions, it's not limited to that. We want

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:34.080
 to recite that each section according to our time. So being familiar with the rhythm of

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:46.040
 the nundra connecting with the meaning is the most important. And so you can, we want

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.440
 to have the again, taking to heart these three frames or three ways of looking at our practice,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:58.280
 how we begin our main practice and how we conclude. So basically, again, like we've

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:05.960
 been doing, beginning with these three motivations, relaxing, breath purification, connecting with

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:15.600
 the three motivations, renunciation, bodhicitta, our devotion and pure perception, calling to

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:25.040
 the mind and heart, the lama and all the llamas of the lineage. And then we begin our practice

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:32.520
 and we often insert this calling the llama from a far prayer, which is a beautiful, wonderful,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:40.960
 spontaneous song from the heart of Deut. And then we'll go to after that, if you do do

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:47.480
 that, then we'll definitely go to the actual nundra practice. So again, these four thoughts,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:57.240
 this outer nundra, which is on page 27. Again, you can recite this at least three times.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:03.640
 You can say it all in Tibetan, all in English, English and Tibetan. Most important, reflect

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:18.320
 on the meaning. And then our refuge, the refuge practice. With the visualization, we're going

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.480
 to be doing this with full prostrations when possible, which again, we've described this

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.760
 before and we do it together. I think we don't need to describe what that is right now. So

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:36.760
 with the visualization, with the prostration, we're reciting these two lines. And again,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:45.040
 reflecting on the meaning that's so vast, but really with that love and devotion, joy,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:53.880
 commitment, courage, and affirmation in our heart, making our refuge vow for as long as

00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:04.960
 we can. And then going to bodhicitta, these two lines again, before the lineage, before

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.520
 Guru Padma Sambhaavan, all the objects of refuge, who kind of bear witness to us and

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:18.680
 support us and really connecting with our bodhicitta aspiration and our commitment to

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:26.640
 actualize our bodhicitta. Just like we say from now until samsara is empty, that we will

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.200
 accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings and all the ways that

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:42.920
 means accumulating merit with the mandala offering. If you have your mandala plate,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.520
 you can use that. And again, we've had a whole other sessions where we go through the details

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.020
 of these things. So even if you look on our YouTube channel, if you want to look at something

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:59.240
 we've said, I bet if you just search for mandala offering, you can find that. I think we had

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.280
 at least one session where we really went over the details of making the actual mandala

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:16.880
 offering with the plate and that, but essentially offering everything to the Supreme Goodness

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:24.760
 to the three jewels. And then purifying all of our obscurations with our Vajrasattva practice,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:33.720
 Vajrasattva again inseparable from the Lama, bearing witness to our own, you know, connecting

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.320
 with our own purification and recognizing our mistakes, including the ones we have not

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:48.100
 aren't aware of purifying through the profound means of this mantra recitation and visualization

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:57.760
 using the four supports. And then concluding that, and then we move to the guru yoga. Again,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:06.160
 embodiment of all mingling our mind with the realization mind of Guru Padmasambhava. And

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:15.040
 letting that dissolve after the mantra recitation. And then this aspiration for to realize the

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:25.000
 poet practice, making that connection with Amitabha as part of again, our living experience

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.080
 and then the charity of the body, dedication of virtues, reciting this. Again, all of this

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:39.840
 connecting with the meaning. And now someone was asking, of course, when we do this, we

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:49.720
 can recite, like I said, three times, all in English, all in Tibetan, Tibetan and English,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.480
 the meanings really, meaning and heart are essential. So however that makes sense for

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:06.360
 you. And then as you have time, you can recite as many times with each section. But you want

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.880
 to move through and complete the whole nundra move through the whole book. And then when

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.720
 you do that, then we're going to do this third part of concluding really dedicate the merit

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.440
 and make these beautiful aspiration prayers in one voice with a lineage like we always

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.160
 do. And then in the again, going back to the main section, someone was asking really just

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:35.760
 for really to clarify with accumulation practice, we have the skillful means of doing our

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.700
 accumulation

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:44.160
 of our nundra. And so we can do nundra without accumulations. Sure, again, it's connecting

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.560
 with that heart and the atmosphere that is embodying and holding all the teachings and

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:59.080
 all the practices. And then to kind of assess a skillful means for really ensuring that

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:07.480
 we kind of saturate our mind and heart and experience with these essential practices.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:15.080
 We do these accumulations. And so when we're told, and we're all encouraged to complete

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.640
 our nundra. And what does that mean? I mean, it means to realize it in the big picture,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:29.840
 really realize what all this wishes and practices for. And then more simply in this life, we're

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:41.240
 going to do 100,000 recitations of each of these five main practices. And so with a refuge

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.920
 that's combined with prostrations. So yes, what we're doing when we're accumulating each

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:57.080
 recitation is one full prostration and recitation of the refuge prayer. So we're really counting

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:11.160
 here, every prostration. So one recitation with one prostration is one. And we just do

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.240
 that again and again and again, drop by drop, an ocean is made, you know, again, according

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:25.240
 to our physical physical capacities and our time capacities. But keeping that constancy

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:31.420
 is important with all of this. And of course, prostrations, some of us are older, you know,

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:40.480
 so if you need to modify and ask your teacher. Okay. But yes, so as far in regard to the

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:50.960
 accumulations, one prostration with the prayer is one. So you can do one mala, two malas,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:56.200
 three malas, or sometimes if you have a like a tally counter, you can keep that on the

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:02.600
 floor and click it each time you go down. And you can say, I'm going to do my prostrations

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:11.840
 for five minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes, whatever is attainable

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:18.320
 for you to keep as a regular rhythm that you can hold up, not like exhaust yourself and

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:26.040
 be injured and not be able to do it. But what can we maintain on a regular basis, you know,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:34.480
 to again connect with the practice and generate, you know, heart connection. And then with

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.920
 our bodhicitta, what are we accumulating? We're accumulating every recitation of our

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:48.720
 bodhisattva vow here. So 100,000. And with our mandala offering, when we're really going

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:56.520
 to focus on accumulating the mandala section, it's with every time we offer the mandala,

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:03.960
 holding the plate, making the five continents and the sun and the moon, offering it all

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:12.120
 up, you know, to the three jewels, each time we do that is one and again, we add and we

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:18.440
 keep track of that. So we do like often, I just we don't have our mandala plates ready

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:25.680
 here and we often don't have enough time to really do a lot. So we do this mandala mudra.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.200
 But when you are doing and accumulating, especially when you're accumulating, you want to actually

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:40.560
 make the effort to get a mandala plate and have some grains and stones or whatever you're

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.320
 going to offer and have all the materials to actually make the mandala offering with

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:57.520
 the plate and the offerings. Okay. With the bodhicitta practice, then again with the meditation

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:06.400
 here as far as accumulations, every recitation of the hundred syllable mantra is one. So

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.920
 we're going to recite the within accumulating our nundra, this hundred hundred syllable

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:19.560
 mantra of Atrasava, we recite 100,000 times over the span of time we do it. So again,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.680
 it takes a little longer, but you just see, you know, I'm going to do, you know, 10 malas

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:33.580
 of this hundred syllable mantra, whatever is workable for you. But we're, we're collecting

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:43.400
 is the hundred syllable mantra. And then the it then that Vajrasava comes in and then we're

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.440
 reciting the six syllable Vajrasava mantra. And that's going out, you know, and we're

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:54.160
 just resounding with all the three realms revealed as the immaculate, you know, three

00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:01.720
 Kaya's and to Vajrasava state of everything. And that we're isn't necessarily part of the

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:08.920
 rest of the accumulation, but you do that for as long as you have time. And then with

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:16.240
 the guru yoga, again, with the meditation, with the heartfelt connection and the visualizations,

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.960
 then what we're accumulating here is every recitation of the Vajra guru mantra, Oma

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:32.560
 whom Vajra guru, Pema, see the home reciting that is one. So we recite 108, that's a hundred

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.440
 if we recite and so on and so forth. So what we're accumulating here is each recitation

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:46.400
 of the Vajra guru mantra. And then we complete that practice meditate, and then this six,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.680
 the transference and that making this heartfelt connection with Amitabha, this isn't part

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.080
 of the nundra accumulations. But again, we want do want to spend time with that. This

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:06.440
 is powerful connection we're making with Amitabha to attain, you know, become accomplished in

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:14.440
 the practice of Poa, which again, eventually, there's more teachings and more exact practices,

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:20.320
 but this is making that connection. And this essential kind of really important connection

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.880
 with Amitabha. And then this seventh, likewise, we're not necessarily doing an accumulation

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.760
 practice with this, but we're connecting with this pure motivation. And again, this is the

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:39.500
 seed of our true practice, our big bodhicitta practice, totally uprooting, you know, our

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:47.320
 ego clinging and being total nourishment for all beings everywhere. So I hope that's helpful.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:54.840
 And then also, as you can with your time, make sure to just totally relax. Like often

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.720
 when we're moving through this, we'll do a section, and then we'll just totally let go

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:10.000
 and just make the big offering, the big refuge, big bodhicitta, big purification, the big

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:24.640
 guru yoga of just as best we can, just totally letting go and just resting in our awareness.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:31.580
 Also doing that between each section of the nundra, if you can, but definitely at least

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:38.440
 after the guru yoga, or at the very end of the practice before you dedicate the merit,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:45.120
 or all of them, again, depending on your time. But I think really important that we do, do

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:55.040
 the work and relax, totally go home. And then again, reconnect with the visualization, the

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:10.720
 practice, and then that's where accumulating merit and wisdom as we go. So maybe we should

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:18.680
 just do the practice. I hope that's helpful. And I know I talked with a couple people who

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:24.000
 I said I'd address some of these questions with during this session. So forgive me if

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.360
 I forgot something, and please do write to us. It's nice if be wonderful if we were in

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:40.840
 like a real time interaction. But we're really kind of happy to go over the you know, these

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.360
 points because we're all here, right, we're practicing, we're studying together. So like

00:37:46.360 --> 00:38:01.800
 having that interchange is really nice. Okay, so thank you. I hope that was helpful. We

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.320
 all bring it to heart. And again, the main really just remembering how wonderful our

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:19.260
 opportunity is. And really being with our practice allowing it allowing it to purify

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:28.320
 us, to open us connect us with what's more authentic, with more wisdom, more love, more

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:37.960
 compassion, both in ourselves, and trusting to that nature in our teacher and the fully

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:49.480
 enlightened Buddha. So let's just have a few moments silence. And then we began our session

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.440
 with the seven line prayer and lineage prayer. So just kind of reconnecting with that will

00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:01.880
 recite the seven line, the seven line prayer and the short lineage prayers, meaning like

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:12.280
 what's in the intro book itself. And then we'll continue. Okay, thank you for taking

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:18.760
 the time to practice together, reflect on the teachings, dedicate the mirror, now we

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:30.800
 move into the world. I just thought I realized earlier, when I was talking about accumulations,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:40.200
 I did not go over that entirely completely. So right, I went over what counts as one accumulation

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.920
 for each of the five practices that were accumulating in the nundra. But I just thought of then

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:55.760
 of course, the overall goal is to do at least 100,000 100,000, sometimes they say even 111,000

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:08.000
 of each section. So I guess, I want to add, when we are accumulating, again, you see what

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:17.080
 works for you. But what just for clarity, what we're going to do is we begin the practice.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:24.480
 We move through each section, meaning, you know, opening prayers, the four thoughts,

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:34.720
 and then we go refuge, bodhicitta, mandala offering, watrasattva, guru yoga, and the

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:40.720
 endurance, and then the final dedication, and we dedicate the merit. So when you're

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:49.000
 accumulating, often Rinpoche's will have people begin by accumulating the guru yoga. So in

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.320
 that case, what we're going to do is again, you go through in sequence, the nundra opening

00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:07.480
 prayers, go through, you know, four thoughts, refuge, bodhicitta, mandala, vajrasattva, and

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:13.720
 then guru yoga. And when you get to the guru yoga, then you have the proportion of time

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:20.200
 of your practice really allow you to really sit and really accumulate and be with the

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:27.120
 meditation and the practice for whatever your goal is, whether it's, you know, 10 malas,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:37.680
 20 malas, whatever your goal is, and then continue. And then likewise, then say, often

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.720
 once you accumulate the guru yoga, then often then Rinpoche's will have people focus on

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:52.880
 the refuge with prostrations. So then similarly, you would have opening prayers for thoughts,

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.800
 and then have your the bulk of your the time of your practice be with the prostrations

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:05.920
 and refuge, but then allow so after you finish whichever you're going to do, you know, one

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:13.700
 mala of prostrations or whatever, 20 minutes of prostrations, you do that amount, and then

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:22.680
 finish, and then you continue and then go through the bodhicitta, mandala, vajrasattva,

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:29.440
 guru yoga, and then the poa transference, and then dedicate the merit. And then likewise,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.640
 once you finish that, then you might go through and then have the bulk be your vajrasattva,

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:42.520
 I mean your bodhicitta. And then when you complete that, then vajrasattva. And then once you've

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.720
 gone through all those, you've completed your nundro, wonderful. And then often we keep

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:55.480
 that practice, we keep accumulating some people accumulate many times. So I just thought that

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:01.960
 should be clear. And often, too, when you're just beginning your nundro, sometimes there's

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:07.760
 a practice which is called kind of like preparing the vessel. So you may begin, you accumulate,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.160
 you again, you go through the rhythm of going through the whole sadhana, and then you spend

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.830
 time, more time in the sections you're accumulating, going in the sequence. But then say you

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.600
 accumulate

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:28.560
 10,000 guru yoga, and then 10,000 prostrations and 10,000 bodhicitta, 10,000 mandala offerings,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.360
 10,000 vajrasattva. And then once you've done that cycle of accumulating 10,000 in each,

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:41.840
 then you finish, then you finish the guru yoga, finish the refuge, finish bodhicitta,

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:49.920
 finish mandala, finish the vajrasattva. So any questions, please feel free to call or write,

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:56.160
 but I just thought to go over that part of the accumulation as well. So thank you. We'll meet

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:03.360
 again next week, I think, and then that may be our last nundro session for a little while.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.240
 We have our one-month retreat starting, and then our summer programs here at Padmasamyaling are

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:31.840
 pretty much starting right away. So next week, we'll meet again. Thank you.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:45:03.840
