00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 In Anutta Antara, all the Inantata teachings, and then as well as the Anuyoga teaching here,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:17.600
 these three menala is started from our nature of the mind, from our mind, not started from outside,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.720
 then to here, started from outside,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.960
 and posed with the Samadha Badri. The Madara of Samadha Badri is once again in the nature of the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.440
 mind, which is free from the duality,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 free from the fabrication, and free from all the aspect. This very nugget nature of the mind is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.960
 then the Buddha Samadha Badri,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.400
 the Mother Samadha Badri. This Mother Samadha Badri is filled with great energy of comparison, all

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.240
 the every potential,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.120
 everything is filled with this thing, this Mother Nature. Everything you can imagine, that you can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.920
't imagine,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 that everything is within this nature of the mind, everything that's filled with this, without any

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.600
 contradiction, without any crowd, without any separation, and without any kind of like congestions.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 And it's filled with that, that is the Mother Samadha Badri. And this is totally union, union, then

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.480
 from this union,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.350
 all this, in life, the energy college, what would be the horizon one after another, without any

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.080
 order,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.640
 without any restriction, and all this arises. This is known as the children of the Samadha Badri,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 and the Badri, or the Great Brothers of the States. From this, then all these universes begin.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.400
 From all this display that you see is started from outside. So therefore, the will of the Anu Yoga,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.480
 yoga is, everything what you see is the Madara, everything is our conception, everything is our

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:16.480
 perception, and that is the Madara of this three Madara status. That is what you have to see.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.660
 So therefore, everything what we have, this with the mind, with the body, and that is what you see

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 outside,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 because it's reflected from us. Us, and that's what you see externally, everything is there.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.320
 Every day came in our convenience, convenience of this display, play and this emanation, as eman

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.320
ation.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.560
 And that is, again, a very kind of essential view of the Anu Yoga teachings, of practices.
