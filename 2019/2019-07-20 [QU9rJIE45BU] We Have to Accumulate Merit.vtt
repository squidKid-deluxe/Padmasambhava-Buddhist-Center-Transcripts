00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 That's great. Of course many of you are trying to say, "Oh, in the media and in the teaching,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.000
 everything is mine, you can't do that."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 But that is just too easy in making up ourself, making up easy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 So that's not really according to many of the teachings. Say, "That's not right."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 If you have the capability, if you have the opportunity, you can do after more, more labor.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Because we like to accumulate the merit.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Accumulate the merit, as I said many times, you all know, to merit.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 The visible merit and the invisible merit, another whole report.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 The visible merit is accumulation. Invisible is meditation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 So, to merit. So it's really good.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Unless you can't do any time and all those things, that's it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 But otherwise, you can do all the offerings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Thank you very much.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Okay, thank you.
