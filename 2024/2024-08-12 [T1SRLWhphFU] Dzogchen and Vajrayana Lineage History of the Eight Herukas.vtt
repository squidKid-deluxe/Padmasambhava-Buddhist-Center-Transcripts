00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.030
 Thank you, everyone. Good morning. Thank you very much everyone for participating. Welcome,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 everyone. Thank you.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 As you all know, we are offering the empowerment of the Eight Herukas.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Before we begin the ceremony of empowerment and it's part of the lineage teaching.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 There's instructions and introductions that go through that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 So we give some introductions and then we perform the ceremony or the empowerment.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 So that's what we will do. And again, of course, this empowerment teaching,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 this teaching comes from the ordinary. It starts with the Gratitude teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 who came 2,200 years ago in his world and he reached the enlightenment at age 35.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And then after enlightenment, he starts showing the will of Dharma

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 for until age 81 or until he enters Mahabharata in the wellness.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 So also all teachings are known as three twinning will of Dharma

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 and together with it as the twinning will of Dharma of the very inner teachings.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 So all those teachings, the very inner teachings are not written the will of Dharma

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 at that time in the common world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 But he gave the teaching, in most of the teachings, the foundation of the teachings of the Buddhism

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.000
.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Buddhism gave and later he gave also Mahayana teaching.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Even in certain Mahayana teaching, he kept the significance

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 because it reversed the deep meaning of the reality, nature, of the way everything starts.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Both in terms of worldly nature as well as the arising appearance.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Appearance, exactly as is nature. And what does that mean?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It means that entirely because before the teaching, when he gave the teaching,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 he gave as a cause and effort, such as well-known teaching, poor, noble, true teaching.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Poor, noble, true teaching can be condensed in a simple way.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 It teaches on the cause, condition and the result.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Everything what we see in the world, it has cause

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 and will produce the result with the conditions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 That's how it goes. Everything what we see in the world.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 In the same way in Narayana, everything has cause

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 and everything will produce the result and meet the particular conditions and cause.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So it's a cause and condition teachings, which externally cause and condition teachings

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.770
 and the regular teaching of the way things are varied, inwardly teachings on the way known as dh

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.000
arma.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Dharma is nothing but teachings on the cause and effect of the way things do.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Again, it has cause, it has effect, reality, nature.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 That's what we live with. More of the teaching, those are known as that,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 more highlighted teaching of 10 virtuous teachings and 10 non-virtuous teachings.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 It would award and attend non-virtuous and activate and attend virtuous activities

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 and that would bring great good karma or good result.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 That good karma means it will bring joy, peace, happiness,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 happiness and well-being and better karma means it will bring more sad, suffering, difficulties

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and then troubles, misfortunes, all that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Everything, that is what. And then they don't.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Also, if you continue to pray, it will develop beautiful, natural, river, river teachings.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Again, this is the teachings of what Buddha gives the first teaching.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Second term of the Dharma teaching, it is best with Mahayana teachings.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Mahayana teaching is explaining of the, again, best of the Pandryaka teaching

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 what Buddha already gave in the Pandryaka teaching.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Mahayana teaching is best on the Pandryaka teaching.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 It's not different. It's the same teaching.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 But then extended Buddha went more, one deeper level, more deeper.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Buddha explained it. Then all these phenomena existed.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Even though they appeared as solid poems and it's very complex existing,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 but reality naturally is hallucination. It's emptiness.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 We heard so many times, emptiness. Emptiness.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Because all these objects, every one you see, see,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 reality level, they are like bubbles, they are like mirages,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 they are like reflection, moon and water.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Those are terminology used by the great teacher to explain how things are.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Reality is all in the, it's just really hallucination and a bubble like that.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Even though in our eyes we see it as solid poems,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 even we see it from things to those that perform it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 But that is according to the teaching is because due to the grasping,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 clinging, we grasping and clinging, then it becomes solid.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But reality it is really very translucent, soft and mellow state.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 To prove that in very great masters, those who have high realization,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 that part of realization as it is, they go through walls,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 they are sitting in the sky, they perform all activities in the ears.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And as it starts forming the water in the fire, fire in the waters.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 This is not what many times we call miracle activities,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 but in the teaching making it is not miracle, it's reality where things are.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 You can, what we, who did miracles according to the eyes of the Buddha,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 we are the magicians.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 We are ourselves, duality consumption is a big magicians.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 It created all things that is not really exist,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 not really lined up with the realities.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It really changed completely.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 So in that sense, we are the big magicians.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 We met everything in the kind of different sections and chapters, all that.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 But reality of nature is flexible, pervasive, completely translucent state.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Those are the early teachings.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So that is like teaching on Mahayana teachings.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Then Mahayana, the teaching goes a deeper level,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 where the energy of the mind is known as the body type,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 kindly the complete thought of all living beings.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 I explained it strongly that in that nature, so Mahayana teaching.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And that is the second turning wheel of the Dharma,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 which is known as the Pandya Parama, the teachings mainly,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 the teachings on the Pandya Parama.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Also, the Buddha gave the teachings on the sages,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 the washers pick mountain or the northern India,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 and as well as in other locations, the Buddha gave the teachings.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And then third thing about the Dharma is the Buddha explaining more deeper level.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Now, going to the more deeper level of the everyone's mind,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 the nature of the mind.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 In the Buddhism, we all know, we all heard some time, this rebirth.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Life has not ended when we die this time.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 It will continue.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 What will continue at that time?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Our consciousness, our mind, that invisible mind is going to continue.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And what is going to continue?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 With all that is that whatever we have been prepared to be collected with this mind,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 whatever we can't register with our mind, that will continue.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 But the deep, dumb nature of the mind,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 the potency of the mind is the enlightenment nature,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 enlightenment of Buddha nature.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 That's the Buddha nature.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 What is that Buddha nature?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 It's loving kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 That is really the Buddha nature.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Nature.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So Buddha explained all that in the Thattu and the Veda Dharma

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 that every living being has this nature.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Same nature what Buddha himself has.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 No difference in that nature.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 That is the Mahayana teaching, Thattu and the Veda Dharma

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 and all the way to Veda Jana teaching and Doki teaching.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It's the same statement.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Everyone has the same beautiful richness, quality of nature of the mind.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 It's just waiting us.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Even in the midst of the samsara wall, when we are all difficult to trouble,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 but this enlightenment nature, Buddha nature is guiding us all the time.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 What does that mean?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Our love, compassion, wisdom, even we are completely caught with all the ego-cling and self-import

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.000
ance,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 and the happy dependent, yet it's coming out of that power

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 and light of the Buddha nature guiding us with love, kindness, compassion.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Everyone appreciates love and compassion.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Everyone.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 No one is excluded.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Everyone really appreciates it because that is the nature of everyone.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Everyone is a nature.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And together with that, wisdom, intelligence, smartness, skillfulness,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 all that is natural.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 So that is, then Buddha gives that teaching in the third turn of the Veda Dharma

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 and extends it in the Veda Jana teaching.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 So today's our teaching, what we are going to go through is the Veda Jana teaching.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Buddha gives the Veda Jana teaching.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 This Veda Jana teaching is also known as result Jana teachings.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Those Mahayana teachings, Sutra Mahayana teachings,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 and then the Pandigarh teaching, all are known as khozo janas.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 I think many of you already know that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Khozo Jana and the result Jana.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Why is that terminology?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Because it is.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Our goal is to lead the enlightenment, to discover any natures.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 In this condition, with the teaching, you kind of prepare to plan the preparation

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 and to get enlightenment or to get realization.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Text time is coming.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 You are working with the cause, you are working with the condition,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 trying by the good cause, good condition.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 So then we will get the achievement and realization.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 So then we get the realization comes later.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 So that means you are working with the cause and the condition.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 And result Jana is the Veda Jana teaching.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 You are working with it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Immediately you are like actualizing the result, achievement.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 That is called result Jana.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 What that means?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 You are ritualizing, for example, with the energy.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Immediately we visualize ourselves as a Buddha.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Meditation.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 We are not ready to become the Buddha.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 We become instantly through the power,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 and this khozo means we transform ourselves as Buddhas, the ritualization.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 When we transform the Buddha, Buddhas, at that time, not just we become the Buddha,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 but the environment of all this universal world we are.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 It also becomes pureness.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 So ourself is a Buddha, and our place where we are, we realize that is pureness.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So that is what really the environment of the Buddhas only enlightens beings.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So immediately we are actualizing that realization, that understanding.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Actualizing, therefore, is known as result Jana.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Immediately you are achieving the final goal of the journey, actualizing immediately that.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And of course that is true.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Still for me, still we have to work continually with courage and commitment

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 during the devotion and determination to actualize, to stabilize that.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 But immediately we actualize that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 That is what is called result Jana.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 So Ready Jana is the result Jana teaching.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Teachings, and today what we are going to give this teaching is connected with result Jana teaching

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.000
,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 which is known as Madhri Jana teaching, Tantal and Tantal teaching.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And within the Ready Jana teaching, there are two groups of the teachings.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 I know many of you already know these things.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 But in the teaching mission, we should highlight those things.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Even you already knew that.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Because we are remembering of the greatest kindness of these lineage masters.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 They continually carried this teaching from 2600 years ago.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And from now, we are today reconnecting that ourself to that teaching.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 So therefore, highlight of the way we really belong, where we come, where we reconnect like this.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah, so that's why really in the teaching mission, we shouldn't mention Tantal.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.110
 So, what are you doing? And these teachings, in that level and then, so this is the Ready Jana

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.000
 teaching.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 The Ready Jana teaching has two groups.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 The Outer Tantra, Inner Tantra is also called.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Outer Tantra, this is three teachings, which is known as Kriya Tantra, Yova Tantra,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 and Kriya Tantra, Yova Tantra, and Yova Tantra, two Tantra teachings.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And Inner Tantra, Mahayova, Anoyoga, and Atayoga teachings.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 But really, this teaching is known as Inner Tantra teachings.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Today, what we are going to offer is the Empowerment at Haruga teaching.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 On the 9th, Haruga teaching is Maha, Inner Tantra teaching.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Inner Tantra has three teachings, Mahayoga, Anoyoga, and Atayoga.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Those are the teachings. Three Inner Tantra teachings.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 In the Inunga school with Buddhism, always explaining three lineage teachings.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.670
 Mind to mind, transmission lineage, and symbolic transmission lineage, and all of transmission

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.000
 lineage.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 So, these Inner Tantra teachings are transmitted through three lineage, through lineage.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.310
 Mind to mind, transmission lineage, and the Dharmakaya Buddha give the teachings to all the display

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.000
 of the Dharmakaya.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 The Dharmakaya rectangles give the teachings of the mind to mind, transmission lineage,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 without the world, and without the level of symbols, and expounded teachings.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Completely, ultimately, absolutely, everything that is known as mind to mind, transmission lineage.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 All these rectangles, teachers and rectangles are almost really saying nothing big different,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 but yet, transmitted the teachings completely, without the world, without any symbolic gestures.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Keep the teaching. That is mind to mind, transmission lineage in the pure land of Akanishtas.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.310
 Akanishta is the source of the world which is beyond the conception, land which is beyond the

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.000
 conception.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Or pure land that which is beyond the conception.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.830
 And that pure land Dharmakaya Buddha gives to all the rectangles which is inseparable from his or

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.000
 her own what's the display.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 And then, second to any way of Dharmakaya is known as Sambhoka.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Sambhoka is also the way that happened in the pure land of Akanishtas, and as well as then with the

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Sambhokaya Buddha.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 They experimented again with all the five dhyana Buddhas.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And the Sambhokaya Buddha, such as the Buddha Vaidyadara, all the Vaidyas.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And the Sattva responded with the entire teaching through the sign, symbols.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Symbols, gestures, all just the Buddha smiled, all just the Buddha did come emanating some light,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 beautiful light.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And that moment they received the entirety.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Because those retinas are also highly enlightened, enlightened, enlightened states.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Therefore they don't have to go through the details, this and that.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.460
 The moment they are, when they are all in that part of the state, they are dancing, they are

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.000
 cheating,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 just spontaneously, just through sign and symbols and gestures, everything.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And that is really known as symbolic transmission lineage.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.580
 And then, other transmission lineage is from the Buddha, such as the Buddha Vaidyadvani, all the V

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.000
aidyas dharas, dharas, all Vaidyas dharas.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.370
 And as in the teaching method that is, the Buddha Shatyamuni came to Thod in 600 years, as he said,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.000
 he gave the Vaidyana teaching in higher levels.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.520
 Higher level in the different realms, different name, not really expounded Vaidyana teaching in

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.000
 this human world.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 But just before entering the Buddha Mahabharata in Nirvana, many great masters and bodhisattvas

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 said,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 "Buddha, you did not give the teachings of the Vaidyana teaching.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.710
 You give more causal teachings and the Mahayana teaching, but you did not give the Vaidyana

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.000
 teachings."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.530
 And some of those said that. And Buddha said, "And I get those teachings in the different pure

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.000
 lands already there,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 but when the time comes, time is ready, this teaching will appear soon in this world."

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 That's what Buddha said, said, and before he entered Mahabharata in Nirvana.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 So I called the lineage teaching his story, and 23 years after Buddha Mahabharata in Nirvana,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 then in the southern India, or there is called the Middle Right Mountains.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.940
 Middle Right Mountains, the poor, excellent Vaidyas dharas, highly realized beings, appeared in

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.000
 that mountains.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Come together, come together, and they saw, "A great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 his legal home is entered in Mahabharata, but in Nirvana, now there is no really become light.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.150
 Light exists there. The whole three universe or the world is become dark. Who will be spared these

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.000
 darknesses?"

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And they said those walls, 27 different colors.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 No, I think maybe I missed out, sorry. 27 years after Buddha Mahabharata in Nirvana,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 they came, and then there were 23 statements.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Statements, and those yearning statements, and that moment, Vaidyabhani appeared in the sky,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 and gave them the entire Inattentar teachings.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Inattentar teachings, particularly Vaidyayoga teachings.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Inattentar teachings mean Mahayoga, Anoyoga, and Adiyoga teachings.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 So they were only given the teachings.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 But really, among them, among the five Vaidyas dharas,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 or excellent Vaidyas dharas, there is called the Vaidyas dharas of the cannibals.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 It's not cannibals, cannibals, but it's just a kind, used name as cannibals.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Simple Lord Vithabhani in the debate.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 A very powerful, skillful man of the master, Lord Vithabhani.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Vithabhani, he wrote all the teachings in the Laput Ladi paper with gold ink,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 and hidden to the sky with about seven powers.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Seven powers of the hidden realization, hidden to discover these teachings.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And that moment then, he predicted that it will be discovered,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 and what happened soon, this teaching will be discovered.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 As he predicted, as mentioned, and that happened about the root of the cleanser,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 which is Eastern Tibet, so not Eastern Tibet, to be the Eastern Indian.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 India, sahora, sahora.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 So then this king Jha, see, on the roof, all the Mahayoga teachings appeared,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 or came or descended, and the teachings there.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And then he practiced and meditated, particularly practiced,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 he saw among them, Mahayoga, Tantra, Tantra, he saw,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 so there is called Vaidyas dharas, particularly to practice on Vaidyas dharas.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 He practiced on the Vaidyas dharas practices, and then he received.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 He saw Vaidyas dharas in the face-to-face, and he received the entire teaching,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 and that's how, then, these Vaidyas dharas teachings,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 how he descended to the human world, human world,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 human world, as like oral class missionary, from the patrician to the student,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 as oral class missionary.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 So that is really about the explaining of how these teachings appeared

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 come to this world, Vaidyana teachings.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And then sewn up, all the other Vaidyana teachings,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 such as Kariya Tantra, Yova Tantra, Upa Tantra, those are three outer tantras,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 and as well as, then all the other Yova teachings, the other Yova teachings,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 all those really came one after another, appeared in the world,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 and not just so big group level level,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 but very selected small group level that appeared to this world.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So that is really how this, how the teaching came to this world.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And now this particular Mahayoga teaching has two group teachings.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 That is known as the Tantra aspect of the Mahayoga teaching,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 and the practice aspect of Mahayoga teachings.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Tantra aspect of the Mahayoga teaching is about the hidden Mahayoga Tantras

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 and the root of the Mahayoga Tantra, as well as all inner Tantra,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 such as Anu Yova Tantra and Adi Yova Tantra,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 open shade, shade, the Shingohyangarpa teaching,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 which is translated like, you know, in India.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 It is very well known, well known teaching, very famous teaching,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 that is Bhagavat and the root of all Mahayoga teachings,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 not just only the Mahayoga teachings, but Anu Yova, Adi Yova teachings.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Because in the teachings said, Mahayoga is a foundation of the teaching,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Anu Yova is a part of the teaching, and Adi Yova is a result of the teaching.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So all the Anu Yova and Adi Yova teachings are really only based on the Mahayoga teachings.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 So that's how it is.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And now, this Mahayoga teaching, as I said, there are two groups.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 The Tantra section of the teaching and the practice aspect of the teaching,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Dhruvdi, in the way called Dhruvdi and Dhruvdi.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Dhruvdi means Tantra section, teachings.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 And that is Mahayoga teaching of the old Tantra section of the Mahayoga,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 including Prima Bhagavat teachings.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And the second one is the practice aspect of the Mahayoga teachings.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So, both are now transmitted by the order transmission lineage.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Order transmission lineage generally is always in the teaching mechanism.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 It contains all three linings.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 It contains the blessing of the mind-to-mind transmission lineage,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 it contains also symbolic transmission lineage,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 and then of course order transmission lineage.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Order transmission lineage from the master to the teacher as teacher,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 to the next student lineage, or from the practitioner to the practitioner,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 and receive the teaching with joy and devotion, determination, courage, commitment,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 and preservation of the teaching.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And that means, what means preservation means?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Keep that practice in heart.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Analyze that realization and share that with others

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 when this time comes already or qualified teaching.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 That is called preservation of teaching.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 You're keeping up the three sides.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 The academic of the scriptural lineage aspect,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 and as well as practice realization aspect of lineage.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Both are the lineage.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Both are so, both are like eyes, like eyes, like two eyes,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 are so equally important to preservation.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 So, these are two linings that are preserved.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And now, this particularly, the standard aspect of teaching is continually,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 there's a long lineage history to continue until now.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 I mean, all those great masters, these who came to debate and continue now,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 that is the standard aspect.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 The practice lineage aspect of this Māyaua teaching is,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 then came, came, this is slightly different.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 And that is in the teaching series,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 that practice aspect of lineage teaching is,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 from the Buddha Vedya kundu zambo, or kundu zambo,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 or the Vedya sattva, transmitted to the,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 what's the rakini known as, 'lady one'.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 The action, action, lady, or lady one.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 And she evened this entirely, that teaching,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 teaching in the channel ground, known as the server subject,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 or core group, core group, group D-R-O-V-E,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I think, core group, group channel ground,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 which is this modern times, or according to put,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 one of them somebody's life will liberate your life story,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 also indicating that's not so part of the Buddha Gaya.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 So it's about five kilo meters, or six kilo meters from the northeast,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I think, it's Buddha Gaya, I think, northeast.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 It's, I don't know exactly how, I think,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 but that direction, there is that really modern time identifying that.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Today is a well-known kind of holy place.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 It was in India, you see, and many times, many playgrounds went there,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 and when I was also in the '60s,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 I had opportunity with my Ganesha teacher, Kaki Patheshara Numbuchi,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 and my father, we all went there to do the playground.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Even we stayed, today they like to spend one night,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 night in the morning, we stayed.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 People said, "Oh, it's not good, it's dangerous to stay there."

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 One night, but then, many folks, we heard, "Stay there, too."

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 So then we stayed there, too.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 One night, I'm there.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Father Numbuchi decided to stay there, so we stayed there, right?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And we went there.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So that day, I didn't find that place as a cold group channel ground places,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 and which is a very strange place.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 In that place, that lady one more hidden,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 there's called Choni Debzitpa,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 and Stupa known as Debzitpa Stupa, and she did it.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And that's my time.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Around that time, eight great masters come together.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 We don't simultaneously, we don't kind of organize,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 simultaneously come together and meditate.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Those eight great masters, they had great vidadharas of the head hirukas,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 and such as, and the names of those eight vidadharas are both is khunkara,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 or, I mean, it's just a number, but it's not some person second order.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 They're all same realizations, all.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 I'm in my vidadharas.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 The khunkara, and the medhichirimitara, and nagarjuna and garbha,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 and parbha hasta, and as well as rhombu and guhi,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 rhombu and guhi, dana santeta, and shende garbha.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 How many now?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Seven?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Seven.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Shende and garbha, and the vamanmata.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Vamanmata.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So those are the eight vidadharas.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And then together, there is also khunkara merma sambha.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 That makes nine vidadharas, nine vidadharas.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 So they all meditated there.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 In that stupa, this is the first stupa in the teachings.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 And during the daytime, it is smokey.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 But it's smokey.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And the nighttime is blended.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So then they thought, what is this?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And they saw the tribular of the eight hiruka teachings

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 within there.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 So they asked Rokos to khunkara rakini,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 the eight vamanmata.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Vamanmata gave that teaching, and she handed over those teachings.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 There is a very special locket, locket, which of all the jewels--

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 locket of all the jewels, locket.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 And that, she didn't give immediately.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 So that is nine.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 There's nine.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 And that is, then, garbha merma sambha received.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 So that is known as center teaching, or the embodiment teaching,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 of all the eight hiruka teachings.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So they received that teaching.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And the teaching says, so each of them received that all teaching,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 their practice, their meditate, actualized, their realization.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 They become the master of the eight hiruka practices.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 That hiruka practice included nine practices, that chinchu.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Chinchu, hiruka practice.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 So those are the half.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Chinchu, so the garbha merma sambha gave this what he received,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 embodiment teaching, to the eight vedalas.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 And from eight vedalas, also garbha merma sambha received,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 they had designated teaching to garbha merma sambha.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 So that way, the garbha merma sambha is holder of the all at limit,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 at head of a chinchu.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 So that's how, really explaining how the at head of a chinchu came

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 to this human world, how they actualized.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And then, when merma merma sambha came to Tibet at century,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 at century, and then one of the fourth teachings, his story said,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 one of his fourth teachings, he gave the at head of a chinchu.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Not in the palace, palace.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 And he gave that chinchu in the Swami chinchu caves.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 And also Swami's role of garbha merma sambha gave that.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Swami has three floors.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Swami monaster has three floors.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And the third floor, top floor garbha merma sambha gave that chinchu.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 So that means that when Swami is completely built,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 and after that garbha merma sambha gave these teachings.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 But many sister said he gave that teaching in the cave of the Swami,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Swami on the mountain for nine students.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 And who were the nine students?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Those are 25, among the 25 disciples, merma merma sambha,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and that nine students.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And again, those nine students are first, maybe just come,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 as it came to some day.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Who was the devoted disciple of merma sambha,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 as well as also lineage holder of merma sambha.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And so both is a chinchu from there.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Second is, again, namqueyjungpo.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 No, namqueyjungpo.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Namqueyjungpo is all here, namqueyjungpo.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 And second is, or third is then garan chowi.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Garan chowi, which has, in here, somewhere has horse head on it.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And he's fully ordained monk too.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Fully ordained monk, one of the first selectest,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 testing monks of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 He said one of the very first monks of the garan chowi.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And third is, and not third, maybe.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Now the next one is, sanghi yishi.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Sanghi yishi, nubchi sanghi yishi.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And third, and I think that's the fourth.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And the fifth one is yishintoya.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Yishintoya, and the sixth one is roma patihishi.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 That is, maybe you don't hear, but it's here.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Roma patihishi.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And next one is lanti pati sankhi.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Lanti pati sankhi.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And the next one is, is vero chana.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Vero chana, I think that's nine, right?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Nine, three, six, eight.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Eight, nine, and now.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Garan chowi, yishintoya.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Oh, nyan yana kumara.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 It's true.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Nyan yana kumara.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Next one is yang yana kumara.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 So that is nine students of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 who received those teachings.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 They practiced at this time, or the practice of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 teaching.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And they all actualized as realization.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And they have mastered with their daras.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Nine with their daras of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 There's eight, nine with their daras of the Indian.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 And nine with their daras of the Tibet.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And these are nine with their daras of the Tibet.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 So those are the how.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 And then teaching is continued.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And when is teaching continued from Tibet?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 And then, as I said yesterday, I think many of you know that.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 That teaching continues to have two principal channels,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 particularly in my teaching.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 And the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 are then continued by discovered or hidden

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 by the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 with many other great masters, teaching just hidden.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And then discovered by then one after another.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 That is the earliest one.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Is around 11th century.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 And known as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 He was the fourth great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 And he continued until now.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 There are so many great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 came one after another until now.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 And almost every of those [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 also had [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 one after another [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 So that is really how the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 teaching continued until now through [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 and as well as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 And now, so particularly this [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And this is regularly teaching that which is discovered

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 by great, again, enlightened beings in the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 known as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 whenever you met your own [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 He was the very well, one of the renowned great masters

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 and a prefected by the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 prefected in the eighth century, the upcoming

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 of the 20th century, century great death

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 of his region, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 prefected.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 prefected.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 He's an exiling time, location, and a place

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 where we will be born, and what he will do during his--

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 when he is a guru, how uphold the teaching

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 some of himself and some of the teachings.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 As in the teaching said, he would this--

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 this emanation will revere the new dharma,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 but at the same time, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 of the old dharma.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 That means all made a great test of teaching while restreting

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 and all that teaching.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 As the exiling guru [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 his whole [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 did that.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 He revere his dharma, his own dharma teaching

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 that which is designated God from guru [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 those teachings.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And then he also glorified, uplifted,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 restrained the lineage of many ancient thetoms.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Thetoms, teachings, both have token.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 So this teaching, what we're today going to--

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 this is the teaching of the--

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 I'm offering empowerment.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 It's teaching-- it is the re-glorified teaching.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Bored all teachings token as one single practices.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 So this is the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] teaching.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And the teaching says, this is the teaching is combined

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 with [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] teaching by nine great thetoms

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 put token as one teaching, one practice learning.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 So this is the ninth thetoms teaching combined token

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 as this teaching.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And this is one of those ninth thetoms, ninth thetoms.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 First one, the eighth thetoms teaching,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 the first great thetoms known as the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 who came around the same time after [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 came to Tibet.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And the teaching says that maybe even he came before the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 but when [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] came, that time he already

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 entered Mahapari in the run.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 came really long time ago, I think 11th century.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 And his [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 known as king of the thetoms.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 He was known as one of the king of thetoms.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 And he discovered all adherubati practices

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 that which he is known as personal [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 He had his own book written, and that teaching,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 he able to discover.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 And the teaching said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 came, came in a human form, and really white mule.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Mule.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Mule.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 At the horse, horse and donkey combination that mule.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Mule.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Yeah, mule.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 White mule.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 And overloaded two luggages with mule,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 and handed it to the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 And when he discovered, looked at that,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 it's the teachings of the entire adherubati.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 That's really very, very long teachings.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 So this is-- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 He was also known as emanation of the king of thetoms.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 The king of thetoms, of course, extended,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 he was great king, ruler.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 But inwardly, he got realization.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 He really achieved it.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Like king and the Buddhist.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 In Buddhism, in many energies, you open king and the Buddhist.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Or in the Shambhala kings.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 They are the rulers, but they are rich in life.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 They become the Buddha.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 And they did all the teachings.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 He dedicated his life in the royal, everything

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 to bring the dharma.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 That's when we had the opportunity to practice the dharma.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 We had reach of the Buddhism in the Tibetan.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 And he also said that so many times, how the Buddha teaching

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Believe me, he danced through so many things.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Open he asks, you read the books of the dharma teaching.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.500
 Open.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.000
 And you'll remember someone predict open,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 or this will happen, this will happen.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Because his kindness and complete thought,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 That came in the 19th century.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 Great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Is the emanation, the combined emanation.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 And the whole of all the lineage teachings of the Buddhism.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000

 So that was art.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 So that is.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Part one is now this [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Second one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 Second one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 That is great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Second great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 Part great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Is then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Northern schools.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 That is also part of his revelation is the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 Pray [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Third one.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 And then the third one.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 And then fourth one is--

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Fourth one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 And which is the emanation of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 And the fifth one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 So those are five great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 And the next one, the sixth one is then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 And the next one is the great [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 And [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Maybe I look here.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.500
 Sorry.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 Fourth one, instead of [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 Which is very famous emanation of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 And very famous [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 And particularly, the very chickens are very popular in the botanical area.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 So that is the fourth, so that on the picked group, first group, I said five.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 And the next one is then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 And then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 And the fourth one is then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 So those are the fourth grade, last grade.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 And all that nine together is called ninth grade [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 And that teaching, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Combined together by his own [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 So this is what really I'm going to offer you the involvement of this.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 And this small tab now, we have that.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 And this fourth one is recorded by his [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Three disciples of his [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Three disciples.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 And then he wrote that there is two versions, larger versions of this teaching,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 as well as a small version, condensed version of teaching.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 The fourth one is recorded by the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 And then as well as his own way to combine together all these technical practices.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 Condensed of that teaching, what we are able to always say that oscillate in English,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 and that is, is, is, then recorded by his Holiness, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 The great master who came also [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 He recorded that teaching.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 And then asked to do it.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 And as his [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 His own [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Combined that program.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 That is how that teaching is.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 So that is really now about the teaching of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 And then I read this teaching from his own [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 Entire, not just me, many, many students,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 I was also part of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 And as well as also I did this involvement teaching

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 from [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 And as a visit, and then I'm offering this teaching.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 So that is really about the stories.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 Story and then involvement is, of course, in reading.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 And the teaching is so important.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 And without the involvement in the practice, when you practice this hardness,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 it is not going to actualize the realization exactly as you wish.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 So therefore, if you would like to do the practice and convince story

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 and the teaching always mention, you should receive the involvement

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 in that class mission.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 And of course, forget with some instructions on that.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Those are really so important.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 Those are really important things.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 So now we go the teaching and a little more.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Then there's some preparations to then go over there

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 and then talk this.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 I can worry about the involvement afterwards.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And so now that is really about the history or the meaning

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 of the teaching of this.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 And now we go to the involvement.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.600
 And before we die, what you do, we do.
