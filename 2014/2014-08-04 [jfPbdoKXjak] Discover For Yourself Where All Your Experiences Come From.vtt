00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Everything, not just only this, but every day our experience, day-to-day lives, day-to-day

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.560
 experiences, not just only day, kind of looking, but even to the momentary looking, to our mind,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 our thought is produced by our mind, person thought, to simple thought, and yesterday we started

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.000
 talking about how that all comes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.260
 If we start looking to the root of this, there's nothing really explanations that can be explained

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.000
 by it. It is all what the teaching says.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.340
 From the emptiness, this is not anything, it's the emptiness of that nature arising all things

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 magically.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.350
 Jai Māyī Chārin's debate is it. If I translate it, it may be right, not maybe correct, but

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 ground is pervasive, it's not at any size.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 From that arising, everything, that's how it's produced. This we can look to our own mind too,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 presenting, where is our mind?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.870
 There's no substantially solid, we can say, yes, hey, this is our mind, but there is our thoughts

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.000
 arising.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.640
 We're talking how our thought, if we look to our own, this person time, we're talking about how our

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 thoughts are arising.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And we, each of us, if we look how our thoughts arising, I don't think we can give any answers.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 How thoughts? Definitely arising. It's truly arising here, we have thoughts. But how that arises?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 If we look to the deep tone, that one fraction before the arising of the thought, if we're trying

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.000
 to find where is that thought arising?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Kind of more practically, more logically, if we start looking, where is that thought? That coming?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Where is our thoughts coming, or my thoughts coming, your thoughts coming, or your thoughts?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 What answer we have? There's nothing. It's not something that we don't know.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 We are not smart enough to know. There's nothing to explain.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.520
 But that's what the Buddha said, speechless, inexpressible, reaching to the natural. Nature is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.000
 beyond conceptions.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.160
 Conservation, for those reasons, great masters, like Thar Karmapa, Raujung Doge, and as well as Y

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.000
ung Ngan.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 Yung Ngan, same voice said, to express of the ultimate meaning of this, even Buddha's tongue is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.000
 short.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 See, there's nothing to explain. Nothing to explain this, nothing this.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Because explain is we're trying to put in conceptions, or even we're trying to put the word in,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 even we don't have conceptions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.140
 We're in enlightened state, we try to put words. What the Buddha used more? Unexpressible, or inex

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.000
pressible, inconceivable.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.270
 Beyond the conceptions, beyond the world and enables. That is what the true nature is. That is not

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.000
 it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 How does the horizon, then sometimes used as magically or mysteries, arise?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 This is not just only thought. If we look to every angle of this world, things, how that came from,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 if we start really looking to the light, such as through the scientist way, quantum physics level,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 everything we look at, looking to dethrone the root of how things are arising.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Arising, I don't see anything that can point. If they point, that's wonderful. Can go more deeper,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 still.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 More deeper, more deeper. Wonderful, that is. It's not something the Buddhism is blocking that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's excellent to find more things. But there is nothing to find concrete, solid existence.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.130
 We're looking at sub-atomic levels. Even hundreds of thousands of divided sub-atomic levels are

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.000
 divided.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 We're looking where that comes from. Where that comes from. It's looking, looking.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 So that means our mind is that, also refined that much, that much.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Soggy and object refined that much, that much. And all these things.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 This is the reality of true nature, inexpressible. That is what.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 If we're trying to go more deeper, more and more things, what Buddha said?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 You're not going further, but you're going back to the consulting world.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Just playing the game. But then the Buddha teach is used as playing the ketties, tales.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Ketties trying to chase the tale of the ketties, going round and round.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Not really going up anything, going round, which is wonderful, maybe.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 It's beautiful playing a game, and all this is nice, enjoying the time. That's it. Good.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So this is what, in the Buddha's hand, don't believe that's the creator outside.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The mind is the creator. That's what the Buddha is.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 It's not believe, according to Buddhism, that is truth. It's not just believing, believing.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 That is correct. That is true. That is accurate. There's nothing more than that.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 This is the one of, again, what Buddha is teaching. Lines, rules. Lines, rules.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Big statement, true statement is truth. Lines are always the first truth.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 It's truth, nothing. Also Buddha didn't make up something, something, new things.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 This is the way it's simple. It is. It is. And the mind is.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then to kind of to just cover those, we went yesterday, all the other days.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It's like how to use the dreams. Who created the dreams?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 The dream is our creations, my creations, my dreams.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And who is that creator? Creator. It's mind.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Mind created dreams. Dreams.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Similarly, this is the big dreams. This is the big dreams.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Big dreams, which is nothing bad. It's beautiful dreams, according to Buddha's teaching.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Only what is incorrect is grasping, clinging. That is incorrect.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 This is not nature. Also it's not nature. It's not truth. It's false. False.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 That's what we capture. It is. Otherwise, dream is nothing wrong.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Dream is beautiful dreams. And for that reason, what Buddha said.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Enlightenment is dream. Nirvana called it all dreams.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Field is dream. It's awful illusions, magical illusions.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 This is our will. And this is the foundation.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 So that is really again kind of retouching to the foundation.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Really, really. From then, now, today, we go to the path.
