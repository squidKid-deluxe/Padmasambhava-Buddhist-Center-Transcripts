00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 Again, we understand how we do the motivation of the joy and the application and the vastness of

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.300
 the motivation of the Bodhisattva, and a period of realization of the true nature of everything as

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.000
 it is.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.780
 And so we activated that, and then I just began like, in a way, to summarize, in a way, to

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.000
 highlight the essence of what we discussed.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.940
 And I also thought to do today, because I know some of the members of the 19th century, I should do

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.000
 some lessons of the chief practice.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.380
 We did those 10 great Thetans, I just covered all those where we taught. So we taught to do that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.000
 also during these morning sessions.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.240
 I thought, possibly, we'd do our practices, and then we got, after we finished the Dharmapala, and

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.990
 then we go up to the library, and then we, I will do that ceremony to blessings or the empowerment

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.000
 or the blessings of those texts, we did prayers and aspirations.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.300
 So that's what we thought. But first, I will do a little bit, kind of, highlight our essence of

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.000
 meaning.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.790
 What we've been discussing this time, we went through the historian of the Nyingma schools of Adv

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.000
aita Buddhism.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Nyingma school has two major lineage, Kamalini and Thermalini.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.190
 Kamalini is a foundation, and Thermalini is the correct level of the ornaments or the essence of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.000
 the Kama teachings.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So Kama is like all those Kama teachings such as Ayurveda teachings and Anu-Yoga teachings.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 And Dhokti teachings, those all are known as Kama teachings. Particularly, those are orally

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.760
 transmitted, explained by the great masters, such as from Master Garab Doge to then, Gaurapayama

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.000
 Sambo, and Vimala Matra, and Verojala, and as well as all the other Indian great masters.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Masters, those teachings are like clarifications of the Buddha teachings.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.410
 Buddha teaching is clay, is nothing that you know. However, Buddha teaching is deep and ocean, deep

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.000
 as ocean, vastness as sky.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.390
 And it's difficult to understand immediately that, because of complexity and infinite meaning of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.000
 those teachings.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.110
 So these great masters, such as all these Indian great masters, they are also predicted by the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 Buddha Chaturman himself,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.740
 who will come and glorify and clarify of the teachings, so they are easy to understand and easy to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.000
 practice.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 So as they did, and those teachings are continually as oral transmission, orally, from Master to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.000
 the teacher, continually came to be, continually,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.430
 without the spoilt in either the college of the teaching, and without the neglect, and everyone

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.000
 practices.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.490
 All these masters practice meditating, they observe the meaning to the heart, and they become as

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.000
 great masters.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 They are not just born as great masters, they practice meditating, actualized.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.250
 So that means, what they actualize? They are actualized of the complete ultimate meaning of the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.000
 loving kindness, the conviction,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.980
 versatile, and free from the ego-clinging, self-important, self-centered mind, and negative

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 emotions.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.510
 That's what they really remove. In a river, the ultimate goal or ultimate calling of the true

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.000
 nature,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 exactly as it is, as Buddha Chaturmani discovered, they discovered.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 In the Buddha teachings, we all know, in the Buddha Chaturmani said, everyone has the same nature.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.540
 There is no really difference at all. No matter what you are there, regardless of whatever the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.000
 situation and circumstances we go through,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.950
 but nature is the same. If they walked hard for them to discover their nature, according the right

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.000
 correct way,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.310
 they will discover and become what the Buddha has led me. That's what the gracious teacher, Buddha

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.000
 Chaturmani said.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.770
 So this great master, who was practicing the practice and meditating, they actualized that religion

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.000
.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And that lineage teaching, the lineage teaching of loving kindness and compassion,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 like the stainless teaching, continuity and disturbance, came there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.350
 And then, when it came to Tibet, and the gurupi was more clarified or more kind of centralized

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.000
 essence of that teaching.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And those teachings, more easy to practice, those are known as dharma teachings.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Very easy, simple, more direct and more powerful practice is conducive to easy practicing.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And that is known as dharma teaching.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.430
 And Gurupi and Masambha gave those teachings at the time of the 8th century, with all the disciple

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.000
 students,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 they practiced and meditated, but then, thinking of the future generations,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 and then Gurupi and Masambha, those are hidden, along with the wisdom and recognition, so it does.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Very hidden that teaching, then known as three extra lineages, as we went through those,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 and that is not designated and professed, professed lineages.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 So that means, this means that all the great masters, practicing, who were the student of Gurupi

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 and Masambha,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 and the Boman Matara, great master, Shandara Chaka, they are like bodhisattva, great bodhisattva.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 They are completely determined to benefit, to uphold the teachings of benefit for all living beings

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.000
,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 and uphold the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni and Vediana teachings.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Therefore, they, Gurupi and Masambha, designated or enthroned, enthroned and professed.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 That is known as lineage, lineage of the professed and designated.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 When that happened, Gurupi and Masambha were given special blessings,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 and the empowerment that happened, that is known as the empowerment and the blessing lineages.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And then, known as after that happened,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.420
 and then they handed the teaching to Vakini and Dharmapala, not just only that, to all those

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.000
 practitioners,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 who received that teaching, he handed that to them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.670
 So that means what? Acknowledge it, acknowledge it then, and profess who will be, when you will

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.000
 come,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 when you will come in the future, what you will do, where you will be,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 what is that time, your name, and all that complete prophecy.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And then bless it. And then, as well as empowerment.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Empowerment, that means the empowerment of that teachings.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And then, they, what they did, are known as handed over the teachings.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Handed over teaching with full trustness.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And they received that teachings complete with joy and a devotional heart,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 and they are going to really carry that on.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 At the same time, Dharmapala and Dhakini are also there,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 and they received, and they are going to protect that teachings.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 So that whole thing is, is, happened at that time.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And not just only that time, then also when they bombed,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 as Gurugam Masambhav predicted, they bombed, or when they take the birth.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And that time also that happened, all that three too.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Not just only that time happened, it's not happened.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 When they got all that lineage teaching,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 according to the Buddha teaching and the Gurugam Masambhav teaching,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 it preserved and kept in their primordial wisdom status.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 The ultimate state of the primordial wisdom.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And they kept. The primordial wisdom is the one way, is lectureical lock it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Lock it. It all preserved that.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And it re-activated that.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Re-activated by the Gurugam Masambhav in the wisdom Dhakini Shintoja,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 and it re-activated by their individuals too.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 To that. This is known as then, aspiration break.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 For those reasons, in the Tenma teaching,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 offering said, maturing the aspirations

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 and waking up their karmic connections.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Waking up the karmic connections.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Because it's, it's all that is matured.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 When we talking about the aspirations, in general the Buddha teaching,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 there is ten aspirations of the great bodhisattvas.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 All the bodhisattvas. These ten aspirations.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 They always keep that aspirations.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Aspirations, in other words, may be prayers.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 They put wish forward, putting wish forward.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 These prayers, on this wish forward,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 putting forward the wish forward.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Power of aspirations.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 First is, always be praying, always be serviced in the Buddha.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Serviced of the Buddha.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 So that means all the enlightenment.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 That means may I be always serviced to the Buddha.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 The second aspiration is, may I always uphold the teachings.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And the third aspiration, pray, is,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 may I able to perform the physical emanation as is needed

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 to benefit all the beings.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Fourth aspiration, pray,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 may I able to travel or go different places

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 to receive and activate the teaching practices and meditations.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And fifth aspiration, pray,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 may I perform all the six parameter practices,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 all the ten parameter practices, may I perform.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 And sixth phrase, aspiration,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 may I always benefit you to send in the beings.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Make sure they are Buddha nature.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 That means bring out their love, bring out their compassion,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 bring out of their courage and commitment.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 May I able to bring them.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And seventh is,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 may I have always benefited to environmental levels.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Operify the universe, the world, the environment.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 And then, may I always be able to be,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 or may I always be casual and simple as other sentient beings.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 All the sentient beings that you are going to walk and benefit,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 have and support.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 So may I always be like them,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 not just standing up to something, kind of something different ways.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 May I always be that way.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And the ninth aspiration is,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 whatever I do, I have meaningful, meaningful activities, meaningful benefits.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So whatever I do, it benefited to the beings

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 and benefited to the meaningful purposes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And always fruitful, whatever we do.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Not just the kind who lost them.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 And then finally, all that aspiration, may I achieve enlightenment,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 become Buddha, as well as also everyone get enlightenment.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Those are known as ten great aspiration prayers of the Bodhisattvas.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Bodhisattvas.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 That is what these great datums, great masters,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 great Bodhisattvas put forward that wish,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 that prayer, in the presence of Bhagavad-Bhagavatam Sambho,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 and most of the Dakinis in Georgia,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 and in Bodhisattva, everywhere.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Generally, always the teaching said,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 not just have to be physical, some of the experience,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 you are activating good heart.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 This is all good heart.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 This is totally authentic of loving kindness,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 compassion, and the egolessness statement.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 That's what I like to follow.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 For example, one insight, I'm always harvesting the Buddhas.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 The activity of the Bodhisattva mind

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 never be displeased in any enlightened beings.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Everything is lined up exactly what the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas did,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 or what they're doing, or what they will do.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 May I line up there to benefit for all the living beings?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And then, but also said, I'll hold the teachings.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 What are the teachings, generally, when talking?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 I hold the teachings, there are two teachings, not us.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 The scriptural teachings, the realization of the meaning teachings,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 scriptural teachings, according to Bodhisattva,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 or Bodhisattva teachings, six, those three, or sorry,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 three basket teachings, vinaya teachings,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 suttara teachings, abhidhana teachings,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 all the nayanana teachings, all eighty-four thousand standards of the teachings,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 those are all known as scriptural teaching or teaching on the book poems.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 To uphold that, keeping up that is called scriptural teachings,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and they debate longer truths.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And then, not just holding that books,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 but then the second is the meaning of that teaching,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 applying that to one's own self,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 not just that you can't really hold that books as like honor shares,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 but practicing that into heart.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And what have been put the practices, what are those teachings?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 You all know, it's called three extraordinary practices,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 practicing on the moralities, practicing on the concentricers,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 practicing on the wisdoms, and the love, and compassion,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 that is observed in the heart.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 That is actually the meaning of the entire Bodha teaching.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Whether it's Mahayana, whether it's the basic Bodhisattva teaching,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 or whether it's vinayana teaching, or whether it's zogki teaching,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 that it conveys, condenses all the teachings in that status,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 or practices, all that status.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Morality, concentration, anniversities.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Observing the inner heart, then plus all that what I said listed,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 all that ten aspirations.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So they, these great thetans, not just a regular sense of means,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 or by chance they can become that.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Truly they designated the met that commitment,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 they put that aspirations.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 So every time they throw out the lifetimes, or throw out the days,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 and put only that goal.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 What they practice, what they uphold,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 that's what they benefited from sending things.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 So therefore, these teachings are also when we went through the teaching,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 how they're so humble, so humble, so humane.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And we're full of, even though they have extra only relaxation,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 but their love and their devotions, humility.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 I mean, so uncreatable.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Many people's kind of, if that kind of realization,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 some things, the episode normal, they can get errors.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 They think some spirits, they kind of act that I'm the like,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 maybe they're going to say I'm the guru of him or someone,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 or the Buddha, they're going to claim all those things.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 I'm directly connected to the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 I'm there claiming that, announcing that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 No, it's so humble, so simple, so daunted up,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 following every systems of the teachings in the relative truth,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 exactly what it should do.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Avoiding all the negative activities,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 performing all the beneficial activities.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And practicing that, that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 And absolutely, their realization is vast as sky,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 as deep as the ocean, and fearlessness.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 They're not hesitating.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 They're not kind of lingering every direction.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Because they don't have ego clean.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 They don't have any kind of emotion connected.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Their determination, their courage, their commitment.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 They understand it's so firm, so strong,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 as like solid mountains, unshackles.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 This is what we were discussed this time.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 We went footsteps, retold all those teachings.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 In a way, already we're connected to these great thetums

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 or the teachings of Gurbel and Sama,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 but really activated, renewed.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And also we can brighten our understanding,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 realization of what thetum means.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Thetum means what is thetums.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Thetums.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 And so that's what really we went.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And I'm very happy that we had that opportunity to discuss.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And again, thank you very much, everyone,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 to participate, and we talk with it,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 and kind of feel these blessings of the thetums.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 So now we do the practices as we do up and down.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And then after that, as I said,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 we do the Vedic Lai practices and Dharma Palai.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And yesterday, before that,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 we see with the blessings from--

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 check the involvement from the book, Vedic Lai.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And then we go up to the library,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 and then I do the ceremony,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 and there is the blessings of the--

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 of the--the blessings of the teachers.
