00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.310
 Good morning, good morning everyone, good morning, good morning, good morning. And I guess I want

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.000
 to say again, happy new year in the Tuvvedi language we call...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:34.410
 In the Tuvvedi we call... that means... So I just want to say... Thank you everyone. And of course,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.000
 this country is one of the greatest countries in the world.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 And there is so many opportunities, chance to celebrate a lot of new years, according to different

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.000
 traditions. So it's just wonderful, really wonderful.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.310
 And today we are celebrating another new year. And according to the building in the condo, marks

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.000
 with very special event of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.810
 That Buddha Shakyamuni reached enlightenment, after he reached enlightenment, and then he performed

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 by the request of so many devoted students and sangha members and male and females.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And of course, he performed extraordinary activity that expressed his realization, his achievement.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 So please show us some kind of extraordinary... Otherwise Buddha was so humble and simple, going

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.000
 with his students and moving.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.830
 Always just the same as other regular students, same thing, but they really want to see something

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.000
 extraordinary that everybody kind of show this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 So by the request of that, and then as well as also some situation, even to take places.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 So Buddha performed known as miraculous activities. So prepare me this, according to very Buddhism,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.000
 that begins three days ago, the day one, the lunar calendar.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.300
 And then continually to this full moon is a very special day. So all those combined, in the way we

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.570
 celebrate all of those, to very new year, and as well as a miracle activity of the Buddha Shakyam

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.000
uni.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.210
 According to very Buddhism, any event, miracle activities, or any meditually activities that we are

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.000
 doing this month, will be multiplied.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.670
 Multiple light, hundred thousand times, because of power of the Buddha Shakyamuni, and not just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.000
 only Buddha's power, but as well as also Buddha showed this event.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.760
 On these days, there is a special kind of time occurring, very special time occurring, and so that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.000
 time Buddha also performed that ceremony.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.250
 So the combination of the Buddha's blessings, and actually naturally taking kind of timing, what

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.000
 will happen, all combined together, we also swing with that, kind of in a way, surfing with that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.470
 Use that, and then I think it really ignited our also meditually activities, more powerful, more

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.000
 effective to ourself, to others.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 So with those thought, anything that we can do, meditually activities, that means to benefit the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.460
 beings, to benefit the beings, and happiness, the cause of happiness, anything that we can really

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.000
 make that, those are known as meditually activities.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So today, we do this again with celebration, and as conjunction with Buddha's miracle activities.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, and welcome everyone. Thank you so much.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And now we do practice. Again, we open our prayer booklet, we do practice on the Gurupa Masambha

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 and the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And then we do the short part of practices, and then we do short also dharma part of practices.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Those are what we do.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And so please open your page one in this.
