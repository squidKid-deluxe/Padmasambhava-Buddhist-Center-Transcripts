00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 Thank you so much for everyone. Welcome. Again, I would like to say a good "APAN" and welcome

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.000
 everyone. Thank you very much for making time and participating with our session of this practice

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 during these times. Thank you so much for everyone. Welcome.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 Again, I'm going to talk through the words about the teachings of the Course-Generated

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.090
 Kṛṣṇa Buddha Shatyamuni. Particularly, it is teaching from the Bhakti-Zhudu Rinpoche. It's

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.370
 like advice to 14 students, that we all have, I guess you all have that focus. So we're going

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 through this, that teaching.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.350
 And this teaching is now on the sixth line of that page, which is discussing or explaining and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.000
 reminding us of the importance of the Three Jewels.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.070
 These Three Jewels, of course, we all know, is Buddha, Dharma and Sangha in Buddhism. Those are the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 Three Jewels, known as, spiritually, actually, the Three Jewels. As I said the other day, they are

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.000
 more than Jewels, more than the precious.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 They are supreme, real, precious. They are granted all the wishes of the Jew in peace, happiness,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.000
 for ourselves, for all the beings, forever. That is what these Three Jewels are.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 It is not just a jewel. It is supreme, real jewel. Truly, though it is, the only jewel is the ornam

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.000
ents of God, saints, beings or physical beings, non-human beings.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 Everyone honors because it is the treasure and the jewel of every living beings, because it is the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.000
 essence, the nature of everyone.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 That Buddha is pointing out, revealing us to, so that we can glorify, cherish and enjoy with this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 That's what really this jewel is.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 Now, among that jewel, first is Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Those are the Three Jewels. I take

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dharma, I take refuge in the Sanghas.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 So, we went really about the Buddha. Today, I talk really about Dharma. Now, Dharma is the Sanskrit

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.000
 word. It has this Dharma word used for about ten different meanings.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.610
 It is. It can be used for ten different names, about ten. Among that, this is known as Dhambuchud

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.000
 in it a bit.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.030
 And if I translate that into English, holy Dharma. This is holy Dharma, not just regular Dharma,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.000
 Dharma.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It is holy, supreme jewel as I am talking. That is really Dharma. So, we have made Dharma now.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.360
 It has two meanings, the word that meaning. It has meaning of correcting, it has meaning of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000
 protecting.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 So, what Dharma has two, holy Dharma has two. Correcting and protecting.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.050
 What means correcting? Correcting from the old habit pattern. That is not good for me, not good for

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.000
 others.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 From protecting from that old unhealthy, unwholesome habit patterns.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:29.880
 Who is? One who apply that, he protects us from that. We will be protected from the unhealthy, unwh

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.000
olesome habit patterns.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So, that. And then, what is protecting? Protecting all the difficulties, the troubles of anything

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 that we face in the samsara.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.680
 It will protect us. How? It is protected with sub-drivenment of the skills, courage and a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.000
 commitment.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.050
 And perseverance with joy and every hit. At the same time, the blessings of the Buddhas, such as

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.000
 Buddha, Shakyamuni, Gaurav and Masambhava,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:22.950
 will also enter easily to our mind streams. Because we are preventing our old habit pattern, we are

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.000
 going to hurt us.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 We are going to, which are hurting us, which are hurting others.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Who is? Who created the old habit patterns? Nobody else. It is one's own creations.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.910
 Many times in the samsara, we are old samsara beings, creating more trouble by our own self than

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.000
 others.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 We create it. Many times knowingly, many times unknowingly.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 That's why in the teaching of the great masters in the Gautama schools, in the 7th training of the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 mind practice said,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 "You are, can be enemy of your own self." You can be enemy of your own self.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.010
 Or the Buddha Shakyamuni, actually. Great teachers, Buddha Shakyamuni said, "You can be enemy to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.000
 your own self."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Same time, you can protect, go to your own self.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.410
 So ultimately, it's relying with us, how we like to protect ourselves, or how we like to damage

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.000
 ourselves.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Fundamentally speaking, we already hurt our self by trouble-loving, deluded ego clankings.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 We are already that way. But additionally, we add so many things.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Thinking is good for, but turn is always a wrong mistake.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 We hurt each other, our self, more than enemy.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 We miniaturize, we think the enemy is hurting.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 But those actually compare with how much we, our own self, do. It's a practice.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Practice, really we do.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And therefore, this teaching, dharma, will protect from that old habit patterns.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 So therefore, what is it need to be? "Chu-jo." "Chu" and "jo."

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 "Chu" means from old habit is correct us back to our self.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Who is correct? Buddha will help us, show us how to do, but we have to apply.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 We should apply with our mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 All mindfulness, that, if we apply, that is how we correct our self.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Then you will protect. So that is the general meaning of dharma.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Now when we talk about dharma now, about dharma, only dharma.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Now I am making the whole meaning of dharma.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Now we talk about dharma. dharma can be divided into three.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Nature or identity and describe all the divisions and as well as benefit of the teaching.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 And nature of dharma is cessation and path.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Path and cessation are the nature or the identity of dharma.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Now what that means? Cessation. What that means? Path.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Path is what we are going to apply.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 When we are following, for example, Buddha gave the teaching.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Gurubhema samav gave the teaching when we have teach.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 We read. Teachers will explain. When we start applying, that is known as following the path.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 That is following the path.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 When we do that, somebody will understand realization according to our capabilities or readiness.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 That is known as realization or the cessation.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 What means cessation? What is ceased?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It is the old habit dependence.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Maybe not ceased completely, but it is reducing.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 It is reducing somebody, our old habit dependence according to our effort, courage and commitment.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So it is seizing the old habit dependence, simple ritual,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 and advancing the realization as metaphor of the path.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 This path is not outside, rolled apart.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 It is part of the inner realization, inner development journey.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 That is part, named as metaphor.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 So we will advance. When we begin to advance,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 at that time spontaneously it is reducing the habit dependence.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 And cause of old habit dependence is some degree of the ego clinging.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And also maybe attachment, grasping, clinging, anger, jealous,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 hating thought, a little bit reducing, accordingly it is going down.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 And advancing, then what will we feel with that habit?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 We feel more calmer, more peaceful, more patience, more tolerance, more openness.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Because old will shine naturally, old comes, spontaneously.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 We don't have to make effort to get peaceful,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 or to reach for more calm, or calmer, or more kind of openness.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 When we put the practice, practice begin, it is old comes.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 As the sun light shines, shines, that immediately darkness goes away,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 immediately according to the light, darkness goes away.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 At that moment, same time, all the beautiful birds start singing,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 singing, and the lot of stars start blooming.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And all that happens, same time.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 It's not something that has to make effort, these things.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 That is what is known as the world of darkness.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 So that is the nature of darkness.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Then, if we advance continuously, then that is known as the five parts, or ten rooms.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Each time you got the realization of the first part, second part, third part, fourth part,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 and fifth part, realizations.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Those are realizations. Another name, it is cessation status.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 You reach it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 At the same time, each time, you deepen your realization, understand.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 At the same time, we put a fine, clear way, old, negative release.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 We told any trace. Similar example, as sunlight comes, dark goes away.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 There is no trace of the dark, where it's only.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 You just serpentine it. That is how it is.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 So that is really about the nature or identity of the darkness.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Now, we told the division of the darkness.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Darkness is divided into two groups.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Those are known as, in it's way, long-chu, tok-chu, long-chu, tok-chu.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And that long-chu, as I translated, is scriptures,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 or in other words, teaching of the greatest teacher, Bodhachathamali.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And tok-chu is the meaning of that teaching.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 That teaching is the meaning of the teaching of the Bodhachathamali, the meaning.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 So one is mo, wo, the meaning statement.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Statement. And yes, teaching.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 But the meaning is tok-chu.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 If I translated that into English, realization, understanding.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 When you read the book of the Buddha teaching, first you read,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 but then you really contemplate on that, you will catch some meaning.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 So when you read and contemplate and analyze, that is known as scripture.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 When you catch some meaning, all that means this, this kind of absorbed heart.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 It rented our heart. That is the realization, understanding.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So that is kind of a very simple way to explain of this long-chu, tok-chu.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And again, long-chu is the scripture, or the statement, or the teaching,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Bodhachathamali is a realization, understanding.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Catch the meaning from the teaching, teaching.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 So those are two teachings.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 How? Now, what are those post-scripture teachings, statement teachings?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Generally, Buddha gives according to so many teachings.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 That means when Buddha become the Enlightenment, age 35,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 and entered Mahafari Nirvana around age 81, I can't even say.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 So over 45 years, Buddha gave a lot of teachings.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 All these teachings are, it is, teachings on the non-violence,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 teachings on the peace, teachings on the harmonious,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 teachings on the respect and appreciation to all living beings,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 and her teachings on how to respect the environment, and all ones.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Not just only the we see things, but even we don't see.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 In Buddhism, when the Greek teacher Buddha said,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 "There could be many beings you can be, you have to respect, appreciate."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 We all live in this samsara.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 In a way, we are citizens of the samsara.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 In the samsara, there is no one less unhappiness,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 and violence, sadness, sufferance.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Everyone has one desire, peace, happiness, fulfillment.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 That is the same desire.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 So therefore, respect and appreciation to every level,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 that's what the Indian teaching said.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 That's what the teaching is.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So Buddha gave a variety of teachings.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Those are named, every bigger one in the teaching,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 what I said, 84,000 different teachings.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Those 84,000 teachings are divided into four groups.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 And 24,000, no, sorry, 21,000 teachings,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 particularly highlight how to subdue the attachments,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 how to subdue the attachment, or how to transform the attachment.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 21,000 teachings are principally connected,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 how to subdue the anger.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And 21,000 teachings about how to subdue or despair,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 or not just subdue, how to purify.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 I should say purify, not subdue, how to purify by ignorance.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And 21,000 teachings, to purify, all target those emotions.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Those emotions mean attachment, anger, jealous.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 So those are 84,000 teachings, but they kind of really highlight them.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Then that's all teaching can be summarized into 12 excellent teachings.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 And I'm not going to listen to those 12 excellent teachings.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 If you like to know those listed names,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 you can look to the many resources and as well as the Googles.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 I'm not joking, it's true, I'm sure it's there.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 So that I won't go those numbers there.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And I know many, we are not so kind of keen of the many numbers,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 except our lotus, and you like the numbers.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 But otherwise we are not so keen on the number, so I won't go through that.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 And then that whole 12 excellent teachings can be summarized into renowned,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 that we've all heard so many times, three basket teachings.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Three basket teachings.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 These three basket teachings that I'm going to talk about is Vinaya, Basket of Vinaya,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Basket of the Sutra, and Basket of the Abhidham.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 So those are the three basket teachings.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Why he uses basket teachings?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Because Vinaya is not just a Vinaya only teaching,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 it contains a variety of tools to discover our inner nature

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 and purify the obscurations, negative emotions.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 And Vinaya is, so that is really Vinaya.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And what means Vinaya?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Vinaya means Sanskrit word, translated into Tibet, Dhruva,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 means discipline, discipline teaching.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Displaying the word, the unwholesome activity of the body,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 the unwholesome activity of the speech,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 that is really the Vinaya teachings on how to display it.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 So it's magenta, peaceful. And so that means, if we summarize this, what is teaching?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 That is, principally, teachings on ethics and conduct.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Those are known as teachings, mainly.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 But this is not just only ethics and conduct.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 It has teachings of all other things, all other.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 And what that means, actually, all other.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And actually, in the teaching, all three basket teachings

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 can be the essence of all that is summarized

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 or can be understood, three principle meanings.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 The morality, concentration, wisdom, that is really what it is.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 So Vinaya teaching is principally teaching highlighted

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 of the ethics of the morality, but it has teachings on the concentrators.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 It has teachings on the Muslims.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 So therefore, it is a rich basket that starts with the discipline of the moralities.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Morality in Sanskrit is chilam. Chilam translated into English, I think.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Morality in a debate is chitam. Chitam means cool.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 We have a very gentle manner that is cool guys and cool girls.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Truly gentle, peaceful. Wow, that's really cool and so beautiful.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 So special. That can be, that individually can be ornamented

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 or the beauty of every society, wherever you go.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Calm, peaceful, relaxed, openness.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Same time, smart, practical, with full of common sense.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 That is the one that morality is, or chilam brings that.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So that is really about Vinaya.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Suttara, next basket of teaching is suttara.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Suttara means the first word translated into a debate.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Ancient time, those great emanation, fast letters in the adseki.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Bodhi means condensate.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 What is condensate in a way? It is condensate teaching

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 or it is the focal point of teaching on how to concentrate on the mind.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 So that's it. First is Vinaya teaching.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 It deals with more kind of external activities,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 with the principal activity of the body, activity of the speech,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 when you become gentle and calm.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Now you have to deal with the fundamental, the various source.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 The principal is the mind, so the mind has to be calm, the mind has to be peaceful.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Then really it brings you, perfect.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Perfect, from inside and from outside, or from outside to inside, every day complete.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Our body is cool, our speech is cool,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 our mind has become calm and peaceful, and that is the ultimate cause.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Then it becomes, so it tells what is called suttara.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 But suttara teaching is not just only how to concentrate on the mind,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 it tells also, also, moralities.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It tells, tells in the wisdom, teaching.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 So it's a combined package, combined teaching.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Therefore it's called basket teaching.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 It's very complete teaching.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 It's completely like megavitam, it's completely total,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 total energy bars of the two, discover that realization.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 So that is what really is suttara teaching.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And then now abhidhana, abhidhana is, is, is sanskri-bho.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 In it, in it, it is translated as mungpa, mungpa.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 If it is translated that in English, in English,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 then sing the pranamana exactly as it is.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Or not maybe in pranamana, sing exactly as it is.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Sing in the direct perception status.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Sing exactly as it is.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 And every time, later, there are more kind of what that means.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 It's a wisdom.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Wisdom does it clearly everything as it is.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Nothing is highly stated, not understated,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 exactly, simple, direct, whatever it is.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Sing that, that is a wisdom.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Sing truth is supreme.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 There is nothing higher, better to the knowledge

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 than is not truth as it is, whatever it is.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 So is this teaching explaining exactly related truth as it is,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 and absolute truth as it is.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Again, greatest teacher, the compassion, wise teacher,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni, to how, how to capitalize or capitalize

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 or capture, capture the whole phenomenon

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 to bring the perfect understanding.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 He sees true truths, related truth and absolute truth.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 So, so marvelous, really, so marvelous,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 to bring exactly the everything as it is.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Then, related truth, what he said,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 all is interdependent coordination.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 All is connected.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Nothing is coming or producing or going to happen

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 without cause and conditions.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 That cause and conditions exactly line up with resolved problems

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 or with caused problems.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 True or not, we can all think,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 is there anything that came, came in our direct perception

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 without the cause and conditions?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Direct perception, valid cognitions.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Anything came? No.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Nothing is produced without cause and conditions.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 So that is the relative truth where things are happening.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And this relative truth, nature is empty.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Therefore, therefore, everything is changing, moving, moving.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Translucent status.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 This translucent status is not just a fancy word

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 usually in the philosophy of terminology.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Reality, it is.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Everything is like dream, translucent status.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Then, the nature of that is emptiness or infinite freedom.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 It is, if I use the modern terminology,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 it comes from physics, nature.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 That is true, again.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 That is known as in the Buddha's teaching, absolute truth.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 That nature is not just some are that nature and some are not,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 but entirely everything in that nature status, that status.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Whether it is subject, whether it is object.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 That is all.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 There is nothing is not in that status.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 The great, infinite, great emptiness,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 great freedom, openness status.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 You have to be thinking that.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 That is Abhidhamma teaching.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 But Abhidhamma is also not just only that.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 It has also teachings on morality, teachings on concentration.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 So therefore, it is a basket of Abhidhamma teachings.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 So those are like scripture teachings.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Now, this realization teaching.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Realization or the meaning teaching of these three baskets,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I already explained to you, I already said.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Those realization teaching or the meaning of the teaching,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 principle meaning of the Vinaya teaching is morality.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 That is realization.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 That is what we have to practice there.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 We have to practice.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 It is not just an intellectual character.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 We have to keep up that.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 That is realization or practice.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And the principle meaning of the suttara is concentration.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Not just read the suttara.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 We have to activate that meaning in our heart.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 So meditating.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 That is realization.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 That is the meaning.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 You are observing that in the heart.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And then, Abhidhamma, principle meaning of the Abhidhamma,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 is a wisdom.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And wisdom is then as is said.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 What is the level of truth, absolute truth,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 is all in that great state of the interdependent or coordination,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 all the great emptiness stages.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Again, not just the intellectual understanding.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 And meditate on that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 If we meditate on that,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 one is called, known as one japaramatas.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Mademakas.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Mahamudas.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Zukti teachings.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Those all is known as the wisdom practices.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Wisdom practices.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 So that is the scripture.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 So that is the realization.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 What I said, divided, dharma can be divided into two.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 True.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And it is the scripture and the realization.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And the scripture teaching, what the Buddha told,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 those three basket teaching have summarized all.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 That is the scripture teaching,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 what the gracious teacher, Buddha, taught.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 And then, the meaning of that is three extra-word trainings.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Morality.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Concentrations.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And wisdom practices.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 That is the scriptural, sorry, realization teachings.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 That is the scriptural teaching.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Also can be divided in other two ways.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Those are known as the scripture teaching by the Buddha Khatya Munims

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 and the scripture teaching by the great masters,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 the qualified masters,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 such as Nagar Jhunas, Masu Vaidu, Asengas, Alia Devas,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 and the great master Shaita Vatras.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Remember, some of their teachings

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 are the equivalent of the teaching of the great teacher Buddha, Shaita Munims,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 because their teachings are explaining totally, perfectly,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 clearly, unmistakably, as Buddha taught.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 So therefore, those teachings are known as Shastra in Sanskrit,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 but Temptu in it a bit, Temptu, Vaidu.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 That is really, that is what the scripture or the teaching can be divided,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 and the scripture teaching of the Buddha,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 scripture teaching by those great masters.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 The meaning is the same.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Morality, concentration, and wisdom.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 That is what the teaching itself is.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 So, that is my brief talk for today about dharma.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And so, again, thank you very much, everyone,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 and therefore, for participating.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And thank you, okay, thank you, everyone.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Thank you, okay, thank you.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Now we do again, talk meditation,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 and then we're going to continue in Dakini ceremony.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Dakini ceremony.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And we did strenuous practices at you all, all participating.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.
