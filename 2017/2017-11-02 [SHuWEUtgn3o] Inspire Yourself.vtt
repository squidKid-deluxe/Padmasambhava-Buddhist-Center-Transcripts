 "Even they come before they go to bed, in a way, reflectively, to their day-long practices.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.470
 If they did really good practices, feel good, they are so happy. They appreciate it. Why? They're

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.260
 quite good.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.760
 By the blessings of the Buddhas and all three Yule and Buddhas, Modi, Sattva, and every

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.440
 enlightenment, may I do even better tomorrow.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.140
 Please, I've dedicated that melody for all the sentient beings.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.580
 As a fire, our self, not joy and appreciation, is something to our own, outside only.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.180
 Joy and appreciation, our self, and joy and appreciation to the others, but they're not good.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.140
 That joy and appreciation is what? It's free from arrogance, free from anger. That is all we know.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:58.320
 Again, traders are still welcoming. Therefore, even Buddha appreciates shedding to the Charisms,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.140
 and our Shari put their children.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 So here, good, good. What that also and the teachings said, good means the Exhaly of Charism, what

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 you said spoke, is good.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 Meaning level good, vocabulary level good, everything good.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 So that means, meaning is good, vocabulary level is good.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 Meaning is a performed teaching of the Pandya Paravada, Pandya Paravada.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 That also indicates all the Pandya Paravas, six paravada practices that you really perform.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.300
 So performed level is good, and vastness level is great, because then this will bring all the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.140
 qualities, vastness of qualities, of the realization, one after another.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 How wonderful, how beautiful, so good and good, good.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 And then next one is the Sun.
