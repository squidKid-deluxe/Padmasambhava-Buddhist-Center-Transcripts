00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.630
 I am renewing the rafuddi vows and bodhisattva vows. In order to do that, I think what we do first,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:18.390
 we join these lines, this may be stopped, up to the middle of this page, 65, one time, and then we

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.440
 will do get out, we will do 3-4 sessions, I mean you will get out, do 3-4 sessions, I will just

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.000
 follow, I will do.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 While I am sitting here, I will do the kind of mudra of those 4 stations, but you will get up

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.000
 unless you have some troubles with these, otherwise you will get up and do 3-4 stations.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.720
 And this time, again, we are going to fill the strong presence of the great teacher, Buddha Shatyam

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.420
uni, right in front of our sky, sitting with various postures and on the lines thrown, lot of sudden

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.000
 moon, as always in the teaching making.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And Buddha is totally enlightening, which means, pre-pro all the negative videos, two obscurations,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 emotional obscurations, and knowledge obscurations, all obscurations of all those negative videos,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.730
 such as anger, jealous, head and toes, and obscurations of the grasping, clinging, and that was

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.000
 completely gone.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And that means, also completely free from the ego clinging in the subway and border.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 Then what is Buddha? Buddha is totally embodiment of true love, true compassion, and true

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 resistance.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.980
 And Buddha is also a rainbow body of love and compassion, and living Buddha right now, and really

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.000
 feel that strongly.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 In the teaching he said, as you feel the power of the Buddhas with confidence in and prone to you,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.000
 Buddha will be right there, because Buddha don't have the distance of the time and space.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Space, only time and space is divided by our duality mind. Reality level, everything is open.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.650
 In one moment, instantly, as we think truly with the confidence and devotion, Buddha will be right

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.000
 in front of us.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.520
 Really feel that, strongly, without a doubt and hesitation, intellectual thoughts, those all are

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.000
 handed as obstacles.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.520
 This time feel strongly presence of Buddha as living Buddha, our great teacher, our great guidance,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.000
 our great product, our great example story,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 our great role model of love and compassion, courage and commitment, and of the benefit of all

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.000
 beings and helping all beings.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That great teacher showed us the teaching, which is the teaching that we practice and meditate.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 When we read the teaching, it rains our air, and it rains our heart.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 It's so beautiful. As we joined, the suttur of three jewels recollected, it's so perfect, so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.000
 beautiful, so moderate, so subtle, so common sense,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 full of common sense, drawn to the earth. Really, teaching is so perfect.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.510
 Therefore, it says teaching is good at the beginning, when we read, when we're studying and reading

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.000
 is good,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 when we're also teaching second time is teaching is good, because when we're contemplating and

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 thinking of the meaning

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 and comparing with intellectually, also is good. There's no errors or mistakes, really.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.520
 And then, when teaching is thought good, because when we meditate and practice, that brings the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.000
 result as teaching means.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Really, we put your effort and courage and commitment, so teaching is so beautiful.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.800
 And that teaching, that great teacher is right here. And that teacher is also not just one

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.000
 individual Buddha.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.030
 The Buddhas of all the three terms, ten directions, every enlightening, every your lineage master,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.000
 teachers came together from this Buddha.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And our great master Mohan Mohan said in teaching that we do practice always, the Buddha Sadhana.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.950
 In this time, in this land, or in this land, in this time, whatever light we follow is in the light

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.000
 of the Buddha, your light, Buddha's light.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.550
 What if we follow? Whether it is the Theravada teaching, Sutra Mahayana teaching, Vaidhayana

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.000
 teaching, Dzokhi teaching,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 or Anathatra teaching, Aotland teaching, is all teaching with the Buddha.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 The great master, Guru Pramasambhava, also mentioned, follow the teaching of the Buddha.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 He said, he followed his, Buddha's teaching. Read Guru Pramasambhava teaching.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Guru Pramasambhava never contradicted teaching of the Buddha. He taught Buddha's teaching.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.700
 That's what he taught. That's what that teaching brought to debate by Guru Pramasambhava, a great

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.000
 master Shandarakita.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And we have that teaching now. Everybody that follows there, no matter what.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So we all follow in light of the Buddha. And that great teacher is right here. Ready?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.220
 Today, in front, in the presence of this great teacher, right in front of his wisdom eye and

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.000
 compassion,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 we are renewing, restraining, our connection to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 As you received the rafudu vowels from great, your master's teachers, whoever that is.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Today, we are actively restraining. That is what we are doing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And it's together with the rafudu. And rafudu is, as I said earlier, you all know that.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 There is no Buddhism without rafudu. There is no Buddha teaching without Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 All teachings are completely based upon Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.270
 Reality, entire teaching is teaching of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, when you read the books of

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.000
 the Buddha.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 What else there? Really? It's all that.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Today, that, therefore, great master Atihya said, without rafudu, there is no Dharma.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.940
 There is no vowels. Every vowels, that means, patimukha vowels of the Vinaya vowels is best on the

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.000
 rafudu vowels.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And bodhijata vowels or bodhisattva vowels is best on them. That means bodhisattva is teaching.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 My inner teaching is best on rafudus. And vediyana teaching is also best on the bodhisattva rafudu.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Rafudu is really a foundation. Today, we are activating that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 So, that is the course. And this is so special and powerful.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.250
 And, particularly, this is a story of time, so special. That, according, and this is, the merit

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.000
 story of this is also,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 multiple eyes, according to the teaching, is a hundred thousand times.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Today, we put that intention forth. Really, it becomes multiple eyes.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.550
 That means, merit, when it is multiple eyes, that also, on the behind, what, on the side, or behind

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.000
 the scene.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Our observations, multiple observations of the Vinaya lifetime, are really clear up.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Clear up, and lighten up, that shedding way.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.700
 So, we are activating our beautiful, glorious, innate nature, according to Zokki, what Mahayana

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.000
 teaches.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Really, in order to get realization of the Zokki teaching,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 all Mahamudra teachings always accommodate the merits.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And merit is so important.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Akumalaki merit, Western merit, and so, this is what we really put.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And then, next one is bodhicata. And bodhicata is the enlightenment.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.780
 It is external, we say, "Oh, we're going to get the development of the bodhicata and get Buddhahood

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.000
."

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.710
 But, actually, when we do the practice of bodhicata, we're touching our goal of our own true nature

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.000
.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 That is really bodhicata. Our own true nature of the mind is enlightenment.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 According to Mahayana, according to everything, even in the Theravada teaching,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 when you get the Arhatthuud, who will get the Arhatthuud?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 There's no other who will get the Arhatthuud, except our own mind.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Our own, we cleanse and purify the naked video, or the ego cleanse and attain the Arhatthuud.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 And in Mahayana teaching, we cleanse all the obstacles, we get enlightenment.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 And in Vedic teaching, we purify all the obstacles and have a debate and get enlightenment.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 That enlightenment, where is that? It's our Buddha-nature, our nature. It's our bodhicata.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Bodhicata, that is, we're really touching. Therefore, for that reason, what Grand Master Padramu

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 said,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 that one thing, if you have one thing, is enough to reach enlightenment, that is bodhicata.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And that is. And then in Grand Master Padramu, this Maitri said, Maitri, the future Buddha said,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 "On here, there's so many benefits of the bodhicata, but please summarize that."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.520
 It will stop the lower ring, birth to lower ring, and negativity is open the door to the

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.000
 enlightenment.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And then it finally leads us to the totally beyond that and old.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 What is that? That is bodhicata. So I pay homage. That is, we're there here.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 This is right here. Here. Here. This is the Great Master. This is here.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 In this page, with Putin, he said, "Reversing the karma of the lower rings,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 showing the path to the higher rings, and finally leading to the state of the preformed old,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 and in death, I pay homage to the bodhicata." That is the power of the bodhicata.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 "Reached to the enlightenment, totally beyond death and birth, and getting old."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.240
 That is really the bodhicata. And when you have the bodhicata, all the sentient beings are our

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.000
 friend.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Everyone has become friends. We will be as the victorious son and daughters.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 From that on, we are path to the victorious.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 We will defeat our obstacles, opponents of the ego-cling, negativeities.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 That is really the bodhicata. And therefore, this bodhicata is so powerful, so special.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And bodhicata, of course you all know, this relative bodhicata, absolute true bodhicata,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 absolute true bodhicata is zokin, direct zokin, or Mahamudra, or Pandya Paramata, teach.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 That is. So this is the union of the relative bodhicata and absolute true bodhicata.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 That is where we bring, it will bring and it will lead us to be win-win, win-win.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 So it's so special. And today, again, we are actively restraining that, that we call it,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 we are annoying with that call and meaning for all of that.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 And again, we will be renewing that with the presence of the Buddha Shakyamuni, Gurupama, Sambha,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 and all the Buddha's bodhisattvas, that means at bodhisattvas, particularly.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 There are so many bodhisattvas, bodhisattva, similar stages of the Lamanjishiri,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 and Avalokiteshara, and Mahathira, Vaidya Pali.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Those are so many in the Buddha teachings, so many bodhisattvas.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 But among the at bodhisattvas, those all the at bodhisattvas are also here.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And all I have to say, everyone is right there, right in front of us, we should feel,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 and then we are going to renew, react with this sense of bodhisattva.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 So with those four, with full of joy, full of devotions, full of relief between this kind of,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 this is one of the beautiful moment in our lives.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Truly, it is. Really, I'm not just making up that.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And because it is, we are doing this.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 We are doing this because I wasn't talking to our God about how much.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.390
 Not we are not saying that, oh, I'm the great, this is the God, wrong, this is the bad, I'm the

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.000
 Spirit.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 We are not talking, we are simply talking to our heart.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 How important, how precious of this love and the compassion and kindness

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 that I'm going to make that something better for us, to benefit to myself,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 to all the beings from now on, under our rich enlightenment,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 and all the living beings' rich enlightenment.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 But that is our goal, long-lasting goal to help with that and benefit.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 It's just so special and a teaching mechanism, all the great master's mechanism.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 And we are following that path.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 It is, again, one of the highest and well-established path of enlightenment,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 path of peace and harmony, path of respect and appreciation to every living being.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 So again, it's so special.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And again, thank for all of you providing spirit and reactivity, renewing this so beautiful.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 So I just told you really kind of to remind that, again, even though we all know these things,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 I just told you to remind each other.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And now we will do this ceremony together, okay?
