00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 We didn't report that at this time, but it really is a nice conjunction, probably to the White Tara

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.260
 Empowerment and Ceremony, and we're connected to this teaching. It's wonderful. Thank you. Thank

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.000
 you everyone. Thank you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.180
 And so now, let us say, I think, that we have now enjoyed. Oh, I think so. Okay, maybe you want to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:37.260
 do. Maybe indicate it. Okay, you all know. Whatever. Whatever you know, if you don't know, just

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 follow.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Let's go!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Maybe we just do the right in front of the temple, one more time.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 We want to always see the Santa Claus come back, once in a year, every day. Thank you, thank you.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:58.210
 This is a very famous mantra also, it is the exploration of all those great dakas, dakine in the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:08.740
 teaching set. It says, when you say that and stay in the space of the dakshin, it brings the blend,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.000
 the splendor, call it the energies.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Energies. Energies in the teaching set. So it's very special. Thank you.
