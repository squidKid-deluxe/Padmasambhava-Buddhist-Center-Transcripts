00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Happy New Year is in this world. There are so many beautiful cultures, traditions, and each has a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.000
 lot of meanings, a lot of supporters of the government, all individuals of this, one of them is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 wonderful, beautiful, rich, the New Year, but it's not just the only rich, it's the accorded

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 Buddhism.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.710
 This is the place our teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, proclaims the miracle's activities at the Sarva

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 Star or Jyatavan Road where Buddha gives the Diamond Sattara's teachings.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 To repeat this, that the Jains, like today, echo the very calendars and goes on until full moon, so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.240
 therefore it's considering also Madak's multiplying months and also it is that any virtuous

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.300
 activities every do, it has a lot of powers, a lot of benefits, is really multiplied a hundred

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.560
 thousand times in teaching those teachings.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.320
 So therefore, if we all can do the activated, our bodhicata, courage and commitment, joy and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 appreciation with that thought, and then really wishing good things this world, the practice and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 meditation, and wearing good things, there's no more wars, no more famine, no more natural disaster

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.560
.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.480
 Everybody should believe happy, joy and respect to each other, so this world will become peaceful,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.560
 alone, very kind and nice, really, should be like that, but that is a very important balance.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.110
 We're talking environments, but externalities are so important, but also inner environment can come

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.890
, peace, love, convey your thought, it will really bring perfect environment of the inner level

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.560
 beings.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.780
 So our environment is perfect, inner environment is perfect, and that must be like a golden egg or

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.170
 a pill, and as a Buddha, amtava or devati, so this is really very special, so on this equation I'd

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.910
 like to again take this opportunity, wish you all best, good health, joy, peace, love, respect, and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.560
 also gratitude for ourself,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.750
 while we all have abundance and kindness, compassion, activities, according to our cover blades, to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.640
 help and to support for everyone, at least the motivation and intention will be strong and keep

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.560
 that aspiration.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.560
 And those all know an essence and foundation of the very dharma, the creative teacher for the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560
 teachings, those are really, it's dharma, so this is essence.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:03:02.620
 And thank again, wish you all such a daily, best meeting, and good health, everything, again, with

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.830
 this intention forward, and we now will begin to practice again, to support the body, all of the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.560
 Buddhas, the bodhisattvas, and dharma, sangha, over the dharma, sangha.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:15.400
 Murugam, the sambhava, and the bodhisattva, the dharas, and everyone, all of the Buddhas, the bod

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.870
hisattvas, and the lineage master support to propel our wish and our attention to what we really

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 wish for.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 Thank you again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.820
 Thank you. Now we'll begin, we do a few minutes of science and meditation, and then we'll begin

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.560
 with opening our prayer.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 Please, leading prayers as we do. Always, I thank you. Thank you.
