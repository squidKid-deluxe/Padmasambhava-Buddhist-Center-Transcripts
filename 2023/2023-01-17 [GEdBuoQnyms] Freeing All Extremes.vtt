00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 All poems are collected many atoms, in Buddhism atoms, or maybe in our US numbers called particles.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.600
 All sub-particles, all are collected of the sub-particles, collected in the heap of the sub-part

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.000
icles of the poems.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 And each particle, according to Buddha's teaching, again, is not solid.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Each particle also formed with so many sub-particles, sub-particles.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 And each of those sub-particles is like a display, or is like rain, or is like rain.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 It's nothing, really solid entities at all.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.310
 So then, therefore, that sub-particle is not solid entity, entity is like openness, or it is like

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.000
 empty.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Then, with that sub-particle formed this big, big, from what we can see, then it's the same.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.240
 It's open, it's empty, because that sub-particle, sub-sub-particle is the fundamental cause to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 bring this whole gross poems.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.510
 Even those looks gross and big, big things, but it is the same level, same nature, it's nothing

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.000
 changed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.790
 The way it started from the bottom, bottom, bottom, and the way it stopped, stopped, it's nothing

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.000
 really changed.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It's all sub-particles, the heap of sub-particles, heap of sub-particles.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Therefore, an analogy, you see, is all empty. It's emptiness, emptiness.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 There is nothing solid. And at the zukti level, zukti teaching is all display of the mind.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 It's all display of the mind, not just at the zukti level, from again, from the Mahayana teaching.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Teaching, mind-only school, all the way, is all display of the mind.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 So since it's a display of the mind, what is the mind in the zukti teaching?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Look to the mind. Is mind solid?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 That is then in the zukti teaching, again pointing out teachers.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Where is the mind? Those are all analytic way, we examine.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Where come from? Where it is? Where? Where?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 For example, now we believe when we think we have mind. It's true, we have mind.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 But this now mind, where it come from?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And now this now mind is where it's going to go, future.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And then now mind, where is this now mind?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And then mind is empty. That's what's called mind is empty.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 So since all is a display of the mind, then it is also an emptiness display.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Oh! And for example that, I said so many times, and many great masters used to, I heard.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It says like dream. In the dream we have a poem, song, it's everything.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 It's a display of the mind. There's no substantial solid entity existing.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Therefore it's called emptiness.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Since it's an emptiness of all these poems, therefore, in the teaching, it's true.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Then those great masters who are complicated of that realization, they can go through the walls.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 They can sit on the skies. They can walk on the water.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 They can expect one small things in a hundred things in there.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Over a hundred things become one.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And one instant become one eon, and one eon become one instant.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 All that, that openness of the freedom, that's called because of nature is freedom.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Nature is openness. Nature is empty of this, this nature.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.940
 That is what really in a zodiac. So this is what the point is of course, as I said at the beginning

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.000
,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.550
 where the great teacher, gracious teacher, Buddha point out skillful means leading in the Mahayana

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.000
 teaching

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 from the out to the in, but zogyteji from in to the out. Out of that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 So there is form is empty. So that means, so then what is the point here?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 We should not grasp it. We should not cling in that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 All is display of the emptiness, emptiness.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 We should not grasp it and cling. Cling is emptiness.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 That's it. Then, because when you say form is emptiness, or when the Grand Master says here,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 form is emptiness, what is also avoiding?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Avoiding, avoiding the extremes of the existence.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Avoiding and freeing the extremes existing.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 There is nothing that is extreme, existing like permanent or eternal.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Nothing. Form is the most tangible things in our world that we see.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 This is we see. Home is a tangible. Home, even home, is not as we see.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It is display. And therefore, what is releasing our extreme will of the solid existence.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Bring to the middle. It brings us to the middle of it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 This whole is removing. Removing that attitude.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Then, next one here is the word in the teaching system.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Empliness is form. Not that empty.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Now, when the Buddha gives the teaching, form is emptiness.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Then we can immediately start thinking, all is completely negation,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 or completely blank, black hole, or nothingness is.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 To avoiding that will, avoiding that attitude and idea.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And then Buddha gives the teaching immediately, right after that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Emptiness is form. Emptiness is form.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 What that avoids us, that again extreme will of nothingness,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 extreme attitude or understanding of the negation is avoided.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 That is not nature.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It's views on the extreme or prominent existing is not nature,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 and views is nothing, not existing or completely negation is not nature.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 We avoiding that, we have that tendency.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Avoid, avoid the burden of grasping. We hold that.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Then we become extreme, one way or the other. All that means.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 So Buddha is uprooting that very notion of the troublemakers,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 notion of the troublemaker to bring us to the middle,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 middle of it, or the Mademaka. Mademaka. Mademaka. Mademaka.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And also this immediately, these two words tell us this emptiness

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 and forms are not separated.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 It shows indirectly union of the emptiness and form,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 or form and emptiness are in union. They are not separated.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 They are bothered by one single status.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Immediately that's caused. So to now revolve it, drift meaning,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 drift call it of the, of the, where the nature is.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Where the nature is.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And then we kind of apply to the zoki level.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I mean it's the same, there's nothing really different.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 And then, mind is emptiness, emptiness is the mind.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Mind, all rupa is displayed and display is rupa.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Rupa is nothing different.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Nature is the same from top to bottom.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 All the nature, what the Buddha give the teaching,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 the basic Buddhist school teachings, to the highest teaching of the zoki,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 all teaching is leading to the same nature, according to their readiness.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 There's not a difference, difference. Nature is the same.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 So in the Pandya Paravana teaching and the zoki teaching,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 comes here same, same point, same states, same places, same places.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And so that is really my talk for today and I stop here.
