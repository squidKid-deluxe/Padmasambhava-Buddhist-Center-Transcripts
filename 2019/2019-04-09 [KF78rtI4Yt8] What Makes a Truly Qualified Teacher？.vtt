00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
 "Honeybee conductor is that, we all know, honeybee goes everywhere where you can get honeys or

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.560
 nurses.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:24.760
 They go joyfully, really making joyful effort and continuously and going to get the honeys, that.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:35.400
 And what that example is said, and that means looking, contracting with qualified teachers.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.520
 Qualified teacher is like, also a honeybee, they don't go to where they don't have the honeys.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.240
 Or they don't offer the honeys exactly for the sweetness. Go exactly where the honeys.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.840
 And time is precious. Situation is precious. Everything is precious. Our life is precious.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.280
 And therefore, man is meaningful precious. So, we can qualify the teacher.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.600
 Qualified teacher is in the teaching always said, "spiritual friend".

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.840
 And spiritual friend is, gathered there is two friends, according to Dharmati.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 "Spiritual friend" and "positive friend". Positive friend is "soup friend".

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.520
 Or another word, maybe "spiritive friend" can use "dharma friend".

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 Qualified teacher is, you will find, that is a perfect spiritual dharma friend.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 And then "positive friend" is our regular friend.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.440
 Therefore, that's also, even though they may be not practicing that, but yet, their attitude,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.520
 activity, conduct, all are quite good, really.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:58.280
 This is the kind of women, nice behaviors, good qualities. So, those are known as qualified.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.130
 Then, qualified teacher, of course, you can read in words of my perfect teaching and other

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 teachings.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.300
 There are so many class legends, but however, in the teaching said, qualified teacher, according to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 the Vedic Buddhism.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.280
 Because the Vedic Buddhism has all the teachings, all the teachings of the Buddhas.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.710
 And basically, Buddhism, Buddha's teaching, Mayan, Sukhar Mayan's teaching, Vedic and Mayan's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.240
 teaching, all that in the Vedic Buddhism.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.640
 So, they also practiced that, according to those qualified teachers practiced that.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.570
 So, then in the qualified teacher, what I said, in the qualified teacher, if you look back, in the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.760
 Vinaya level, also find good qualifications.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.940
 All the Vinaya teaching, all the basic Buddhist school teaching, it has quite also good

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.240
 qualifications, all the good qualities that the Mayan also found there.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.920
 And in the Mahayana practice, again, the Mahayana of the Kriya Masters has many, but basically,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 most simplified is compassion for both teachers.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.360
 Really, have the body, have strong in heart and mind, mind and practice.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.480
 And the Mahayana qualified teacher, again, there are many distractions and all that, but as you

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.050
 simplify that, one who practices meditating, meditating, what they taught, also they are practicing

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.360
 that.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800
 Not just the only speaker, but also they are practicing that.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.790
 And maintaining samayas and receiving them have the linear teachings, and also they have some

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.800
 courage and commitment to share those teachings with Behan, to the others, and also every support,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.400
 very supportive to every occasion, when you need something like that, but even they can help.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.440
 Those are known as, more the time, known as quite qualified teachers.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.870
 In the teachings, the absolute, perfect, qualified teacher is difficult to find in the daily

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.120
 interaction times, that always.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.270
 But even we have those, something with that 80%, 70%, then we can consider those are quite good,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.120
 qualified teachers.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:17.790
 To find a qualified teacher, and then the teaching said, you should also, I mean, some teaching

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.840
 said, listen what you heard from others about that teaching, that where you like to contact.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.760
 And what you see, the current look of that individual, every old style. And somehow you didn't hear

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.040
, you didn't see anything, even some suggested, do the most, do the nations.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.310
 Do the nations. Because qualified teaching, according to the Buddha teaching, this is not just the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.720
 only token, it's so important.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:55.010
 This is like really well assured us to the part. This is not just a short time, but this is a long-

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.920
term goal of our time.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.920
 If we get in light with this lifetime, then maybe we can say short time. But suppose if we didn't

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.990
 get in light with this lifetime, we are planning, we are laying the foundation for a long time to

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.600
 discover our old generation.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.080
 And this is the first of our steps, or at least in this lifetime we make these steps. So therefore,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040
 qualified teacher is so, so important.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.960
 And so, kind of examine carefully, and go call with me. Once you find the qualified teacher, what

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.240
 he said, then be expert.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.300
 And what any teacher says, the words of my part of the teacher, what he said, be expert to examine

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.130
 the teacher, be expert to contract with the teacher, be expert to learn from the qualified teachers

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.480
.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 Post, second, and third, always be expert to find the qualified teacher, be smart, be expert. And

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.760
 once you form, to learn, learn that, or to be expert with contract, communication, make

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.560
 relationship in a small world, be expert.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.480
 I mean, he launched the role of the great master of Malaria, once he formed, and of course Malaria

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.480
 is the highest couple of individuals.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:30.400
 How is courage and commitment persisted? The zillow, what's called the zillow? Resilience? Yeah,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.600
 the zillows.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.600
 And just really, so correct, and read Umchimpa's words. Umchimpa is also, I mean, he is teaching,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.900
 even your highest, highly qualified, or highly educated individuals, without the teacher, you're

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.600
 not going to get enlightenment.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:57.370
 Even you know all the Buddha teachings, teaching and memorizing all those teachings, won't get

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:04.600
 enlightenment without the other five teachers, when you're not conquered.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:14.090
 That we can see in Tibet, that Umchimpa is highly educated. All the knowledge that exists in the

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:23.180
 Buddhism, or the great Buddha, there are always ten knowledges, or ten signs of the mind, or ten

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.600
 knowledges, well, not signs of the mind.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.570
 Umchimpa is an expert, but to read the enlightenment, to be discovered, he is old in the nature of

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.600
 the truth.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.210
 He went to a contract with the Zinkummarada, with the Dharakummaradas. When he went there, he didn

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.600
't go with arrogance, or "I'm learned, I'm scholars."

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.440
 And what they know is that, so humble, so humane, and so we're devoted to the development. In India

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.600
, and for example, great master for Naravas.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:03.240
 According to his story, Naravas is so educated, one of the highest, top great bandedas for the

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.600
 scholars in that context.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.750
 But to discover the absolute true nature, he contract, searched in a contract that, diligently with

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.600
 his master, the Lord.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.600
 And what they, what, if you did that, what they forgot, all become enlightened.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 Okay, the Lord, Narava, become great master of Naravas.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:34.760
 Umchimpa become great Buddha, or the old, many times, the second garab dol, or the garab dol you

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.600
 would debate.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 Umchimpa become.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:45.760
 This is what, they say, is so correct, commitment, persistently, and continually, then, learning,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.600
 observing, and nourishing ourself.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.520
 Naravas. And when you're learning what is in the Buddha teaching that you all know, studying,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.600
 contemplating, and then, that is what prepare you the meditation.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 Studying, contemplating, teaching, not just, "Oh, that's enough, that's enough."

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:21.220
 Enough. Teaching is enough, enough. Teaching is always good, you see. But enough is the emotional

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.600
 activities, enough.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.520
 That is really enough, if you can make that enough, still. All these emotions, endless ego-cling

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.600
 activities, self-emotional activities.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.520
 And we can stop that, and we can say that, and we have the courage to say, "Well, that's enough,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.600
 that's enough."

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.600
 You're making, or we're making some cornerstone statement of the practitioners.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 Teaching is always said. And what did the teaching say?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.650
 The great math, masters of practitioners in Bodhisattva did learn so many things. Never say, "

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.600
Enough" as the ocean.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 Ocean is in all the waters of the world, but never say, "It's enough."

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 That's to use the examples. That is. And then, contemplating, not just the receiving, receiving,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 but putting our own intelligence,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:20.090
 our own shop intellectual, say, just making some sense, as teaching said, and our knowledge make

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.600
 that more meaningful, tangible, so that we can practice.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.830
 So that we can practice it. When we meditate, we practice it, we don't have any doubt, hesitation,

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.600
 this and that, then we're settled.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:41.600
 So that is what's known as searching, honey bee-like conduct.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:49.750
 Now, when you have the opportunity to qualify a teacher and then receive the teaching, contemplate

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.600
 on that, now we're going to meditate.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:03.180
 Meditating is then used, for example, as swallowing. A bird swallows, swallows, swallows, then

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.600
 enters that.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.700
 Then we don't have the horrid sense. According to the teaching, that bird swallows, that really

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.600
 enters that bird in the nest.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 Don't make any hesitations. Just immediately goes in. That's it.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 And comfortable stay in the cozy nestle, cozy nestle. That's it. Relax now. Why are you worried?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 And you say, relax. That is the result of the meditating. Now meditating, relax.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.890
 Calm and beautiful, reveal all the tools that you learned, receive the teaching and you learn and

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.600
 you got.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.600
 Now apply that. You apply your studying to meditate, meaningful.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 You apply that, your contraption to meditate, meaningful.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 Become a result. That is meditation. That is practice.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 That is swallow, like conductors, conductors.
