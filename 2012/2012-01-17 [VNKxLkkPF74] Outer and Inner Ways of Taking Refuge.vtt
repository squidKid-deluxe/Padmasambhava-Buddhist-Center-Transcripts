00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 "The essence, the ultimate meaning of Raphukhi is your love, devotion, joy, confidence, and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 atrocity to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. That is the religion that is started from the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.680
 heart. Now in the Vedayana teaching, and this is not just the Vedayana making up these things,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.440
 but this is where things are. And we begin to explore the richness of the nature's meaning,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.720
 nature's richness. Then there is many different kind of like there that we advance deepening

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.880
 or moving forward. In that context, then in the Vedayana teaching,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:58.320
 I can say, the object of refuge as outer object of refuge, inner object of refuge, and cigarette

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 object of refuge, and a very ultimate object of refuge. So there is about four different

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.640
 levels that we can embarrassing of this meaning of refuge. Exchana refuge, taking refuge, is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 the way to involve more kind of more dealing with world, with things are in the world, where

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 we can perceive that. And that is then always we call Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. So the Buddha

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.880
 is one, and Dharma is second, and the Sangha is third. So then Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.160
 The inner technique of refuge, inner understanding of the refuge is then known as in the Vedayana

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:07.280
 teaching, Guru, Deva, and Dakinis. And Guru as Buddha, deity or the Yadam as Dharma, and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 Dakini as Sangha, which have refuge. Generally, again, what means Guru as Buddha? And Guru,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.280
 for example, generally, Gurba and Masambha, but also Guru means one way, the teacher.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 Teacher which represents generally the Buddha, representing that. Whether they are qualified

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.720
 or not, when you say the teacher, then is represented Buddha. Therefore, always in the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.520
 Vedayana teaching, and not just the Vedayana teaching, always a qualified teacher. That

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.640
 is which is really important, qualified teacher. After this qualified teacher, truly that teacher

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.820
 representing Buddha. So therefore, Guru as Buddha. And then, generally, always in the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.680
 Newma school subject, where Buddhism often said, no matter whatever Guru you have, or

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 the teacher you have, you can always see they are like as part of the Gurba and Masambha.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.080
 So we are utilizing through the closeness to the Gurba and Masambha. So under the Gurba

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 Gurba and Masambha, all the teachers there, and feel the Gurba and Masambha represent

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.680
 all the teachers. That's what always in the teaching said. And not just in the Newma school,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 but always in the, in generally in the Tibetan Buddhism said, in the, the Gurba and Masambha

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.520
 is the teacher of the Tibetans, teacher of all the Tibetan Buddhists. That's what how

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.360
 Gurba and Masambha came. And among all the deities, the Awalakti Shora is the deity of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.760
 the all the Tibetan practitioners, Tibetan Buddhists, always. This is how Karmagli connected.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:12.720
 And among all the nakinis, the Tara is then again, Karmagli connected to deities or nakinis

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.080
 to the Tibetan practitioners that they often say that. So in that case, now, Gurba and

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:26.760
 Masambha, which is the embodiment of all Buddhas. When we take rafu, rafu to the Buddha Dharma

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.280
 Sangha externally is the Buddha Shaktamuni and all the dharmas. And then, then the Sanghas,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.840
 all different levels of Sanghas inwardly, then is Buddha Shaktamuni is no other than

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 Gurba and Masambha. So, Rafu in Gurba and Masambha, Gurba and Masambha. Then what the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.440
 next one is the yadams. So that is about the Guru and then about the yadam. Yadam is represented

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:08.240
 in the Dharma. That means what is really Dharma? Dharma is this, of course, Sanskrit word, but

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:17.440
 which means, if we translate that Dharma into English, it has meaning, meaning, correcting,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.920
 and protecting. Correcting and protecting. It's called Chhichyuki yondi nidhe dema in

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.360
 the Tibetan. Yamodhana, that's the great master Vasubendu, who is one of the leading masters

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.160
 in Sri Mahayana Buddhism or in Buddhism, and who wrote the famous text as Abhidharma, Abhidharma

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.240
 teachings, or the conventional meaning of Abhidharma, Amidharma kosha, kosha, that's the quote.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:56.440
 And he said one of his teachings, what means the meaning of the Dharma? He is a nimudhana

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.960
 mala chhiba, nimudhana mala chhiba, nimudhana mala chhiba, because it is protecting, correcting

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:15.760
 us, correcting us from all the habit patterns of the emotions. And by that, it will protect

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:25.160
 us from any wrong, wrong directions, wrong directions. Therefore, this is known as Dharma

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:35.840
 teaching, teaching of the Dharma. So that means it has meaning of the correcting and protecting,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:45.800
 correcting from the habit pattern and negative emotions. By that, it is protecting to the

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.640
 wrong directions of all the wrong realms and all the wrong directions, and always putting

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.880
 up in the correct right directions of that is free from the habit patterns and free from

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:09.520
 the negative emotions. That is the meaning of the Dharma. So Dharma, therefore, yidam

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:18.800
 is what? Yidam, the intubated word means something that is heartly connected, heartly connected.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:28.640
 That means absolutely yidam is no other than our love, kindness, and compassion, and wisdom.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.640
 That is the really yidam. In this case, for example, yidam. The ultimate yidam is no other

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.840
 than compassion. When you have the tremendous power of compassion, what it will do? What

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:51.840
 it will protect? It will protect us from immediately from raging angers, raging self-importance.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.760
 Because of that, it will eliminate all the kind of publications of that, the publications

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:06.460
 that are produced by these negativities of the anger, and then yellows, and so forth.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:13.040
 It will make our heart more soft, tender, tender, and that is what the really the compassion

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:21.960
 is. That is yidam. This is yidam. Yidam is ultimately speaking, yidam is no other than

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:29.680
 our practice, our teaching, our Dharma, something that connected to our heart. That is the meaning

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:40.840
 of the yidam. Then the rakinis, the inner object of rafuji as a sangha, rakinis, of course

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.720
 externally rakinis, are often said such as the original dakini, shinshoja, and the madatara.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:59.240
 All the females, females like enlightened beings, are identified as rakinis or dakinis.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.420
 But what means also generally is sanghas. Sanghas, as I said, extended sangha also means

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:13.160
 source of inspirations. Sangha is known as the source of inspiration, source of the one

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:23.200
 who helps and supports the growth of our enlightenment. And the dakinis are the display of loving

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:31.640
 kindness and compassion. Compassion, they always support us into the part, into the

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:40.520
 enlightened part. Therefore, dakinis are as known as then the sanghas. And also, there

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.520
 are many different categories of the dakinis in the teaching set. Of course, there are

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:54.520
 both Buddhas and two of them. But the dakinis can be as enlightened as the Vaidyavara, Yishinshoja,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.800
 and the Thara. But from their emanations, also emanated, there are so many kind of like

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.240
 utterly connected enlightened dakinis. So they support and help in assuring to the us

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.680
 in the part, in the teaching set. So therefore, dakinis are known as representing in that

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:21.280
 way sangha members. Even though each of these guru, yadam, and then dakini represent all

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.240
 those in the body of three of your rafugis, but when you highlight with each qualities,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:38.020
 qualities, then they are in that way understanding. The guru as Buddha, yadam as Dharma, and dak

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.560
inis

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.880
 are as Sangha members. With this understanding, then we tell rafugis. That means again, rafugis

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.840
 meaning of ultimate meaning of rafugis is making close connection. You in the devotee

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 love to feel closeness. That is the what the meaning of rafugis.
