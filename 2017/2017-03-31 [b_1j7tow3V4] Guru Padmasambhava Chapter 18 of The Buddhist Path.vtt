NOTE     "synopsis": "Main Topics Being Discussed \n \n1. \"It is very important for people who wish to follow the Vajrayana teachings to have a connection with Guru Padmasambhava, the first main teacher of the tantric tradition in Tibet. Buddha Shakyamuni promised to be reborn in the form of Guru Padmasambhava in order to spread the Vajrayana teachings in this world. The Buddha predicted Padmasambhava's activities nineteen times in the sutras and tantras. Just as predicted, Guru Padmasambhava was miraculously born in the middle of a lotus in northwest India, in the country of Oddiyana, eight years after Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, about 500 BCE. ... In the middle of the eighth century, Guru Padmasambhava came to Tibet at the invitation of King Trisong Deutsen, the most powerful leader in Asia at that time. Trisong Deutsen was dedicated to establishing the Dharma in Tibet and called upon Padmasambhava for help. Guru Padmasambhava subdued all the negative forces and blessed the entire land of Tibet. He consecrated the land and supervised the building of Samye Monastery, the first Tibetan monastery. By giving the Vajrayana teachings in accordance with the individual needs and abilities of his students, many Tibetans attained enlightenment through his teachings and transmissions. Among his most famous students were the twenty-five close disciples, nine of whom were called his heart students, and the eighty great siddhas.\" (pg 87, 1st paragraph and pg 89 2nd full paragraph)\n\n2. \"On the day of his departure from Tibet, Padmasambhava's students and the current king and courtiers went with him to a mountain pass named Gungthang Lathog on the border of Tibet and Nepal. He stopped at the mountain pass and said that no one should follow him further. All the people became very emotional, and as he began giving his final teaching he levitated and continued teaching from the sky. A horse appeared in the air and he mounted the horse and rode off in the western direction. Guru Padmasambhava did not die in the way that we normally think of death, rather he was able to transmute all the gross elements of his body into wisdom light. This is called attaining the rainbow body, and it is a state of wisdom beyond birth and death. ... Guru Padmasambhava holds a special place among the Tibetan Buddhist schools, most of which trace transmissions and blessings directly from him. He is an embodiment of all enlightened beings. Of course, all the buddhas work for the benefit of sentient beings, but because Guru Padmasambhava made the Vajrayana teachings available to us, he is considered to be the special buddha of our era.\" (pg 90 2nd full paragraph, and pg 91 last paragraph)\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nSutrayana [Skt.; Tib. mdo'i theg pa]. The general distinction between the visions of the Sutrayana and Vajrayana is related with their \"causal\" and \"resultant\" views. The Sutrayana is often referred to as the \"Causal Yana.\" In these teachings one gathers good foundations and causes, and results gradually begin to sprout based on the accumulation of these causes. In contrast, the Vajrayana is known as the \"Resultant Yana,\" or \"Effect Yana,\" where one instantly approaches the five enlightened qualities of one's buddha-nature without gradually gathering the causes and conditions. The Vajrayana immediately jumps to that state, instantly discovering the resultant vision of pure body, speech, and mind. The Sutrayana includes (1) the Shravakayana, (2) the Pratyekabuddhayana, and (3) the Bodhisattvayana. In contrast, the Vajrayana includes the three Outer Tantras of (4)Kriyayoga,(5) Upayoga, and (6) Yogayoga, as well as the three Inner Tantras of (7) Mahayoga, (8) Anuyoga, and (9) Atiyoga. (Liberating Duality with Wisdom Display, pg 176-7)\n\ntantra [Skt.; Tib. rgyud]. The inseparable, indivisible union of wisdom and enlightened body, or enlightened formations. In other words, the original quality of emptiness and wisdom display. The Sanskrit word tantra literally means \"continuity\" or \"continuum.\" As the Venerable Rinpoches explain in SPG, \"[W]hat is continuing? In the context of the Guhyagarbha Tantra, the profound and beautiful qualities of the inherent richness nature of each and every being are continuing. This nature continues without any interruption whatsoever, regardless of the external changes we go through related with circumstances and situations. External changes never affect the continuity of the reality nature we all share.\" (Liberating Duality with Wisdom Display, pg 177)\n\nPBC YouTube Videos of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches for Further Study \n \nGuru Padmasambhava Embodies All the Buddhas \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuOBOuPf30\n\nOn July 17, 2011 at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche bestowed a Guru Padmasambhava empowerment according to the terma lineage of the great terton Tsasum Lingpa. Here Khenpo Rinpoche teaches on the history and special meaning of Guru Padmasambhava.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hello, welcome to the PBC Morning Dawn study group at Padmasamy Ling, the Venerable

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.000
 Camperimache's retreat center in Monastery in New York. Today we're discussing

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 Chapter 18 of their book, "The Buddhist Path," and the chapter is called "Guru Padmasambhava."

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.720
 So we'll begin by doing our usual opening prayers, and then we'll begin the discussion.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 Thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 [Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 Vajrasapha, Pramadabhadra, Sri Singham, Tamakara, the 25 king and subjects,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.880
 souls who are known, young, and the hundred chardons and others,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 the lamas of the Kama and Tramala ninjas to you I pray,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.400
 the supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.360
 which is the essential, extraordinary view and doctrine of the early translation school,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.240
 you keep alive and spread by the light of wisdom, Lord of Dharma, great kenpo,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.800
 I pray at your lotus feet, in the palace of the old man Dharmadhaktu,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.960
 the one who shows clearly the Dharmakaya of my own mind,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.080
 we pray to the honor of old Rudguru, glorious true teacher, precious one,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.960
 dwelling on the lotus seed and the crown of my head, hold me with your great kindness,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:59.440
 and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:31.680
 So chapter 18 in the Buddhist Path begins on page 87,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 with this chapter is entitled Guru Padmasambhava.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.000
 So I'll quickly summarize the first half of the chapter, then we'll have our discussion.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.880
 So the Vembrokemba Ramachas begin by saying it is very important for Vajrayana practitioners

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 to have a connection to Guru Padmasambhava, the enlightened being who was the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.580
 reincarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni, and the person who brought Tantric-Vatrayana teachings to Tibet

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.040
.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.680
 Guru Vembroke was miraculously emanated as an eight-year-old boy in the middle of a lotus

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.920
 in the country of Udayana, around 500 BCE, four western calendar years after the Buddhas

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.320
 parinirvana. He was found by King Indra Butti, who is so happy, and he asked him, Guru Vembroke,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.760
 to be his son and live in his royal palace, which Guru Vembroke did for many years.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.160
 After leaving the palace, Guru Vembroke traveled to many cemeteries to practice meditation.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.400
 Although he was already enlightened, Guru Vembroke did this to demonstrate

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.160
 that practicing meditation for the benefit of all beings leads to enlightenment.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.880
 Although Guru Vembroke took many different forms to help beings everywhere,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.360
 he had eight principal manifestations to demonstrate different important aspects of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.960
 the path to enlightenment. During his life, some different people were jealous of him and tried to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.200
 kill him by drowning or burning him, but no one was successful. Instead, Guru Vembroke used these

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 opportunities to demonstrate his realization of the infinite flexibility of experience

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.840
 and would bring many beings to the Dharma with his compassionate, miraculous activities.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:10.320
 The Indian King Ashoka was a brutal ruler who killed thousands of people. He lived about 200

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.840
 years after the Buddha's parinirvana. But by coming in contact with Guru Ramaj in the form of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.680
 Guru Sakya Senge, King Ashoka completely gave up all violence and instead began peacefully

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.160
 establishing the Buddha Dharma throughout southern Asia, including building a million stupas.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.680
 In the middle of the eighth century, Guru Ramaj was invited to Tibet to establish Buddhism there.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.640
 At this point in time, Guru Ramaj was about 1,500 years old.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:53.280
 I'll read the first topic point. This comes from page 87, the first paragraph, and then page 89,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 the second full paragraph. "It is very important for people who wish to follow the Vajrayana

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.560
 teachings to have a connection with Guru Padmasabhava, the first main teacher of the tantric

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.040
 tradition in Tibet. Buddha Shakyamuni promised to be reborn in the form of Guru Padmasambhava

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.480
 in order to spread the Vajrayana teachings in this world. The Buddha predicted Padmasambhava's

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.130
 activities 19 times in the sutras and tantras. Just as predicted, Guru Padmasambhava was mirac

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.600
ulously

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.200
 born in the middle of a lotus in northwest India in the country of Orihana, eight years after

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.450
 Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, about 500 BCE. In the middle of the eighth century, Guru Padmasambh

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.640
ava

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.640
 came to Tibet. At the invitation of King Trissang Detsen, the most powerful leader in Asia at that

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.160
 time, Trissang Detsen was dedicated to establishing the Dharma in Tibet and called upon Padmasambh

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.520
ava

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.040
 for help. Guru Padmasambhava subdued all the negative forces and blessed the entire land

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.000
 of Tibet. He consecrated the land and supervised the building of Samya monastery, the first Tibetan

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.520
 monastery. By giving the Vajrayana teachings in accordance with the individual needs and abilities

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.160
 of his students, many Tibetans obtained enlightenment through his teachings and transmissions.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.440
 Among his

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.120
 most famous students were the 25 close disciples, nine of whom were called his heart students and

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 the 80 great Siddhas. Well, I was just thinking maybe wanting to ask a little bit about Guru

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.240
 Padmasambhava as being the reincarnation of Guru Shakyamuni and kind of, you know, as the same

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.440
 being in a way, I mean the same mind stream, but they taught different things. It seems like, I

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.000
 mean, you know, Guru Padmasambhava maybe emphasizing the Vajrayana teachings.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.040
 And then how was that different than what Guru Shakyamuni was teaching and maybe why?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.600
 Anyone have any thoughts on that?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:15.120
 I was just thinking about it. If you think of the different styles of each each is different time,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.280
 you know, Guru Shakyamuni was working in a time where it didn't seem like the emphasis was like

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.720
 the yogic tradition in that sense of going off into the gate and doing that solo where it seemed

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.440
 like, you know, more communities and really focusing on that real cultivating that ethic at

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.160
 that foundation. And so there it seems the Sutra really brings out those qualities, you know,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.600
 whereas once you get into the times of Guru Padmasambhava and you're also looking at the

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.320
 flexibility of all the different ways that, you know, Guru Padmasambhava was working in all of

00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.360
 those times, it seems it ties that, you know, the Vajrayana, it seems to be more the

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.480
 tool that fits the time. It seems what both the Sutras fit the time, fit the circumstance,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.960
 it fit what is needed at the time. And then when Guru Padmasambhava was teaching, you know,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.720
 the Vajrayana, that clear, you know, and also you're thinking of the different regions.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:21.440
 To me, that just seems like you have to tie into that, but I can't be certain.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.520
 Yeah, maybe like the time and the places too. Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:35.280
 In India mainly, and then Guru Padmasambhava was in Tibet a lot of his life. And so maybe like the

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.960
 teachings that they gave were really according both to the time and the cultures and the people

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:53.360
 there and what they were, what was appropriate. It's difficult. It's hard to take the tack of like

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.400
 really looking at the cultural context without really investigating it and knowing it. I don't

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.600
 personally know it that well. I mean, Guru Mache was in India. He was born 500 BCE and then went

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.680
 into Tibet mainly in the eighth century. So he's there for like 1300 years in India, doing a lot,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.080
 you know. And it was so different, the culture and the countries.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.720
 Maybe a good way is to look at what are the differences between, or let's highlight the

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.000
 differences and similarities between the sutras and the tantras. Instead of looking at the cultural

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.640
 context side, which is really factual, detail oriented, where we really have to get all the

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.560
 facts straight. But the sutras and tantras, of course we have to get the facts straight,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.680
 but we can talk more generally in terms of the teachings, how the Buddha, like how Buddhism

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.640
 is presented in terms of the sutras and tantras, which may be a little more fruitful.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.320
 So what are principal distinctions between some sutra and tantra?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.800
 Or like, so who taught what and what are some principal distinctions?

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.480
 Well, I thought to just point out, like leaning into that, that all the

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.360
 thousand, they say a thousand Buddhas are going to appear during this fortunate Iyam, this

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.200
 Kapa that we live in right now. And that one of these Supreme and Ramada Kai emanation,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.920
 they're called manifest enlightenment, full enlightenment, as fully enlightened Buddhas.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:25.280
 They always take the form of fully ordained monk. So that's just a, and then generally,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:34.560
 like Buddha Shakyamuni, on the outer level, talked of just sutra-yana, you know, the causal yana of

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.400
 cause and effect, including the four noble truths. And that basically, you practice this way,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.160
 a brute suffering, and engage in the causes to attain enlightenment. And based on that, you

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.720
 experience the result. I mean, I just thought to just mention that particular form that the

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.720
 Buddhas manifest in. That's correct, right? They always take the form of fully ordained monk when

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.360
 they demonstrate enlightenment in this Kapa. I think of this Kapa. Definitely not of all the

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:12.560
 Buddhas. So that's like when, I mean, just to be specific about that, of those thousand Buddhas,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.480
 they come when the full, the complete instructions for achieving enlightenment at that time don't

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.840
 exist yet. Maybe part of them exist, or none of them exist. So they're those thousand Buddhas when

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.520
 they come, when at that time there isn't complete instructions to achieve enlightenment. And that's

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:37.280
 when those thousand Buddhas manifest as fully ordained monks. So that's why Guru Padmasambhava,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.440
 who was a fully enlightened being, also, but he was not an ordained monk. Because, you're saying,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:54.080
 because, at that time, at one point, Buddhist teachers were available. Because he's not one

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.280
 of the one thousand, they call it, supreme namadakalayana emanations. A specific type of

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.320
 emanation that manifests how to attain enlightenment. But when the teachings,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.080
 like Kapa said, when the teachings don't exist. But I mean, the reason why I mention that is mainly

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.760
 because on the outer level, that accords with the duality mind of beings. It's very clear.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:26.960
 And it's very clear. The conduct would be very clear. It's like, people see that and they know,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:34.160
 they kind of know what it means. And they can use that as a basis. But Guru Padmasambhava's conduct

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.160
,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.800
 for example, was, the Buddhist conduct was beyond duality too. But Guru Padmasambhava engaged in

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:40.960
 all

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.800
 kind of liberating. He was born in a lotus. Yeah, he was born in a lotus, as an eight-year-old.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:54.960
 But I mean, just that distinction, you know, to show that, you know, you can't really misunderstand

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:02.960
 Buddha Shakyamuni's, you know, when he's establishing the teachings, where he stands.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.720
 And I think, too, again, maybe this isn't as particular to sutriyana, tantriyana,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.200
 as to a distinction, but just that level of how

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:19.870
 Buddha Shakyamuni's wisdom, mind and abilities and everything's so vast, as well as Guru Padmasambh

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.400
ava.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.560
 And so we're really talking mostly right now from the perspective of our human world.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:37.840
 Like, Guru Shakyamuni taught all of these teachings. And at that time, within humanity,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.720
 who was ready, you know, to receive, it was mostly the foundational teachings, you know,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:53.600
 sutriyana teaches everything that he more widely taught, like that most humans received. But he

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.480
 taught on so many other levels and with other beings. And then, just in that aspect of Guru

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:08.240
 Pashay's activities, then, too, how he's not introducing something new that Buddha Shakyamuni

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.080
 never mentioned. It's just he, the times where conditions were kind of coming right. And already,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.560
 I mean, it wasn't just Guru Padmasambhava. There were so many great realized masters who had

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.520
 realized, you know, mahayana, tantrayana, vajayana practices, it's like the civilizations at that

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.240
 time were like these amazing Buddhist civilizations. And so there were so many great masters and

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.080
 Guru Padmasambhava was this great, blazing, wisdom being who really, you know,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:49.040
 helped to really bring down into this world, maybe all this other aspect of all the

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.280
 Buddha Shakyamuni's teachings, you know, to this, again, he taught too many too, but within our

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.160
 human

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.120
 experience, the Buddha's teachings and the

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.320
 vajrayana too, which entails mahayana, yanayana, it's the whole package.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.640
 So maybe just to think of them, like you're saying, just to summarize what you're saying,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.400
 is that they, that both Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava taught the entire path.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:26.960
 And it's just that, that maybe Guru Shakyamuni, because of the circumstances of the time,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:33.680
 was highlighting maybe more the sutrayana teachings in a really outward way.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:42.880
 And then Guru Padmasambhava, his time, his very long life, was highlighting more the tantrayana.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:51.680
 But which is based, as you said, on the sutrayana. One interesting thing too, I just thought of

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.160
 this,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.280
 we also have to recognize that, you know, we're hearing this,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.120
 you know, through, I mean, particularly with with Buddha Shakyamuni, it was others who wrote

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.080
 things down, you know, it was, it was the Arhats coming together to write those things. So,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.560
 you know, who's to say that, you know, I mean, maybe we heard the sentence, but you know how many

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.880
 different levels of Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching on, but how many levels are people hearing on,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:20.320
 you know, how many levels are they conveying on. I think also on our end too, you know, as we're,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.520
 as we're, as we're going over the teachings and, you know, studying and contemplating,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.920
 meditating on those teachings, you know, it's also, you know, it's, it's not that the time,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.680
 you know, all the different levels of the teaching are, of course, in these things and,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:50.160
 you know, how much is the harvest activity too. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's good, we could say a lot.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.080
 There's just this distinction between sutra and tantra are really, so it's good, just like, I mean,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.480
 I think to reiterate what Lai was saying, within the tantras are the sutras. So the tantras include

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:10.000
 the sutras. Bhafriyana includes Sutra Mahayana, includes Hinayana. That's very clear. So when

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.800
 Guru Rinpoche came to Tibet, or when he was in India, and demonstrating all this, all the different

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.560
 aspects of the teaching, and he was known as like the master of tantra, like he brought this tantra

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:27.540
 teachings into Tibet, meaning all of the Buddha's teachings into Tibet. It's to say that he, I mean

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:27.680
,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.080
 it's really to emphasize the point that it includes everything that Buddhist Shakyamuni taught,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.880
 while Buddhist Shakyamuni in human form lived for 81 years, around 600, so BC, includes all those

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.680
 teachings. And those teachings, like Andrew said, they're more outer level teachings. You, like,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.840
 for example, there is suffering, we see that in our experience. We don't have to have any

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.040
 philosophy,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.920
 or have any unusual belief to know that suffering exists, because we directly experiencing

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.400
 ourselves according to how our mind is right now. It suffers, there's pain, there's sickness, we

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:00.560
 see

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.080
 that. We, you don't have to convince someone. It's self-evident to all of us. And so the sutras

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.320
 really

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.760
 line up with the, like Andrew said, the duality mind, or the, just our usual habitual way of

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.560
 understanding things. There are these, there's suffering, so it has a cause. So Buddha taught the

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.520
 cause. Is there a way to end suffering? Buddha said, yes, there is a way. There's a path. You,

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.240
 by accumulating these positive causes, you eventually can achieve the cessation of suffering.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:35.360
 And so that sutra, meaning, it posits that there truly is a real suffering. There is a real cause

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.000
 there, right? There are these things we experience, there is sickness, there is me. And so the next

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.720
 step in sutra is to say, well, where is the suffering? Where is its really cause? Where is

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.680
 this real me that we experience? And so then you get the second turning teachings on the emptiness

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:58.560
 of the flexibility of these things. That samsara isn't, samsara is more of a thought or a concept

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.320
 in our minds. But then the tantrana goes beyond that and says it's not just that, you know, these

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.480
 concepts are totally flexible. But what happens, how is our mind when it's not habitually grabbing

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.600
 onto these concepts in such a narrow way? Then, then what becomes available? Then how flexible

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.200
 are things? And so tantra is, that's almost like the starting point of tantra, when the nature is

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:28.320
 totally unrestricted by its conceptual grasping. And then what is available? You have a being that

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.800
 can arise and live for 1,500 years and, you know, manifest in eight different ways as a fully

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.120
 ordained monk. There is a blue, you know, a blue being like surrounded with flames and just all

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:47.200
 these things that totally shake our usual rigid way of just assuming things only are this one way.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.760
 So tantra includes the much greater flexibility of what the mind and heart can do when it's not

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.160
 held,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.680
 holding onto itself so tightly. And then, so yeah, this, like, just to say a few principles.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:01.920
 Because

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.960
 it's similar, and so I have to really emphasize the similarity between sutra and tantra and the

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.640
 distinction between sutra and tantra. And so Rinpoche says so many times, tantra goes directly

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.680
 to the nature. Whereas sutra stays, goes, starts at the grasping we have and then peels away that

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:26.000
 grasping and slowly, gradually reveals the nature. The tantra goes directly to the nature and

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.560
 releases

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.640
 the grasping that's covering up that nature from being fully evident to everyone, to oneself and

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.520
 others. So it directs a question also of directness and it's related to a non-yana system. So it's

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.560
 more direct and more detailed and more of a complete expression of what the nature is when it's not

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.800
 covered by any grasping.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:21:01.200
 So there's a lot to say, I mean, but maybe we'll keep going and get to this second point too.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.760
 Here I'll do a quick summary of the second half of the chapter. So Rinpoche continues saying there

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.280
 are different accounts of how long Rinpoche stayed in Tibet, but most say he stayed for 100, about

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.000
 111

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.320
 lunar years, which means about 55 years in the western calendar. These different accounts of

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.880
 his life demonstrate that Rinpoche was not restricted by our usual limited concepts,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.640
 since the nature of ourselves and everything is naturally limitless. Some accounts say that he

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.760
 stayed in Tibet for about 55 years at the request of Dharma king Tritsendetsen to help the Dharma

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.000
 continue after the king passed away. On the day of Rinpoche's departure from Tibet, he gave his

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.680
 final teachings, then ascended into the sky on a horse, leaving to tame beings and bring them to

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.880
 peace of Dharma in the land of the glorious copper-colored mountain. You say so, Jahl, and all the

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.160
 great Chertans have met Rinpoche at least once at Copper-Color Mountain, to receive teachings from

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.240
 Guru Rinpoche about revealing terma treasures and benefiting the Dharma and all beings.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.000
 In his terma teachings, Guru Rinpoche gave many detailed instructions about what would happen

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.120
 in the future, sometimes centuries later, and how to help solve various problems and imbalances of

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.200
 those different times. Guru Rinpoche also composed some written teachings in the Kama oral lineage,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.320
 which were not concealed as terma for future generations, including teachings such as the

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.760
 garland of views, commentary on the Gurya Garvatantra, ornament of the cemetery cuckoo, and others.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:38.240
 Guru Rinpoche is a living Buddha who has been important to all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.520
 most of which trace their transmission and blessing directly from him. He embodies all

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.320
 the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and enlightened masters of all 10 directions and three times,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 and is the special Buddha of our era.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.920
 That's the chapter.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:08.880
 So the second topic for discussion is from page 90, second full paragraph, and page 91,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:18.480
 the last paragraph. On the day of his departure from Tibet, Padmasambhava students and current

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:25.360
 and the current king and courtiers went with him to a mountain pass named Guntang Lhotap.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.720
 On the border of Tibet and Nepal, he stopped at the mountain pass and said that no one should

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:39.360
 follow him further. All the people became very emotional, and as he began giving his final

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.160
 teaching, he levitated and continued teaching from the sky. A horse appeared in the air,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.720
 and he mounted the horse and rode off in the western direction. Guru Padmasambhava did not die

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:59.220
 in the way that we normally think of death. Rather, he was able to transmute all the gross elements

00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.360
 of

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.240
 his body into wisdom light. This is called attaining the rainbow body, and it is a state

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.960
 of wisdom beyond birth and death. Guru Padmasambhava holds a special place among the Tibetan

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.360
 Buddhist

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.760
 schools, most of which trace transmission and blessings directly from him. He is an embodiment

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.440
 of all enlightened beings. Of course, all the buddhas work for the benefit of sentient beings,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.320
 but because Guru Padmasambhava made the Vajrayana teachings available to us,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.160
 he is considered to be the special Buddha of our era.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:54.720
 It's funny, Guru Rinpoche, all these qualities, even with our beautiful teachers,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:04.240
 just kind of leaves you speechless. This chapter is very biographical,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:12.160
 but it's interesting in that way of how, like we mentioned earlier, Guru Padmasambhava was really

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:21.120
 establishing these levels of the really direct levels of the Buddhist teachings,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:28.080
 really displaying the flexibility of the nature and how this boundless, inconceivable

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:38.000
 activities of bodhicitta and everything. In every single way, not just that he sat and taught,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.680
 but like every example of his life, that's the thing that kind of calls out the way,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:54.800
 you know, from, we just look at that, like we mentioned earlier, born on a lotus, and

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:06.800
 he never died in the way that we consider. I mean, he just, you know, there's even just those

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:14.640
 two major marker points is such a deep, profound display of the nature, which is what the teachings

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:23.520
 are. I mean, that's kind of what really kind of strikes home in a way, just how the activities,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:34.080
 there's the teachings, but then there's the teaching of just all these displays of what's possible.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.040
 And then, like, Lojo, I think what you were getting at earlier, like, as far as,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.600
 it sounded like you were talking a little bit about devotion and something on that level of just

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:55.280
 how that, it's like something just really inspires and increases, shows what's possible,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.760
 kind of, you know, overwhelms us a little bit, even if we don't, you know, however we want to think

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:08.630
 about it, it's still, I mean, that's, I don't really have a question about anything in regard to

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.880
 that,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:15.360
 but it's just kind of the main point kind of that's coming across.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:22.160
 I think it's beautiful to, yeah, it's beautiful, I mean, just exactly what you're saying,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:28.880
 it's really so beautiful that if we, as Buddhist practitioners or anyone on a spiritual path,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.560
 the whole idea of continuing on a spiritual path is we have to see where we're getting stuck,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.240
 like, we have to see where we're holding onto things that, because we fear something and we're

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.670
 hoping for something, if we don't see those places that we're holding and grasping and more

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.400
 restricted,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:55.120
 more constricted, more contracted, if we don't see them and bring more air into them, loosen them

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.440
 up,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.360
 stop doing them, stop giving them fuel, the further causes to continue, we won't continue,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.560
 like, that's the end of our path, whether it's pride that makes us stop growing or it's doubt

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.800
 that makes us stop growing or it's being, you know, really aggressive and, like, repulsed against

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.920
 anything that would open us up to cause us to blossom more, like, there's activities of Guru

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:24.160
 Rinpoche and of Buddha Shakyamuni too, I mean, Buddha Shakyamuni is just so, just like the golden

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:33.520
 standard to how to be a perfect, perfectly balanced, totally harmonious being that, like, just was

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:33.760
 in

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.280
 sync with everything on every level, it's like, what a standard to, like, totally release all the

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:46.140
 ways that we're restricted and then Guru Rinpoche just, like, I mean, just what we see of him is

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.400
 this,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.000
 like, utter demonstration of how flexible and how wondrous and how amazing and how beneficial we

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.240
 can

00:28:52.240 --> 00:29:00.080
 be once we release these things, it's like they're giving us all, anything we need to say, as, like

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.080
,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.400
 standards or models, examples for why we should keep growing and how we can keep growing, like,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.280
 why we need to lessen these restrictions because there's so much more love we have, we don't need

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:18.000
 to fear being loved if we let go or fear being alone or whatever, but it's just beautiful in

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.600
 both ways, they're just these models for, like, how a path continues and, like, what we need to do

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:23.840
 to

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:31.600
 loosen up and become more functional and less restricted, it's beautiful in that, in that sense,

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.600
 like, seeing these stories of Guru Rinpoche and some, I know there's a usual response of it being,

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.240
 like, it's all myth or it's all fantasy or it's fantastical, how could someone be 15 years old?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.000
 And I think it's exactly that point, a thousand years old or however long these,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.920
 some of these great masters lived for centuries and it's because if we think of things as concrete

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.720
 things with concrete beginnings and concrete duration and concrete end, it doesn't make sense,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.560
 it's impossible because causes and conditions. If something has a definitive cause, it has to have

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:09.280
 a definitive end, that's the Buddha's teaching, but if it doesn't have a definitive cause or birth,

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.120
 it doesn't ever have to end and Guru Rinpoche, or this is, like, totally, like, shattered the sense

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.680
 of holding on to anything, like, any, it doesn't have a beginning, you know, as an eight-year-old

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.320
 boy,

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.280
 doesn't have an end, a horse appears and he magically, like, goes off and then reappears

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:32.240
 on the 10th day every, you know, I mean, it's just so incredible. I was curious, particularly,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:39.040
 speaking personally about this, you know, I remember there was definitely a time where

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.320
 a lot of the qualities, you know, of Guru Patmasambhava became kind of a hindrance to

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.800
 practice in that sense of, you know, it's doubt, because I think, particularly from the perspective

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:50.960
 of,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:58.400
 of, you know, it's reminded to us, again, again, you know, investigate, look, you know, be really

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.960
 scientific with it, and there's, there's no real way to investigate, you know, the, you know, the

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.240
 history of Patmasambhava, the qualities of Patmasambhava, there's, you know, so then, you know, but

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.560
 then

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.160
 at the same time, when you really start sinking into the view, then, you know, it gets more to

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.800
 what you were saying, it becomes inspiring, it creates that flexibility, it becomes, it really,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.480
 you know, it really ignites the teaching, and it really, you know, so how do you, how do you work

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:35.920
 with the doubt aspect to keep, sorry, I mean, one, one, I mean, just to remember, too, one of the

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:44.640
 activities of Guru Patmasambhava was he was a devoted student. He just, he studied with so many

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:53.040
 great masters. He studied, he practiced. He didn't just display all these things, all these

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.680
 miraculous

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.520
 activities, like that's all he did. He had the entirety of the Buddhist teachings in his mind.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:08.400
 He taught them. He studied with great masters and teachers for decades and decades and practiced.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.280
 And I think that too, even if, even if that's too remote, we can look at people in our own lif

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.760
etimes,

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.480
 our precious teachers who we've met, look at their qualities, what they've gone through in their

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:20.800
 life,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.600
 how we, what, how the, just some of the ways, you know, I know I have such limited vision, but

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:36.080
 can definitely see such benefit, you know, and just in a way, like that, like I think with the

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.520
 Buddhist teachings, or like anything, you need to have some degree of interest, some degree of,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:49.760
 you know, confidence in your own ability, and then explore, you know, with an open mind and an open

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:56.000
 heart, you know, like once you feel that, you want to follow. So I mean, I think that's how we

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.480
 conquered

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:03.010
 out, is we actually, like the Buddha said, you know, don't take my word for it, like take this,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.120
 like,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:12.560
 you know, merchant would examine the gold they're receiving, or really just study and practice.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.960
 Just the, in terms of devotion coming, because of, even if maybe you don't necessarily have a

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.160
 strong connection, at least in the beginning to Guru Parampasan Baba or Guru Shakyamuni,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.040
 or you know, you're just starting out, usually, you know, most people have some connection to

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.880
 the teachings or a teacher or something. And as we study the teachings more, whatever level of

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:44.240
 teachings, you know, we automatically it's like, where does these teachings come from? And then

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.760
 when we recall, oh, these teach these things, I'm reading this teachings, I'm receiving from my

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:56.000
 teachers, and, you know, this comes from the Buddha. And then it's can kind of be like, oh,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.680
 and this comes from Guru Parampasan Baba, like, like this last line in the says about how,

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:07.840
 like the specialness of, of Guru Shakyamuni and Guru Parampasan Baba in particular, among all the

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:13.760
 Buddhas, is that they came at this time, where we are now, and gave this teaching, and it's still

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:22.160
 available, available to us. And like, so that in itself is so miraculous, you know, so even before

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.040
 you even know much about Guru Parampasan Baba or the Buddha, but you, every single teaching you

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.600
 read,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:34.720
 every single teaching you receive is, is like, from their kindness and compassion for us.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.220
 So that's really special. That's true. As a quick note, maybe elaborate on that. Can anyone speak

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.360
 to

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.920
 maybe how the investigative mind can be on one end, prideful investigation, like in that sense

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.960
 of getting stuck in certain ways of doing investigation, other ways they open investigation,

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.760
 or maybe from your own practice, or from your own way relating to the teachings? Yeah, I've found

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.080
 something helpful in that, because I'm a very scientifically and doubt-minded person by nature.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:11.440
 But it's like, what I've seen, just like what, what all of you are saying, it's like, these, well,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.160
 one, you just come in contact with the teaching. Obviously, you might be interested in Buddhism,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.880
 if you're even listening to this, or engaged in the teaching. And when you hear the teaching,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:28.880
 there's just that basic sense of, this is like an otherworldly, profound, deep thing that I don't

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:37.360
 see right now. But there's that sense of, you know, of how vast and magical it is, and all the

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:37.840
 potential

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.120
 within it. You know, all you have to do is read a sutra, and you're like, oh my god, you know,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.480
 forget about reading the Tantra teachings, you know, it's like totally beyond where you are right

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.120
 now,

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:57.280
 for most people. So the point is, if we like Guru Padmasubhana, he was an elimination of Amitabha,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:04.240
 he was an elimination of Amitayas, he was an, he was a display of the nature. That's what the

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:11.840
 teaching says. He was the natural display. So for that, it's, yeah, it is, yeah, he's a, he's a, he

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:11.840
's

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.930
 a living Buddha. And in the nature is, you know, totally vast and open. That's what all the

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:18.800
 teachings

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.480
 say. That's what I, Buddha and Guru Padmasubhana could do, all those things that we normally

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.160
 consider to be impossible. Like one time, Rivetche said, oh, you know, just because they fly in the

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.600
 sky, or do this, and transmute the elements, or live for a long time. Well, that seems like magic.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 You know, they're like, that seems unnatural, that seems impossible. They're like, actually,

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:48.080
 that's the most natural thing ever, because the nature is totally open in freedom status.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:54.000
 You know, the nature of mind, the nature of reality is completely open. And if you're engaging in

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.720
 investigation, from the standpoint of what I see right now, is the only thing that could exist.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.880
 It's just like, good luck. Two-year-old will only see the two-year-old world. A ten-year-old will

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.570
 only see the ten-year-old world. You know, it's just like, that's, if you come from that

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.480
 perspective,

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.600
 then where you are right now, you take to be the absolute final definitive view. But then you must

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:23.920
 be enlightened. You must be totally enlightened. If you have that view, my view is the only one

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.000
 that

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.200
 can be possible. Okay, you're fully enlightened being then, because your view must include the

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:35.440
 whole vastness of everything. So, we have to leave room, I mean, we don't have to, but if we want

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:35.600
 to

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.760
 keep going, have to leave room for possibility that we don't see the full picture right now.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.400
 And if we don't see the full picture, by practicing the teachings, all you have to do is look at

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.560
 the

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:53.120
 examples like Raya says, or like Drapa says. The fact is, millions of beings have attained

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.400
 enlightenment by practicing these teachings, really countless infinite beings. So, if we take that

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:58.640
 and

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.480
 if we, if we even connect with one being who is at that state, you know, at that high level, like

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.800
 they said, we follow their example, and the proof is in the pudding. You practice the teachings of

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:16.240
 Guru Palma Subhana, you will attain enlightenment. And that demonstrates that Guru Palma Subhana is

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.080
 coming from within that natural state, and that anything's possible in that state.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:29.120
 And it seems too, kind of, what Lodo was asking, and also what maybe it would look like, distilling

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:39.440
 some of what Angie was saying. That part of, if we, the difference between doubt, that, I guess it

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:39.680
 sounds

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:51.360
 like, there's a difference between investigating something with a really set, set of an agenda or

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:59.840
 something. Yeah, you know. And then there's investigating something with, to the best of

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:08.080
 our ability, with using our intelligence and our logic and an honest, hard, you know, an open,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.760
 kind of, investigation in that sense. Using
