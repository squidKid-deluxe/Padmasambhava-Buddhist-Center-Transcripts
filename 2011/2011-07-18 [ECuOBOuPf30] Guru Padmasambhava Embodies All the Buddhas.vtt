00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.340
 Welcome, welcome everyone. As you all know, today or this morning, I'm going to offer the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.000
 empowerment of the Guru Padmasambhava, known as Dehikundi, or Dechijapu.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 Or, the Guru Padmasambha, that embodies all the sogatas, which is known as the king of the great

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.000
 blessings, that embodies all the sogatas, all the Buddhas of three times in ten directions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 So that is the empowerment that I'm going to offer you this morning.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.150
 Now, I'm going to give great introductions of this ceremony, or the involvement, which is part of

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.000
 the involvement itself, which is part of the lineage, the whole involvement of the system.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And so I'm going to give great introductions of this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 These introductions are part of our talk about the Guru Padmasambha.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Generally, this week, the two week, is our week of the great teacher, the Guru Padmasambha.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.100
 We're going to explore all the different levels, the meanings of the Guru Padmasambha, and how we

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.000
 can make ourselves as beautiful beings in this world.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So that we can continually be beauty.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 This life, and the next life, and the life after life.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.420
 As you know, the Buddhism, life is not just the beginning here, nor is ending here, it's the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.000
 continuation.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.800
 As their progress, as weak progress, as year progress, as central progress, as millennial progress,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.000
 our life continually progress and move forward.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 It's the same rhythm, same echoes, nature is the same, moving forward, continuing. But growing, and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 beautifully igniting, glorifying, that is our responsibility.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.970
 Make something beautiful, make something special, not just a drunken, boring, and whole, moving

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.000
 with heavy burdens, move with light, with joy, and appreciation for all those beautiful glories.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 That is the responsibility of ours, yours, and mine, and everyone's.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 In order to ignite that beautiful glorytus, then greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni Ghee, many

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000
 different levels and categories of teaching.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 How to improve, how to make battle, how to make beautiful ourselves, that we can beauty to others.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.400
 With the context of harmony, peaceful, non-volence, pernicious, appreciation, and a big joy. That

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.000
 is the whole song, the whole mark, teaching of the greatest teacher of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 We are followers of that greatest teacher. How wonderful, how beautiful we are.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.030
 We are the one of the most beautiful beings that who really like to make difference to ourselves,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.000
 to others.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 In this context, then as I said, there are many different levels and categories of the teachings.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Today's teaching is one of the very esoteric teachings.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 That means, what means esoteric?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.210
 It targets, exactly the pinpoint of the nature itself. It's not just a power ring and not just a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.000
 kind of going around, pointing out to the right on the should be.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 And this is known as then esoteric, skillful means of teaching of compassion. Compassion, that is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.000
 the word of the teachings.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 In these contexts, there are many different categories of the teachings.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.100
 Then the empowerment is one of the very, very powerful skillful means of the teachings that Buddha

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.000
 gives.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 There are many different methods, many different ways to explore and bring these beauties.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 But this empowerment is known as one of the very powerful and special methods.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.110
 And we are going to discover and use this empowerment through the teaching of the, again, Buddha

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.990
 with the contracts by the Buddha Shakyamuni, according to that contracts, according to that lineage

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000
.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 As Buddha Shakyamuni, Gaurabhayam Mahasambhava, highlighted that teachings.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 That is again the purpose of the MNA, human Gaurabhayam Mahasambhava.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni came 3,600 years ago.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 He gave, on the relative level or in the common level, he gave sutra teaching.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 That means very general teaching, how to make ourselves a better person, beautiful person.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 How to make ourselves happy, pure and peaceful.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Make happy and pure and peaceful to the others and bring them, bring beautiful qualities.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 That is what the Buddha gives, general common teachings.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.550
 But then Buddha give in higher level, Buddha Shakyamuni give, higher level this great sutra or the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.000
 tantra teachings.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Teachings which is not ready to explore that time or to explore that time in India.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So he gave in higher levels.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Higher levels and this teaching be very, very popular.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 These teachings are very popular in the celestial realms.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 The realm beyond our two hours, our two years, in our conceptions.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 There is many realms.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 There is many things to discover.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.150
 As scientists discover, as we know, there is even more to discover than what modern scientists

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.000
 discover.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And so these teachings are very popular in those higher realms.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 And because of that, because when the time is ready in this world, in this earth,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 then Guru Prahmana Sambha purposely emanated to explore or to bring and to highlight, bring thought

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 and available to us.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 This is one of the great, most powerful activity of greatest, again, teacher, Guru Prahmana Sambha.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:49.340
 To bring thought, the hidden teaching on the spotlight so that we can all can experience and

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.000
 benefit by these teachings.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 As we are ready, as we are prepared.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 So this sutra teaching or the tantra teaching is one of the very special teaching those ways.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.720
 Now, with that understanding about the Guru Prahmana Sambha, I already said and you already know

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.000
 that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 But again, knowing is not just enough. We have to activate it. We have to practice.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 This is the whole purpose of our practice, not just knowing.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Knowing is good, it is an intellectual status.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 But it is not really sipping and coming to the heart.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.030
 And when it is not letting come to the heart, it is still in the intellectual, up in the floating

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.000
 status.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Floating, hovering, as I said, other day.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 It is hovering and floating, floating.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 If it is not sinking and holding in the heart center, heart.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.770
 So therefore, again, we have to first, we have to know, then we have to do that teaching and

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.000
 observe in the heart.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And now, upon Guru Prahmana Sambha, with that.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Guru Prahmana Sambha can understand external level and very personal levels.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 External level, as I said, Guru Prahmana Sambha is known as two ways.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 First, Guru Prahmana Sambha is known as the direct emanation of the living Buddha Amitabha,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 who is residing in the west direction of our universe.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 As I said, there is more universe, more planets than our true eyes and true ears can handle.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Actually, there are so many.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.250
 These are, there are so many universe, in each direction, west direction, south and north, in the

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.000
 corner direction.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 South, west, west, north, whatever you call, up and down, there are so many universe.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 There are so many also, the pure lands.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 The land that is completely filled with the highly enlightened beings.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 That means, enlightened beings, what means?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 The beings are filled with their heart, with love, unconditional love, unconditional compassion,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 unconditional compassion, wisdom.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And the wisdom, knowledge that has no grasping and no clinging.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Open, vast, deep, as sky and oceans.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 There are so many beings.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Those beings are filled with that pure land, or lands.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 That land is known as pure lands.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 So pure land of the Buddha Amitabha is full of blessings,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and blessings to Him.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Full of love, and compassion, and wisdom.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 There is no violence, there is no struggling.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Because there is no negative emotions.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And that, in that pure land, there is a living Buddha, known as Buddha Amitabha,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 in the name of You, known and heard in practice.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 From the heart center of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 golden weather, with five points.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Whenever you know this weather, this is very sacred, famous, holy, ritual object,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 sacred objects, objects.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Like this formation, the light came as lightening

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 to the center of Lake Dhanakosha, in the northwest border of India.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 It's called Odhiana, known as Odhiana, in that border.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 According to the teachings, when you read the books and the teachings,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 it's not just exactly in Odhiana.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 It's northwest, even, border of also Odhiana, I see it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 But it descended this formation as lightening with the soft and gentle

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 in the middle of the lotus, the blooming pole petal lotus,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 one thousand petal lotus.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Immediately, the beautiful being appeared, and which is Mgolapamasa.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 As egg-year-old, bold, beautiful, calm, soothing, peaceful,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 appeared, and so appeared, is that body of light, and love, and compassion.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And this is not about how Mgolapamasa appeared in this work, there.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And then there's another also, teachings, when Mgolapamasa became this work.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 As I said, Bodharshaktamune gave the common teachings

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 on the public level, publics, in India at that time,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 but higher teachings he gave in the slasher ends, because which is not ready.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 But now the teachings have to come to this world,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 because the worlds, the beings are ready to receive the highest teaching of the Vedyan.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Therefore, Bodharshaktamune also purposely reincarnated as Mgolapamasa.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.110
 And that, in the teachings said, when Bodharshaktamune announced his Mahaparin nirvana around the

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.000
 80s,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 many Sangha members and close disciples,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 particularly Ananda, who has been as attendant of Bodharshaktamune over 30 years,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 he felt very, very upset by the announcement of Bodharshaktamune going to enter Mahaparin nirvana,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 which commonly we can language used as passing way, going to pass way.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.340
 But it's called Mahaparin nirvana, because it's not just passing with frightening fears and

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.000
 suffering with sadness.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Buddha is going to enter the new dimensional levels of the reality of the true nature.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Realitally, the death and the birth are the two sides of the coins. There's no difference.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 It's two sides of the day and the night aspect. There's no difference.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 What is the difference? Because there is death, that's the birth is death.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Because there's birth, there is death. It's the same way.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Because night, there was because daylight. There is day, there is night.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 This is just two sides of the coin. That is calm.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 This is the one that echoes of natures. Everything is like that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 There is all that beauties. This is in Goda's teaching known as skillful means and wisdom.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 A pairing and an emptiness is all the same games. Nothing difference. Both are both.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 So, Buddha means announced that. But really Buddha announced that.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 However, the huwa has and they're not completely free from the duality and the grasping, clinging.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And because with habit patterns, they feel upset.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 See some separations, some changes going to come.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Particularly, Anand get very choked, very personal. They get very upset.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And Buddha said, Anand should not feel sad.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And I will be back at years from Mahabharata death.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 I will born as even better than what I am now.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And how my name will be known as Mgurupa Muslim.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Therefore, you Ananda and it shouldn't worry. Shouldn't you say that?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Buddha announced that and said that.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Not just only that, Buddha repeatedly predicted the upcoming of the Mgurupa Sambaba and Mene.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Mene, sotaras and tantras.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Often our great Kinti Parthisharama said there were over 21 or 20 sotara tantras.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.540
 But there are predicted and mentioned of the Mgurupa Sambaba coming in this world by Buddha Shakti

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.000
 Mene.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 So therefore, Mgurupa Sambaba is in that way reincarnation of worry,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 our greatest teacher, the pondering father of the Buddhism,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Buddha Shakti Mene, emanations, a period and form of Mgurupa Mene.
