00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.860
 We are trying to discover the terma teaching from the Garuda Rocky Mountains.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.580
 The teacher is very interested in teaching. It is a very interesting story. Just every day, when

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:56.840
 they revert, they are teaching. From an external object, there are fascinating events happening. So

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.000
 he is here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.230
 When he began to discover the terma teaching, he began to dig in the hole. It becomes what is

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:22.540
 called geological excavator, and he began to really dig the Rocky Mountains as he identified the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 exact location.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:51.610
 This is his whole story of this Rinalovashe. But anyway, all the instructions, in a way, he got

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.000
 every instruction as to how to do it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 That is what he is doing now. However, he still had trouble.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.370
 When he started digging the hole or curbing the Rocky Mountains at that moment, he was at that time

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.000
, I think, about eight or thirty years old.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.150
 Twenty-seven years, when he was old, he received the instructions and all that. He had to wait for

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.000
 three years with a lot of preparation and meditation and practice and so forth.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.300
 So when all that came, he was at thirty and now he began to revel in digging. But the moment he

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.000
 started doing that, that is what Rinalovashe himself said.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.910
 There is a moment where there is a lot of lightning and thunder, and the hellstorms came as big as

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.000
 the egg, egg-sized hellstorms, and then also a lot of what is called boulders.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.720
 Boulders are falling from the mountain as rain of the boulders, as the size of the heads of the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.000
 sheep coming with sound toward them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:49.540
 So Rinalovashe turned and then the spotter who was an assistant, they all scared, scared, and they

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.000
 were very scared.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And then he heard that Rinalovashe himself said to pray to Murphema Sambho.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.630
 And he said, he made also a statement, "If I'm the true Tehtung, that as you instructed me, true Te

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.000
htung, then I shouldn't have this much trouble."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 He said, "If I'm not that person, then do what we like to do."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.520
 So when Rinalovashe turned to Murphema Sambho, he said, "And then the moment he met the stone, pray

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.000
 to Murphema Sambho."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And right that moment, the hellstone, as well as those falling rocks, immediately stopped.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:56.980
 So when Rinalovashe turned to Murphema Sambho, he said, "That's how Rinalovashe discovered the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.000
 first time, his Tehtung teachings."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And then after that, again the chairman will continue using the example of Rinalovashe.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.070
 And he said, "After that, also Rinalovashe began to discover another Tehtung teaching, in the close

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.000
 of his birthplace."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 A place known as Lobra Kastra. And Lobra is the place where Rinalovashe was born.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 When Rinalovashe was born, at that time, he got more confident, in a way, I think.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.180
 He also announced to many villagers that, "This day, I'm going to discover the Tehtung teaching,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.000
 and from these places, you all come."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And you can participate, you can participate with the meditation of practices, that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 So he really gathered quite larger, larger those practitioners or the devotees.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Then he did the ceremonies, prayers, and all those ceremonies, all that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 But again, he started digging the hole on the Rocky Mountains.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 When he started digging the hole, he couldn't find anything else.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 And so he couldn't find. He couldn't find. Again, he did the same. He prayed to Rinalovashe.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And so when he started praying to Rinalovashe, and when he did that, at that moment,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 the Dharmapala, who was protecting that Tehtung, that Tehtung, that Dharmapala, known as Ginnimkare

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 and he ate it.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And then he took this very intense moment, moment, and so Rinalovashe prayed that,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 at that moment, that Dharmapala, he prayed right in front of every audience,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 in the form of a white man and a white horse, came, and he pointed.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 "What's that?" He said, "This is what's called a horse, you have this one."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And then he came there with the white man and the white horse,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 and he pointed his, like this, the whip to the exact location of that road.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 This is the place that your dharma is here, and now I am giving the father's aid

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 to the son, to whom, or son, whom have to give, that father's aid.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Now, exactly, I just, I did my job, that means.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So I kept this father's aid, or father's wealth, that have to give to the son.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 You're the son, that son, and now I give to you."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 He said that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 So then all the audience, or the crowd saw, saw that, that clearly.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And then he was able to discover that there,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 and then everybody was amazed to Rinalaba and his teachings.
