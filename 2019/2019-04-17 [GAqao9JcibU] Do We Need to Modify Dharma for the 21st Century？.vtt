00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Thank you, Rinpoche. I was wondering about today, in your teaching, where you're going through the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.970
 importance of completing nandro, keeping it up, doing korte rushen, doing trek choy practice, all

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.000
 these foundational elements to make Togol what it is.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.980
 So I was wondering, would you talk a little bit about, I guess, first, how that same sequence would

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.340
 be done traditionally, in terms of the elements of having to study also, and then they're also

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.000
 always talking about serving the mandala and teacher things, and then three-root practice.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.270
 So, the first part is how that fits into how it has been done for centuries, and then the second

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:01.000
 part is, is anything being modified, or what's changing to do that now?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 So, I think maybe this is through the kindness and the wisdom of the morning scientifics, and it is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 covered, covered, distractions between organic and not organic.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.460
 And before the science, I don't know if anybody will know too much the difference there is, but

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 your food is food.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.280
 But now, they're really seeing the organic food, saturated in the propagated food, has big

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 difference.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So same way, what we are going through here now, and through centuries from that, is organic.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.910
 Organic of true wisdom and compassion, free from any negative, any more arrogance, arrogance and

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.000
 superiors, or easy way to do this and that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Those are all consultants, those are all ego tricks.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.320
 That really worked. In the past, historians, especially when Buddhism came, there's many like that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.000
 started.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 And then, it is really refined by one another, and those who follow with that, they didn't got good

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.000
 results.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 They become like following, following on the clips, that.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 But we want to follow the lineage teaching, it is win-win situation, win-win situation.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Each time, they got big courage and commitment, and joy, not just surface levels.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.900
 With their hard time, difficult time, desperate time, their courage and commitment, and joy and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.000
 vision is ever stronger than that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.750
 They care it. Not just in the sunshine, good practitioners, in the thunderstorm, they're not

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.000
 practitioners.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 They're true in all the time, they have been followed.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.040
 So, this organic dharma teaching, I really see this modern scientific, I've discovered that this

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.310
 kind of organic things enough to perceive the saturated food, the chemical food, and in fact, the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.000
 side food, and organically growing food, these things.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 This dharma is inner food, inner nourishment.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.200
 It's not just for a short time, for people who can't relate to trick the brains and to create easy

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.000
 touch.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.360
 Every day is an easy way to move that. All of us are so kind, so compassionate, so considerate to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.000
 all of the beings.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 I'm sure they say, "Oh, you do what you like to do." It's okay.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 But it won't. The emotions are stronger, negatives are stronger, and the ego clings are stronger.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 The ego gets stronger, the ego gets stronger, stronger, stronger, and then begins to see everything

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.000
, not to cooperate with this decision either.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 They just say, kind of almost like taking drops of the spiritual push-out time to make easy that.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So, that is really my interpretation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.670
 Following the organic way and with devotion and all that, I think that's what really all these

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.000
 great realisation beings, one after another, boom, one after another,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 all that, boom. So, that's really the traditional way and following that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.390
 Those are, I mean, this is just organic. Even though it is difficult, I'm sure the farmers have the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.000
 difficulty to produce organic as well as this,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 but it is being rewarded. So, that's my interpretation.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Okay, let me start.
