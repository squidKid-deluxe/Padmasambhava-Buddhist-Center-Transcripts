00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I was wondering if you could give us a pith instruction that includes all of the pith instructions?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Just blend one's own mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I think there's a Buddha game already.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.940
 Not engaging, or trying to not engage into any negative activities, and always perform that as much

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.000
 as we can do with choose.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 With choose means good thought, good heart, and then calm down your mind, or one's own mind.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 This is the teaching of the Buddha, or this is my teaching. That's what Buddha says.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.730
 Thank you, Richard. How does it include all the pith instructions? Will you explain how it includes

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.000
 all of them?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Some teachers say not engaged in any negative activity, it is the essence of the Vinaya teachings.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Perform all the virtuous activities, and that is like sutta teachings, essence.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Then, just blend one's own mind, and that's the really teaching of the Abhidhana.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So this three pitaka, this basket teaching, is the combined contents of all the Buddha teachings.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Thank you very much.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.770
 And then also, it is the morality, concentration, and wisdom, three extraordinary trainings of the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 Buddhas.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Thank you.
