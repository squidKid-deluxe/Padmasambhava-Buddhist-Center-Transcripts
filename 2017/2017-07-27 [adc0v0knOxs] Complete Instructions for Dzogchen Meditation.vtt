NOTE     "synopsis": "Complete Instructions for Dzogchen Meditation\nby Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nDorje Drolo Dzogchen Retreat\nPadma Samye Ling\nJuly 22, 2017\n\nA Dzogchen Overview\n\n\"Sentient beings have diverse capacities for understanding the true nature. This is why the Buddha gave so many different teachings. These teachings are like a vast banquet with all kinds of delicious dishes suitable to every taste.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s teachings can be grouped into three levels. The foundation level is the Hinayana, the second level is the Mahayana, and the third and highest level is the Vajrayana. All of the Hinayana teachings are contained in the Mahayana, and all of the Hinayana and Mahayana teachings are contained in the Vajrayana. This means the Vajrayana is the complete teaching of the Buddha.\n\nThe masters of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism divided the Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana into nine levels or yanas. Yana can be translated into English as \u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201ccarrier.\u201d In the same way we just discussed, the first yana is contained in the second, the first and second yanas are contained in the third, and so on, until we reach the ninth and ultimate yana: Dzogchen. Dzogchen means \u201cGreat Completion\u201d or \u201cGreat Perfection,\u201d because it alone contains all the previous eight yanas, as well as itself. This means that Dzogchen is the all-encompassing, whole, complete teaching of the Buddha.\n\nOver the centuries many people who practiced Dzogchen reached the highest levels of realization. While many people have attained the highest realization by practicing the teachings of other Buddhist schools, even more have done so within the Nyingma lineage through the practice of Dzogchen. Why is this? It is because Dzogchen is so clear, direct, and powerful. It is well known that many Dzogchen practitioners achieved the transcendental wisdom rainbow body. Other Dzogchen practitioners who did not achieve the rainbow body, and who are not known to future generations by titles like \u201cgreat lama,\u201d or \u201cmahasiddha,\u201d still achieved complete realization of the true nature. In humble, simple, quiet ways, these practitioners reached the ultimate goal of life.\n\nIn general, when we practice Dzogchen we accumulate and\naccomplish the two merits of skillful means and wisdom in union. If we separate skillful means and wisdom, and choose one and reject the other, our practice is not all-encompassing and complete, and is therefore no longer Dzogchen. In particular, this Aro teaching is based more on wisdom. In other words, it focuses on view and meditation. It is grounded more on the absolute level since it is a direct teaching on the true nature. Even so, if we want to actualize this teaching we still must practice it through the union of skillful means and wisdom.\n\nDzogchen is the highest teaching, and Dzogchen practitioners are of the highest capacity. The first of the Aro teachings, which we have already touched upon, are for high capability practitioners of the highest caliber. For these people the universe and their own minds are inseparable in the enlightened state. They experience all phenomena as pure, and do not create divisions such as \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject.\u201d They abide in nonduality. With regard to their understanding, there is nothing to add and nothing to subtract, nothing to gain and nothing to lose\u2014everything is in the Great Completion, Great Perfection state. Whether their minds are abiding or moving\u2014nothing changes. Quiet and peaceful mind, active mind\u2014it is all the same. Nor do they distinguish between meditation and post-meditation. Whatever comes, moves, changes, and goes is the manifestation of the natural state, spacious and free. These practitioners are beyond hope and fear of both samsara and nirvana. The teaching here says, \u201cOriginally enlightened\u2014both appearance and mind itself.\u201d Truly, for these practitioners everything is fulfilled. For the rest of us, this level of fulfillment is close at hand, even imminent, as long as we keep practicing.\"\n\nVenerable Khenpo Rinpoches\nThe Nature of Mind\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.980
 When you do the meditation, generally meditation means maintaining and being in the natural states.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 That is really what is the meaning of the meditation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Meditation means being in the natural state, being in that state.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And so, to be in the natural state, then present our mind is not the natural state.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Present our mind is completely on the unnatural state.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.770
 Unnatural state. Unnatural state is what is. All these conceptions, all these turbulence of the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.000
 emotions,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.390
 ups and downs, back and forth, all this booziness is never letting us to be relaxed and be in the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.000
 natural state.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.890
 We are carried by the force of this wind of the unnatural energy of the conception that manifests

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 from mind to you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And the conception itself is empty, is like turbulence, turbulence of the wind.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Of course, wind is like foam, but this time this conception has no foam.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It is nothing substantially existing, yet it is disturbing carried us from the natural state to the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 unnatural state of conception itself.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That is it. In that time, then what we experience, we are all so much tired of our mind sometimes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Those of us who are so tired, what is it that is called?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Excites, deep rations, and our lower psychological problems.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And all that, all that starts from the mind.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And the mind is empty. There is nothing substantially solid existing at all.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I mean, that is not the way we are talking. I am not talking the story of Buddha.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Buddha is not talking the story of the power behind of the galaxies.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Truly, Buddha is pointing out exactly where our mind, our nature is.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 So we look to ourselves. Is mind really existing? There is something. No, it is not.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 So now, for that reason, we have to relax. We have to rest.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 When we relax, that terminology in Buddhism is gone.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And we need to be the Buddhism translated as gone.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And Sanskrit is Dayan, and English translated as meditation.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Now we are meditating.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And meditation is nothing else besides relax on the mind.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 It has nothing to do with religion, that tradition, this and that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 It has nothing to do.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 It is just simple, relaxing our mind on the natural calm, peaceful status.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That is it. There is nothing else.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.650
 In order to do this, then, first of all, gracious teaching, all those lineage masters always make

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 As I said, every time I say it, you all bring more joy and appreciation.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 To start this, to start our practice, to start meditation, bring more joy and appreciation.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And to do this, it is simple to tell, reflecting on the four points.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Those are the precious life and impermanent, and cause and condition are inevitable.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Of cause and condition, its results are inevitable, and samsara, or the world, has challenge.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Challenge, reflect, those are the four points.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 We start reflecting to those.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Those are the truly occurring phenomena on this phenomenal world.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Reality level, of course, they are also really not solid, permanent.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Conquered, truly existing, but they are illusion.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:41.140
 But yet, they are truly occurring, happening, ongoing phenomena, all ongoing, going this place in

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.000
 this world.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 First is, as I said, joy and appreciation.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 That is a reflection of our precious life.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Life is precious.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Life is beautiful.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 When we start reflecting how precious, how beautiful this is, our own life, each of our lives,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 and the lives of everyone too, not just our own mind.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Every one of our lives is precious.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 But start with me, with you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 You, life is precious, beautiful.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.340
 And with that, reflecting, thinking of that, or reflecting that thought, more joy and more

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.000
 appreciation.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 More grateful, more graceful.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 More graceful, grateful, joy and appreciation, our life, our situation, our circumstance,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 and our friends, family, in all, every situation, really.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 All that, we do things.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And I like that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 I like that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Of course, we have some difficult troubles in our lives, these things.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 But when we start to practice and meditate, we have to highlight our goodness aspects.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 We're going to practice from the light to light, not from dark to dark, and a darker and a darker.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 That is not good practices.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 That's not going to help us.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 That will drain down us to the ditch, ditch, and then put on in the big holes.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 We're going to lift it up ourselves from any situations.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 When we do this, we're going to do joy and appreciation.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Bring gracefulness.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Graceful, bring joy and appreciation, bring gracefulness, gratitude to every aspect in our lives.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Should be grateful.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Should be.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 This is not just happened by accidentally, according to Buddhism teachings.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Everything what we see, it has cause, it has condition.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Behind the scenes, behind the scenes, part of the senses.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 That all of these situations, really.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Every one of those causes and conditions mixed up won't have this situation.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 That means when we have the beautiful situation, that means every cause and condition

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 lines up our favor to happen to that beauty, that goodness.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Therefore, bring joy and appreciation and more gracefulness.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 When we do that, what?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 It will bring also really meaningful our lives.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It will bring also our heart is more softer, more tender, more nice.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 It become nicer to your, one's own self.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It make brain nicer in such a beautiful environment to my family, our own family,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 friend, and to neighbors to everyone.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 And that is big, that is known as practicing dharma in Buddhism.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 This is not just isolated, kind of like we are doing some digital.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 That is the central column, one of the central column of the practice of the Buddha-Dharma.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 By joy and appreciation, how good, how precious life is.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Then, next one is impermanence.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Therefore, you know, nothing is ever lasting.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Everything is moving.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 On the gross level, on the subtle levels.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Gross level, how might things change in our sense we have the memory until now.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 This is not just only happening our time.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 That happened in the past too.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And this is happening now.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And it will happen also in the future too.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 This is called impermanence.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Impermanence is nothing bad.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Impermanence is not this related to the phenomenon.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 That way things are happening.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Happening.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So it is not ever going to last forever.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 As I said, on the gross level, on the subtle levels.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Subtle level.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 If there is nothing happening, change in the subtle level,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 gross change impermanence is never going to come.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Even though we don't detract from the subtle change,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 it is pushing and making this gross change.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 This all things happen.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 From the time to our asking to now,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 how many things really changed?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 To our self.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And from our physical, from our idea,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 our mental capability, even my self or our ego or our self,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 how many things have changed?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 These will do continue this.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So therefore, everything is changing and not reflecting that thought.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 That situation is important.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 You are looking truly, exactly as the way things are.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 We are not ignoring that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 We are not looking in other direction and ignoring realities.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 We should see where things are.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 When we look closer to the way things are changing all these things,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 what it does, it making our again, heart is more subtle, more tender, more nicer.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 It will also help us to have more common senses

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 so that we can deal in this world,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 something more kind of nicely, more beautiful,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 not clashing and not kind of bumping all the time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Something more down to the earth, down to the ground,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 more humble, more simple, yet performed in the continuing, advancing.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 That really bad brain is.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 At the same time, this spiritual love, even though love is so pretty, so beautiful,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 this is not going to last forever.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Therefore, we should have to, by seeing this environment,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 we should have the courage and the commitment to use, take the opportunity.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Well, everything is in our situation.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Our hand, really take the opportunity.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Do good things to myself, good things to others.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Others.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 And we do that.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 That we are fulfilling our goal, fulfilling our purpose of very life, this life.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Something is happening.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Something really you made impression to yourself, to the others.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Others.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Therefore, have courage and commitment.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And then, next one point is cause and condition.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 When cause and condition come together and comes in, result is inevitable.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Result is inevitable.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 That is, again, the role and the nature of the phenomenon.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Everything you see, what we see here now,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 it has cause, it has condition.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 With all the cause and condition, never come anything.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Never came, never coming or not coming, will never come anything.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Anything.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Therefore, we should do something good.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Every something we do good, it will reflect good.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 That is the system.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 That is the way of phenomenon.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Good brings good, bad brings bad.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Posen seed will bring and condition posen fruits.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Medicine seed will bring medicine seed.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 There.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 And then, in the mental level, what?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Love and kindness bring love and kindness.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Anger brings anger.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Hated will bring hate.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Violence brings violence.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 That way of the system.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Therefore, we should try to always line it up and kind of line it up

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 and then add one second, toward doing something good things.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Best of love and kindness and compassion.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Compassion and really good for you and good for the other.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 That not going to go forever.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 That is not just did that moment and then free.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 That ripple effect, chain reaction, continuous goes on and on.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 According to Buddha's teaching, that will go a long time.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Whatever we do, activity, that is not just going to disappear right there

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 or right after whatever we did, it goes on.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 And more than that, according to Buddha's teaching,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 we bring something to our mental status.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Mental status as eye closed, more than time.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 We printed something.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 We registered something, mental status.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 And from that mental status, eye closed,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 when you were searching, when your tongue comes,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 it will reflect again, reflect again.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 This is the way things are.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 And that is what in Buddhism, known as karma.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 This is karma.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Therefore, we should always, when we know that, what we have to do.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 We are always thoughtful, always mindful.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Mindful to every other actions and trying to do the good.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Good is good. It will bring good.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Bad is bad. It will bring bad.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 If it's big, it will bring big bad.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 If it's big bad, it will bring big bad.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 If it's small, it's bad, it brings small bad.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 If it's big good, it brings big good.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And a small good, small good.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 But the ripple, ripple chin reaction goes on and on.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 On, in a way multiplies.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Multiplies.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 So therefore, always thoughtful to every other actions.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 With mindfulness, trying to always strive.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Strive or drive toward good activities.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 And good activities with what?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Why? It becomes known as good, good.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Because it starts with love. It starts with compassion.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 It starts with kindness that you have in your heart and mind.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 When that action is reflected, it's called good activities.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Activity of love and kindness and compassion.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And kindness, kindness when it comes to the action.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 That's called good actions.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And activities of anger and jealous, hated, towards, cares.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 That's called bad activities.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 So trying to really activate more love and more complicated activities.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Those are known as kindness.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 If you do this, what it also will bring?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It will bring more ourself, more reward, more in quality.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 It will also really bring more kindness.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Yourself will feel happy, "Yo, I'm doing good."

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And also your friend and family member also will appreciate more.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 More they will see, see benefit above.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And therefore they will go more comfortable and happy.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 That is this reward.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Reward in that moment to ask to the family.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 But not just that.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It's called brother's duty. It goes on.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 It goes on. Have so many benefits, one after the others.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Others, all of them.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 And then, next one is samsara.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 This world has troubles.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 World is not pure land or heaven.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 This is in samsara.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 We have difficulty to doubt the father of this world.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Poor.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 This is nothing again unusual.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 That happened in the past too.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And when you read history, how many things came?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 We read.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And how many things are now changing?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 Happening.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And how many others will go on in the future too?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So therefore, by seeing this, reflecting this, this, we should.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Should be more strong, more kind, more compassion.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And really happy.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Everyone, no matter what you are going through,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 or whatever, everyone needs kindness.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Everyone needs compassion.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Everyone needs love.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And we really kind of wish, pray, love and kindness

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 and compassion for all, everyone.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 We are doing something, very good contribution to the world.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And also it will subside some review of all this difficulty

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 to change what they are going through.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 So those are known as poor points.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And many of you know this.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 It's nothing new that I'm talking.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 But I'm just reminding to all of us,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 that's what the greatest teacher, Buddha, said.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 The meaning and the purpose of the Sangha is

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 to help each other, support each other,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 remind each other.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 That's what the greatest teacher said.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 So in a way, I'm reminded to all of us.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I'm reminded to myself, I'm reminded to yourself.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 To you all.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 So that is generally, every time,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 every kind is reflecting of this thought before the practices.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 For example, during the application and both each other

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 and then purely to understand the words and all that I said.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 But after that, we are trying,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 just reflecting on those four points.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Four points.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Breaks to life, impermanence,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 and cause and effect is resolved by inevitable

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 and samsara or world has challenged in a difficulty.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 The poor thought is known as, is reflecting.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And it will, again, all that will make what always in the teachings,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 it will make, as I've repeated many times,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 it will make our heart is more soft,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 heart is more tender and more practical,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 more common in senses,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 and not just always carry the bubbles of the air of wellness,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 all that kind of that.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 It will bring us to the ground,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 the ground where we are standing.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 From there, we can grow and develop that.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 So it makes beautiful thoughts.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 So reflect those thoughts in a short time,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 and then after that, if you have time, for example,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 now I'm talking, you're going to meditate more,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 one session, for example, one hour, half hour,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 if you have time to meditate there, silence meditation.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Then, same way as we did, do the lineage prayers.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 It's full of devotions, joy and appreciation.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Devotion is, again, another very special calling of the mind.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Mind opens a door of our heart and mind

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 so that all the blessings can come in our heart and mind

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 so that we can activate our Buddha nature.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Our Buddha nature is the sunlight,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 sunlight that comes to our Buddha nature,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 see it, and that will make growth of our really Buddha nature.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So therefore, again, have strong devotions

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 with those who do the lineage prayers.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 After lineage prayers, then you do the meditation.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Meditation, as meditation, as always,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 says two meditations.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Two meditations are known as Samadhi meditation

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 and Vipassana meditation.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Samadhi meditation and Vipassana meditation,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 again, I said many times, and many of you already know,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 it's not something you don't know,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 but I said before, if you can have time,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 you have time, do your time, Samadhi meditation.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 That is really concentrating your mind,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 and not let go to any way, just be concentrated on the object.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 That object, you can put some object in front of you

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 as Buddha stages, or small marble,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 or whatever you can put, and concentrate on that.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 That all is simply watching, breathing, by the breeze.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Then, hurry to the other day meditations with the good postures.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 That means, if you are sitting on the floor,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 if you have a good leg, no troubles,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 try to set semi-lottled postures.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Sitting on the floor with the semi-regular postures

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 or lot of the postures.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 The back spans are very straight up,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 and then hold your hands towards both hands,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 and join together as an equal name in Madhura,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 right below the narrow center,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 and then eyes are looking towards the tip of the nose,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 let it down, or semi-open, semi-close,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 and close your mouth, and let the air come,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 breathing come from nostril, very gentle,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 exactly where your breath is nothing to change.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And now, relax in your mind,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 that whatever you concentrate on, that status.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And stay for that status, whatever you have time for.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Five minutes, every say, five minutes, three minutes,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 really trying to stay there.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 So that means, you're making some really effort,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 effort and forceful to stay mind with that object of concentrations,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 making that effort, you're making that.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 And that is known as Samatha Meditation, breathing status.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Once you're able to maintain your mind,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 most stabilize, kind of let it that way,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 and then you do the Vibhachana Meditation.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Vibhachana Meditation is this terminology or synonym

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 as Dzogchen Meditation.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Now, Dzogchen Meditation.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 That means, now you're going to totally relax us.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 As I said in Samatha Meditation time,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 you're making forceful to stay mind.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 But this time, no force.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Force, simply you're going, we're going to relax our mind.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Mind.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Where are we going to relax our mind?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Where, how?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 We're going to relax our nature of the mind.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 We're going to relax our mind, the nature of the mind.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Nature of the mind is what?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 It's known as emptiness mind.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Those are the terminology used.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 To do this, and you sit with the right posture

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 or the semi radial posture,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 or sitting on the chair wherever you're comfortable,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 sitting, and straight up, same posture,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 and then the same posture as Samatha Meditation.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And then, look inwardly by yourself.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 By your mind, look to your mind.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 When you look to your mind, you're not what you see.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 There's nothing really to see, anything.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 That is the nature of the mind.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 And then, just relax now.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Relax on that.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Be in that status.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And that nature state is, what in the teaching said,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 is pure from the beginning, free from the complex cities.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 There's nothing, any border or any kind of like,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 any object, anything you see is free from all the complex cities.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Those complex cities, what it was called,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 existing, non-existing, permanent, non-parmanent.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 All eternal or nihilist negation.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 It's free from the negation, free from the internal,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 free from the existing, free from the non-existing.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And the existing, non-existing, eternal negation,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 those are known as complex cities.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 They are the complex cities.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 They are like, in the way, it is publications.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Your mind is free from the publications.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And that you can read yourself when you look to your mind.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 What do you find?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Point.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 There is nothing really to find.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And we look carefully.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 There is nothing to find.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And every somehow, that again, understand what that means.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Then, what in the teaching said?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Said, where mind come from?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 Where mind is come from?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 And look to the source of your mind.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 And where is mind now?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Where mind is going?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Or where?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 After you look that three ways, what answer do we have?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Where mind come from?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 What answer do we have?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 There is nothing answer, no answers.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 It's called, source is free from.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Free from the source.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Mind is free from the source.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Source.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And where is mind now?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Now.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Of course, we always believe and we have mind now.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 But where is now if we look carefully?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 There is no answers.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Where, mind, where?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 That means our past mind.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 This prison mind, where is going?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 There is no destination.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 So there is no source.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Mind is free from the source.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Mind is free from the existing in the prison.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 And mind is free from the destination.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 So what is that mind?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 That is then in the Buddha's teaching,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 named as emptiness.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 But emptiness is not the negation emptiness

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 or blank emptiness.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Emptiness is beyond the conceptions.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 This emptiness, mind emptiness, what we are talking,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 is beyond the conceptions.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Conservation cannot apply to any things,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 any analyzations that consumption or idea like to put.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 It's free from ideas, free from conceptions.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Conceptions.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 That is what is known as the nature of the mind.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 That is vipassana.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 When you see that as it is,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 that is known as in Buddhism vipassana,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 which means supreme seeing inside, inside.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 We never saw that before.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 But now you see, exactly that how the mind is.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Moreover, it is a discipline.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Discipline of the mind is same.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 We say all bad good is good.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Love, compassion is good.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Anger and jealous is bad.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 That's true.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 But when you look to the love and compassion,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 where is that again?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Speech is so good, so powerful, so spiritual.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Also, love and compassion is the same.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 It's empty or free from that whole ideas.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 And this evolution of the negative is so bad, all that.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Reality also is free from ideas.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 It's emptiness.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 There's nothing.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 So all is the same.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 It's only what is bad, the difference.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 It's our grasp.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Clinging, grasping, clinging, holding onto that.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Holding onto the idea, holding on that notion,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 again and again, that.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 But even holding itself, every look, is free.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 It's the entry.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 There's nothing substantial and solid at all.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 It's the illusion, or that's the terminology.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 There's nothing existing.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 That is you look, this is of course the greatest teaching of Buddha's teaching.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 But what the greatest is, is not just I say that you believe.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 You look your own self.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 It's true or not.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 That's true.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 When we look, it looks like true.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 What we find, what we answer.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 We have any answer than that.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Or it is looking better idea than that.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Nothing.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And by maintaining that now,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 exactly as it is, exactly the way things are,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 maintaining that state is known as meditation.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Meditation absorptions.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 And here I say, even if you see this.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Poem, dissolve to the organ space.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 That great emptiness, that openness,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 what we discover the nature of the mind,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 that is the organ of spaces.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 That is saty-ness samadhi, saty-ness.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Saty-ness, that is the saty-ness of true nature.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Samadhi means meditation, Sanskrit word, concentrate, meditate.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 So meditation of the saty-ness.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 That is organ and nature.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Relaxing on that state is known as, as I said so many times, meditate.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Now we should maintain this.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 That is the dissolving state or complete state.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 To maintain this state.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And this is the will that we carry.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 This is our original will of the true nature.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Now we are beholden as it is.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Will is, our will is beyond the consumptions.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And beyond the territories.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 Beyond the existence.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Beyond the negations.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And beyond anything to hold.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 We relax in that state.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Relax in that state.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 When we relax in that state, then again all the display will arise.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 That means the thought will come.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 This is the part of the display.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 As I said, nature of the mind is known as emptiness, it is not the blank emptiness.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 It is the fullness of all the energies.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I am using terminology as energy, but it is not a solid energy.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 It is pervasive qualities of the nature.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 From that, all these thoughts are arising.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 When this arising, that thought has already said.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I already said.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 That nature is nothing changed.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Nature of that emptiness is nothing changed.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Every our thought, every incident our thoughts are emptiness thoughts.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Every our loving kind of thought is the emptiness of loving kindness.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 And compassion is loving emptiness of compassion.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Everything is like that emptiness, that openness, that freedom.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 It is just headed as old in the nature as it is.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 The old in the nature of our mind.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.220
 Every display of our conception, even the spark in many ways and this and that, all the nature is

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.000
 the same.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 As like water, for example, waves in oceans.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 There is a lot of waves in the ocean, there is waves in the ocean, tide and all that comes.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 No matter whatever display you see, they are not different from the water or ocean.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 It is the same, it is just a movement.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 The waves and the tide, the ripples, whatever is the same thing as that ocean.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 There is no change, nothing changed.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Same way, all thoughts, all this, this, whatever comes, nothing changed.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Only what is changed, where we handle it, where we handle it.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 And where we handle it, when we grasp in the whole thing, then it becomes hard.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Solid, even it is not solid.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It becomes solid and then disturbed.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 We let it go as it comes, it starts to solve.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Disturbance, it is not disturbed, it is a display.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 That is what all those zoki monsters, zoki practice, say, liberating as it arises.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Not permanently blocking the thought, not pursuing chasing the thought, let it be.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Let it come, let it be and let it go.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Those are the instructions used to bring this realization, to ring the bell to us,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 so how we should handle it.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 If we don't let it go, then we grasp it, we cling it, then it connects with emotions.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Even beautiful loving kindness, we sometimes spoil as emotions.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Even beautiful compassion, we spoil, whereby those are our graspings.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.440
 Then anger and yellows, we already spoil, then they are dense and they are very disturbance, very

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.000
 disturbance.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Disturbance, and then it adds mass to our soul and to everyone's.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.460
 But all that starts with this prompt, emptiness mind, is the echoes or the waves of the emptiness

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.000
 display of the mind.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 See that exactly as it is and maintaining that, then be in that sense.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And meditating or being in that sense of meditation, what is known as that?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 We continue that liberative. As it arises, you liberate.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 And when we are able to do that, what is it doing?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Then you are really exploring the true trigger of the emptiness nature of the mind, true trigger.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 When you let it go as it is, you reveal the true trigger.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 What is trigger? Trigger is love. Trigger is compassion. Trigger is wisdom.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Trigger is joy and apricot.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 That is reworldly. And you become also courage and very strong, strong confidence.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 You are not caught with emotion and not covered by that grasp of emotion.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.840
 You are fully extending your ways of the true nature as it is to fly and to cover the horizons of

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.000
 the true natures, as it is.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Really it begins with that. And then discover the inner college.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.020
 All the beautiful inner colleges, infinite inner college, trillions from that, then known as,

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.000
 finally known as, become the Buddha's.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Getting enlightened or become the Buddha's.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Buddha is not just something coming from outside or become something certain thing.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Buddha is, as we say so many times, we discover the exact nature of the mind of what we hear.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.400
 Without the blockage of happy depression or these emotions, negative emotions, we discover exactly

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.000
 that nature as it is.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:20.040
 With that we discover exactly Durya Tulu as it is, whether mind of Durya Tulu, whether form of Dury

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.000
a Tulu, whether sound of Durya Tulu.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 And now we discover exactly the whether mind of the Durya Tulu as it is.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 That is known as the practicing of the Durya Tulus.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 All complete stages of the practicing. So meditate in that state as long as you have time.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.450
 In that time. So if you have time you can stay for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1/2 hour,

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.000
 whatever.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 This is Dzokhi meditation. That's exactly this.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Dzokhi meditation, that will directly connect to true nature, all inner nature, quality as it is.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:13.420
 During those times, during those meditation, occasionally the brain, again, start with, already we

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.000
 say, start with joy and appreciation and devotion and both each other.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:27.340
 But even during that meditation, just for few seconds, like 2 seconds or the half minute, there's

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.000
 just very more joy and appreciation.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.680
 Let that joy and appreciation also arise, this arises from that great implement built from that

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.000
 space, arise.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Let that arise again and let that also prevail to hold the space of the pure nature, natures.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 And then again relax, relax, continue meditating on Dzokhi as we start.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.920
 And then occasionally arises the deep power of loving kindness, compassion or body, for all really

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.000
 living beings, to every living being.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:10.880
 Just for, again, half minute or whatever, 30 seconds, whatever, great, every good thing, to every

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.000
 living being.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 That also expression of your true nature of this absolute state of mind.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.630
 And that came and let again that merge back to that source, where it comes and relax continually on

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:27.000
 that great Dzokhi status.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 And then occasionally let it come, great joy and appreciation.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.490
 Again, how beautiful, how wonderful, how precious that I met such a beautiful situation, something

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.000
 that I have and I have such beautiful teachings.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.560
 That gracious teaching of the Buddha Shakyamaji is not all for accident, truly this is, I'm

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.000
 connected to this.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 And pray of those joy and appreciation.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Again, from the deep way of your nature of the great emptiness of the mind.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.390
 And let prevail that in the deep nature step was in the space of the great primordial nature state

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.000
 of mind.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.940
 And let that also subside again back to this own net and continually maintain, meditate on being in

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.000
 that status.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Status. So those are then, okay, and then continue meditate.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:25.470
 And that is what, oh, okay, can also bring great devotions, devotions, and let that subside that

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.000
 same way as that and continue meditate.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 So that is really about this complete stage of practices.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 So after you meditated that, pause for this meditation.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Then the premier said, after that, and then from the, again, then it reappears, that is.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.490
 This is just a reminder, again reappears means it's mainly pause the meditation, pause the

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.000
 meditation or a procession is now complete of that.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 But still you should keep continually your meditation, that realization, continually.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 From here, again, from the unborn state of my own intrinsic nature.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.810
 That means that all inner space, all that satin state, satin samadhi, arise unceasing illusion

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.000
 display, arise illusion display.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 What illusion display?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Is mahanguru, Kriji, powerful? Doji, Tolu. Or Doji, Tolu, Tolu.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 And as well as entire medulla, what is all appeared, reappeared.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Exhale as it, as meditated in the time of the, of the regular form, regular song meditation.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Exhale at the appeared, exactly. It's not just appeared, they are like that. They are that space.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:58.020
 Everything is regular form, every form that we see by eye, eye is a regular form, every song system

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.000
 we hear through our ears senses is a regular song.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Song. Then every of our mind and space, as we discussed, is a regular, what's the mind?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 And these three regular states, also not from, different from each other, all in all.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 That's the nature. It's all is all. There's nothing really changed.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Any, only it is the, the highlight of the expression of the display of the true nature.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 Nature, reality level, all is in the same. Same.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 This is not three different parts or particles there.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 And they see that. And, and here was it.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Of the mahanguru, Kriji, powerful? Doji, Tolu, as, as bubble appears in the water.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And that means, all is illusion display.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Help me do what you see. All, even though they look like so solid, this wall and mold and all that.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 According to the Buddha Kriji, it's all, no, it's like illusions.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 There's nothing really substantial solid existing at all.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.310
 It's all the combination of the many particles or the many atoms, atoms, atoms come together and

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.000
 perform.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Even those atoms have so many particles.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 And so this is like hallucination bubbles of the formation of the universe.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.270
 Therefore, those great enlightened beings that can go through the mountain, can go, can go through

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.000
 the walls.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 They can walk on the water. They can walk in the sky.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 And because this is, what we see is because we are bounded and caught by the duality.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 But when you release this duality boundaries, nature is totally freedom, totally flexible.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Therefore, they can do so many things, what we call miraculous activities.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 It's not just miracle, miracle, they're doing something.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 But nature is that.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 They join the exact expression and call it where the nature is.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 That's what. We have completely become unrealistic.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 We are out of that because of our dualities.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 They are like in the central of the way that nature is.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 That's the difference. So then everything.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 So as bubble, apples and the bottles.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 And with that, and then next one is what?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 This is known as dedication and aspirate.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So now, after that, what we said, said at the beginning.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Beginning good, middle good.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 So we completed really beginning good, middle good.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 That we completed.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Now is the ending good, or the third good, the ending good.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Ending good is the dedication and aspirations.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Aspirations and the more aspiration, praise.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 So those are ending good.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 So this again, we started our practice with good motivation.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Good, beginning good.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 What is the beginning good?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Again, beginning good is job and appreciation, kindness.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Comparing your thought to all living beings.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Wishing everything best to every living being.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Not just wishing now that, but wishing that good to every best forever.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 And all the difficulty tuples are freed from ever.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 And cause of difficulty tuples are freed from forever.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 That's what we wish, and that's what we, with that attitude, we meditate in the practice.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Then we practice.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Now we come to the concluding of these practices.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Also we are going to the concluding of this practice exactly where we started.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 We started with good heart.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Good heart, good wishes.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 So we're going to do that.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 We're going to aspirations.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 We're going to good wishes.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Same job, we're going to dedicate.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Any merit, any power, any good things.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 And we got something by this merit practice.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 We're going to that distributed to all living beings without any discriminations.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 And without any judgment.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 We made this become cause to remove that suffering and difficulty tuples.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 And cause of suffering and difficulty tuples forever.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 And they become instantly wake up to the ordinary Buddha or become the Buddha.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 We wish this.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 So that's what's called aspiration and dedication.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 Dedication is one of the very, as I said two times,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 is one of the very special teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 And it's called lines rose.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 This is not any other great teachings mentioned.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 But Buddha said even the merit or energy which should share that to every living beings.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 So here, how is it?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 It's delegation as prayers.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 That is here.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Who is Sanskrit?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Sanskrit syllable and which means expression of joy.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 That means now we practice this practice with good heart.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Beginning with good heart, beginning practice with good heart.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 Middle practice with good heart and assembly.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 We did wonderful.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 That's a speech.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 Something we could rejoice.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 We could have it.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Therefore it's called hope.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 And now not just only that.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 We have something to share to every living beings.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 Please put their good and happy in peace.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 Peace therefore is like what we feel happy in the joy, what we did.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 And we are happy in the joy what we have to share to everyone.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 And what we are going to wish to others.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 That is Sanskrit word.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 It means whores.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 And here is it then on the supreme path of the boneless supreme yanas.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 So we follow the supreme path.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 That means it's the very inner teachings.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 We have given varieties of the teachings.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 But this teaching what we practice is supreme yanas.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 That means it is directly benefiting to, we are going to work to benefit all living beings.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Directly we are going to try to remove our duality and habit that hindrance of our mental state.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 So we can become as really true living Buddha's or our son become Buddha.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 So this is a supreme powerful path or the technique that we are.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 We are.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 And so therefore this boneless supreme yanas.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Because of that technique in the teaching.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Then by the practicing that indestructible primordial wisdom.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 So I practice on primordial wisdom.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Primordial wisdom is indestructible primordial wisdom is what is your our own nature of the mind.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Our own natural mind is indestructible.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 It is unchanging.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 It is primordial wisdom.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 We try.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 We practice to reveal that with blessings of the Duryatolu primordial wisdom.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 And guruvaty is primordial wisdom.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 Indestructible primordial wisdom of the body, speech, mind or the blessing Heruka of the Duryatolu

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 by their blessing.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.940
 We combine toghede in a way powerful of the blessing light of the indestructible of the body's mind

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.000
 of the Duryatolu.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:49.280
 And that light heat or going to that powerful acumen or for that technique to put to our primordial

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.000
 wisdom.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 Primordial wisdom so that we can reveal fully as it is.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Because by that that power whatever the power I share that to all living beings.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 And by that may everyone also reach the below.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 So I wish that one of my practice is married, one of God practice.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 I share that to all living beings is dedicating.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.850
 And what by that I wish everyone become enlightenment free from the suffering and the difficulty

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.000
 and trouble and reach to them.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 That state is then aspiration, please.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 And the next one is aspiration, please.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 And that is also a spiritual prayer but this is aspiration.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 And that is against it.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 And the whole Duryatolu, the embodiment also gathers.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 And then I mean you know it's already translated here so I don't want to go too much.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 And the mighty power for Heruka, destroyer of the old obstacles.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 May all the obstacles be removed and all good certain terms be actualized.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 And may everyone, acupical city and swiftly attend supreme and only accomplishment.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 And that is the acupical prayer, again it's aspirational prayer.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 And this time according to the instruction that you can visualize all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 Such as peace of Buddhas, wrath of Buddhas, similar to the Buddhas of men and female.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 And the Bodhisattva of men and females.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 And all the lineage masters, teachers, men and females.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 And then Dharmavala's men and females all came right in space as Venbo and the Duryatolu.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:48.990
 And all came and then as you prayed this and that moment they all sent their blessings in the form

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.000
 of clothes.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 And they shouted on every different direction of this world and beyond this world.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Every universe, every galaxy. It's really that completely shower, dome, the blessings of that.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.470
 So everywhere there is then become like everything is completely old, bad circumstances instantly

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.000
 removed.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 And then it also that means it removes all the like such as disturbance from the elements.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Unbalanced elements of water, the fire, wind, the earth, those are disturbance.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 The natural disasters are completely strong and that also then become completely balanced.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 The elements are completely balanced.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 That balance of all the human mentalities are all balanced.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 And there is no more wars, no more permanence, no more disease.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 And it ever came up, came and completely subsided or removed that.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 And then this universe everywhere is become like the golden egg of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.590
 Amitabha can really feel that energy in this prayer, in some of the Ashpika's prayers that you can

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.000
 do.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.130
 And so that is then concluding this practice and that is known as and then some other dedication of

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.000
 our prayers.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 And you can do those all known as ending goodness practices.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 And so that means now we completed the beginning good, middle good and concluding good.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 And that is my prim talk. I'm going to start here.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 And now we have some questions. Please, we talk.
