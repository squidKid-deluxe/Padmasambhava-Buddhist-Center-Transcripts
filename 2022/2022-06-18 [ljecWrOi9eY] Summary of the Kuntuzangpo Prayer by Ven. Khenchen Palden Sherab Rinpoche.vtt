This is the essence teaching of the Buddha, which was repeated by Guru Padmasambhava and continually carried by so many great practitioners. This practice and aspiration prayer is an esoteric teaching in the form of a prayer and aspiration. For centuries the voices of the hermitage yogis and yoginis reciting this prayer have echoed throughout the valleys and mountains of Tibet and the Himalayas.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 The score of Infinite Freedom has more details, all that you can look at.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.960
 But this is according to Hinti for the Hiramuki, Mehir here, and this is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 that the whole teaching is summarized into five groups.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.560
 And the first one is how this teaching happened, how that happened,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.360
 happened, the teaching happened.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.040
 And then this teaching kind of accelerated the joy and appreciation

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160
 by the regular mantras.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 And then, and the samsara and nirvana are the same,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.880
 but it has two results that maybe they get that realization.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.960
 And then how samsara and nirvana are begin to separate

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.200
 or taking different directions, how that happened.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.480
 And that again, reuniting, and then, and so kind

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.600
 of detailed explaining how that the division of the samsara and nirvana

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 and maybe understand what that meaning.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.480
 So each prayer, you know, wishing, with aspiration prayer,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.560
 wishing we may return back to the old days.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.400
 So prefer from the delusions or prefer from the samsaras.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.480
 So that is kind of going totally explained.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.680
 And then the end is concluding that with it,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 again with more instructions of this praise.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.760
 So those are the really summarized teaching of the entire of this, this.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.520
 And now, here, the beginning of this prayer, and that is actually,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.440
 many times the prayer, this is written in the end,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 but according to the Thema, Thema teaching of this Guru Mahārājī thing,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.240
 and this is, I think at the beginning, or maybe it's also in the end too,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 but also is in the beginning.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 And that is the Kundasam prayer, if you have that and open that.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.840
 Thus, it says, "From the center, we clearly show the unimpeded realization

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 of the Buddha Kundasambhu in the general perfection.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:35.080
 This is, oh yeah, this is the ninth chapter, I think we can say.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.400
 This is the ninth chapter,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.760
 "The prayer that will lead sentient beings to the enlightenment state

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.800
 without any choice."

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.160
 So that is, I think it's in the beginning too.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.640
 According to the Kṛṣṇa tradition, here, at the beginning time,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.800
 and that is summarized in the title of these practices,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.040
 or in the title of this prayer, and that is so.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.160
 And now, again, I do go over this.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.680
 This is the Buddha Samanabhadi prayer.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.320
 And if we do these practices, if we do these meditations,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.960
 then what is with us?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.080
 Thus, it will instantly reverse the samsara immediately

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.560
 and reach to Buddhahood, or it will lead us back

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000
 to the ordinary states without any choice.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.880
 And so that is the word. That means there is no more delusions.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.440
 No more if a delusion begins, then samsara ends right there, there.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.200
 So that means that moment will recognize

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 of this reason of all these delusions of the samsaras,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.160
 and then relaxing in the natural state of our own ordinary mind,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.120
 that moment we are really reversing samsara or reversing it.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.440
 Immediately we liberate it.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 And when we liberated that all, then what?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.440
 Then it's enlightened states, enlightened states.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.760
 So now, of course, how long we can keep this?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.680
 This is our, again, question for us, being that, again,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.040
 we have to keep these practices.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.960
 Practice again and again with mindfulness, alertness.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.640
 We have to keep continuing.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.480
 So that is, and this is a very powerful phrase.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.160
 Because why it's powerful?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.680
 Because it touches the whole of the true nature,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.920
 the whole of the source of the samsara,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.360
 and the whole of the enlightenment.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.840
 It really touches.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.560
 The division of the samsara and the nirvana

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.680
 or the enlightenment in the samsara, there's not big divisions.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 There's not big divisions.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:23.120
 Only is our grasping mind, if it's false, then it's samsara.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.160
 If don't hold and let go, then it's nirvana.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.200
 So therefore, this is so powerful phrase.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.280
 That's what he said.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.200
 And so this is.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.440
 And the next one, as we continue, we'll say it here.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 The powerful vegetables that encouraging or accelerating

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.520
 of the joy and appreciation.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.360
 And that is, is then this syllable whole in the beginning

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.160
 of this prayer.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.600
 This is whole.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.640
 So generally, whole in the samsara world,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.760
 the whole in the samsara world, whole is expression of joy,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.320
 expression of the appreciations.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.360
 But this time, why we accelerate the joy

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.400
 or the expression of the joy?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.040
 Because now we discover samsara, nirvana,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.400
 is not something part different, part distance.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.640
 It's right in our own state of the mind.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.520
 We have the perfect opportunities,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.040
 perfect cover balance to change where the samsara is

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.320
 and to be in the nirvana or to enlightenment status.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.800
 So therefore, samsara is not outside.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.600
 Samsara, nirvana is not outside.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.720
 And both are, it's only the matter of the mind, how we act.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.360
 Therefore, it is great discover, great finding.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.160
 For that reason, how wonderful, how grateful.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.480
 This is the teaching of the great teacher,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.600
 Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurupa and Masambha's teaching.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.520
 How wonderful.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.480
 We really now can discover this.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.320
 This nature, how easily and beautiful.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.320
 So that is really experience.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.200
 And now why you get all this, the joy and the appreciate?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.800
 Then explaining this here, here.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.680
 Next one is what?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.440
 Next one is the, is the, I think I won't,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.240
 maybe if I go back while they said here, can we see this?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.080
 Yeah, here, the prayer of the samsara and nirvana,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.560
 one source, trip out and to resort.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.240
 Kind of really explaining that.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.760
 So that is what it is.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.560
 Next electronic.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.700
 So that means samsara.
