Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPadma Samye Ling\nOctober 1, 2020\nwww.padmasambhava.org/psl-meadow-stupa-garden\n\n\n\nAs Buddha Shakyamuni told in the Sutra teachings, if you build a temple or stupa that represents the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, it will bring tremendous merit. Even when it is gone, the dust of this place will continue to generate merit and benefit to all those connected to this project. According to that, we dedicate this merit.\n\n\nBy this merit may all obtain omniscience.\nMay it defeat the enemy, wrong-doing.\nFrom the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nFrom the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.200
 May all beings be happy and free from suffering. May their happiness never be forgotten and may

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:32.000
 they guide in their communities. Okay, I think we'll just do one time. And I posture the offering,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.880
 and ask you to remain. When there is small amount of virtue I have to be humane, I dedicate for the

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.040
 enlightenment of all beings. And then, free from the arrows holding the lotus, a blazing sword of

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.680
 perfect wisdom, and the skull cup of a Brahma, symbolizing freedom from emotions, filled with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.720
 a variety of beautiful fragrant flowers, all others are utterly subdued. I praise the one who is

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.240
 beautified by wearing a snake as a Brahma cord.
