00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960
 Thank you so much for coming again, for participating and making time with your effort and coming

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.400
 here.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 Thank you so much everyone, all of you too, but also those who came today to study. Thank you again

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.900
 for attending so much.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:27.220
 So again, we go down to the teaching and the teaching is of course "The Greatest Kindness of Asian

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.800
 Teacher" by the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.400
 Buddha Shakyamuni gives Dzogchen teaching, not just on his regular form that what we often see on

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.300
 Thangas or the Bhutgyas,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.200
 but it does form, in the form of the asana, Buddha Samadha Bhutji.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 And that status, the Buddha gives the teachings. Where he gives that teachings?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 The colon he gave, when he transformed that status, he gave this teaching in Akanishta.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
 The Akanishta, not within you all in this status.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 And so give this, because Dzogchen teaching is the teaching of beyond dualities.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 Duality people cannot immediately digest these teachings.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 And therefore, he gives this teaching beyond duality beyond that.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 Who are the retinues to reveal audience teachings?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.840
 All those who are highly realized beings, no other same as realization you like himself, no other

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 than.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.470
 Such as, "Pipe Diana Buddha" or in the teaching or principle, display of the self-western eman

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.200
ations that he gives these teachings.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 And in that state, he gives these Dzogchen teachings, Dzogchen teachings.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 It's continually echoed in the pure land or in the Akanishtas.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 And then it came to this wall, when his time was made.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.200
 And that is also when the greatest teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Muni, that as well we see Thangas,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.690
 that he is entering Mahabharata in the runner, Muni, great sage, Bodhisattvas, and as well as Muni

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 Muni.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 Muni Muni, Akhata, all gathered him, surrounded him.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 Among that, one of the known as great Bodhisattva, Kundak.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 He rose up from his sitting, "Oh, gracious teacher, you give the causal teachings, but you didn't

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.200
 expound.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 The result, you are the teachings."

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 And Buddha said, "I gave these teachings, but it will come."

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 On the right, one time is ready, it will come in this wall.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 But I already gave, it will come in this wall.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 As he said that, then it was 28 years after the Buddha's Mahabharata in the runner,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.200
 and then all these dandaras began to come, one after another coming up.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 And those are the five excellent dandaras and so forth.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.200
 But particularly Dokki teaching around also same time, around from the areas after.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 Then, in the gracious kindness, very emanation of the Buddha,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 regular Sattva came in the human form known as Garab Dorji.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 And Garab Dorji revealed all Dokki teachings, all both of these teachings to this wall.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 So that's how this Dokki teaching came.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.200
 Again, to receive generally in the Buddha's teaching,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200
 any received teaching that we are studying, contemplating, meditating,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 always in the teaching, say the great masters,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.200
 we should have always activated three beautiful qualities.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 And those are, as always I said, joy and appreciation.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 Joy and appreciation really for renunciation of thought or for reversing,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.200
 for point that reverse our mind from the samsara.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 That is always we should have that.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.200
 And this for renunciation of thought is so important.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 Every master, every time, you can activate that.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 Because when you activate this for renunciation of thought,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 what it does, actually, really, it will make our heart softer,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.200
 more gentle, more tender, more conformed, drawn to the ground,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200
 and become more practical, more practical.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.200
 And also become more wise, wise so that we can use time so beautifully.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:08.200
 And this is like anchor, but that's what great master Yang Bunkundra said in his teaching.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 The four renal sessions, the anchor of the practices.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.200
 Anchor was A-N-C-H-O-R, right?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 Anchor. Anchor of the practices.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.200
 So when you put the boat on the water, I think you always need anchor.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.200
 I don't believe so. I don't know exactly what anchor.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 Otherwise it will be carried up and down.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.200
 But if you have that, it's strong, it's stable, it stays, it becomes more useful.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 So therefore, if we have that, this anchor of the four renal sessions,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.200
 the joy, the appreciation, that is so...

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 If that makes our lives more meaningful, practical, simple,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 and also not kind of bumping so much with the e-books all the time, up and down.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.200
 More great, more gracious, more grateful.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.200
 It's just so beautiful. That's what every energy can make.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 And I've been talking that the other day, I mean, we can't put a highlight of that point.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.200
 And I just saw really again that first one, you all know that four renal sessions,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 which is breakfast, women's body, or eight endowments in parliament.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.200
 And Samsara has a lot of challenges and difficulties,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.200
 and cause and effect are inevitable. Those are the four.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 And I told, let me kind of highlight of that four first endowments.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.200
 I talked really again, a little bit about that, a little bit, that rest.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 I couldn't finish last time kind of that.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.200
 But this is, I mean, basically they finish, but most of the kind of...

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 I mean, you all know it's not something that I'm talking about.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.200
 But it is like this eight endowments, because they add freedoms.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.200
 Definitely we all have that add freedoms.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:18.200
 And now ten luxuries, that ten luxuries, that is many times, it's lingering us.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.200
 Even though we have ten luxuries, all that 18 endowments,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 but it is always many times lingering, particularly last three or three of each five endowments.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 It's lingering.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 If it's beginning lingering, then our 18 endowments, now we don't have 18 endowments.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200
 We have maybe 17 endowments, or 16 endowments.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 And then we have maybe 15 endowments.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200
 We have 12 endowments.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 Then it's going down endowments.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 Our, what do they call this?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 Our store market is going down.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.200
 So the market is going down.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 And who has really become the loser?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200
 Look at them.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.200
 One's normal self.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200
 There's no one else, really.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200
 It hurt.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200
 But it really hurt.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.200
 We practically, like, we really think.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 So therefore, always in the teaching, mention, those masters, always mention,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.200
 always reactivate in those 18 endowments.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.200
 Every freedom we have, that is, I'm sure we have that.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.200
 But these ten luxuries, luxuries in particular, those last few,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.200
 always should kind of activate and think of that.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200
 And who have to activate?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 We have to activate our individualism.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.200
 And other Sangha members help and inspire us or support us that,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
 but reality, we have to put in action.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 And we do that.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 Then truly we are really good, great practitioners.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
 We are really making meaningful of these lives.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Truly we're making meaningful of these lives,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 not just only for ourselves, because of both each other we have.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.200
 They have then also benefitted with others.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 So therefore, these lives, always the three important things, what in the teaching said?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.200
 Three important things, always practicing all the time is the first word I said.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.200
 You're all in the application with four random sections.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.200
 And then, second is two practices.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.200
 Two practices, one in general terminology, one in the teaching said.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.200
 It's emptiness.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.200
 Emptiness that realizes you're trying to always have that as much as you can have.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200
 Emptiness, virtue, that emptiness.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200
 That means what we learn in the heart circles, even we join in that.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.200
 Poem is emptiness.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.200
 Emptiness is foam, and foam is no other than emptiness.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
 Emptiness is no other than foam. Poems are no other than emptiness.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200
 Those are four things. This is not just only foam.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:18.200
 That related to foam, and feeling, and perception,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.200
 consumption, and consciousness, all have the same status.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.200
 So that whole thing is what is called, what is known as.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:35.200
 In the teaching said, that inconceivable emptiness arises,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.200
 allows that are completely interdependent coordinate systems.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:52.200
 The interdependent coordinate systems are arising magically from the emptiness.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:11:00.200
 All through the teaching, every use of all through the teaching arises magically.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:09.200
 There's nothing structured and nothing regulated that is arising simultaneously.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:18.200
 At the same time, what is arising never lost the flavor and the nature of the emptiness.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.200
 Therefore, it's magical, magical.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.200
 So that realization, if we are trying to always, as much as we remember,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 that's really the teaching said.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
 And the third one is bodhicitta, bodhicitta.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.200
 Bodhicitta is an interdependent arising energy,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.200
 the interdependent coordination from our nature of the mind.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 Again, it magically arises.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 There's no substitute in solid existing bodhicittas

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.200
 that we can hold in tangibles, that we all know.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.200
 But arising magically, and when you say arising magically,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:12.200
 as same as others, it never lost the flavor of this organ and nature.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:19.200
 Of the tattoo, or the nature of the mind. Never lost.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.200
 That's the way things are always.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.200
 Combined with the body of bodhicitta, in the teaching said,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 always devotions, devotions.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 Devotion is not just we were trying to make someone pleased and happy with that.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 But devotion, when we have, we feel richness.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.200
 Reach, reach of the dharma, reach of the spiritual,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 reach of the teaching, reach of the lineage.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200
 We not become powerages.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.200
 And we not just become kind of wondrous, we really begin to settle.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.200
 Read the life story of those old great masters, long keepers.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 Even he has such a great knowledge, I mean, he's openly named, we all know,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200
 omniscient, but yet his devotions,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 determinations to the teacher and to the lineage,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 when you have process of practicing, that we can read.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.200
 How much?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.200
 Because you realize that he becomes known as like the second garab doki.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
 It's not just for only because he's a glutton,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:43.200
 but because what he revealed, the meaning of life, meaning of the nature.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:52.200
 Then wisdom shines, burst it, burst it from the primordial wisdom,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.200
 as interdipidly, in magically interdipidical energy systems.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 And understanding every talk he teaches, everything.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 What in the teaching he says, the garab doki revealed 64,000 doki dandras.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.200
 The long keepers understand everything.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.200
 That's how what the great master long keepers.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 Read the life story of the long keepers.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.200
 And read the life story of the great master, Malaripa.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.200
 How much his devotions,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.200
 and how much his courage and commitment and determinations,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:40.200
 and humble and simple with contents.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:50.200
 And he becomes one of the greatest rehydration beings in Buddhist history.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 This is not just because Malaripa is so epic and so skillful

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.200
 and so kind of practical things, but because of it, devotions,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 and his courage and commitment to the dharma and to the teachings.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 Teaching, and he completely has turned the mind into teaching,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.200
 said what he did, the vinvasa yamas, with the black magics.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.200
 That become the big kind of like cause to reverse,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.200
 change his mind with courage and commitment and the determinations.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.200
 And then he become such great beings to benefit.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.200
 So many beings and sing so many beautiful songs.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200
 Where they are teaching, the essence of teaching,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.200
 or Buddha teaching, really so practical to the heart.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.200
 His words are to be like, it is just a root of the Buddha teaching.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200
 So simple, so kind of beautiful and also so good.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200
 Point, point, that's how it is.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 So therefore, always in the teaching, combine, body, jatavati, devotee.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:09.200
 So these three are one, is that, again, the devouring of foreign conversations,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200
 and then talk it with, talk it with, with it.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.200
 The structuralization, the emptiness, as I said, that's it.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.200
 And then the body jatai and the devotions.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.200
 Truly we have that feeling of kind of keeping up that,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.200
 keeping that light on in our heart.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 Truly we are in the path.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.200
 Truly we are in the path.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.200
 And so that's what I did in the teaching, said.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 So I just thought, reminded that.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.200
 And now I just told it really, really.
