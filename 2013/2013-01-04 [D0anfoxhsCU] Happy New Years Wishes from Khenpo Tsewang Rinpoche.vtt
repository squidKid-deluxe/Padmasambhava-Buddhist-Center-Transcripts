00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 Devotion to the Buddha, Dhammasanga, and the Master, in their prisons, in their blessings,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.040
 we perform again the Vajrasattva. Practicing this morning with the P훮y훮 P큰y훮 or the Gymsakh,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.320
 in the afternoon we do practice then in Regakalaya. And thinking of all that is upcoming,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.760
 all this New Year will be one of the very beautiful, bright New Year's, any negative

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 videos or the residues of the past will be completely cleansed, purified, burned, and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 pacified by the power and the blessings of the Vajrasattva, in Regakalaya, in Gharapayama

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.920
 Sambo, and the Ninja Master. With those beautiful intentions told, we set forward our beautiful

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.760
 New Year, the upcoming or this current New Year, and move forward. So again, wish and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 fulfil all our beautiful bodhicata activities that inspire, and are beautiful, and benefit

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.800
 to ourselves, and that will inspire, and benefit, and be beautiful for all beings. But thinking of

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.280
 every beautiful intention taught, bring up that on the surface, and from the bottom to the surface,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.360
 and then we practice as a teaching, as we follow this beautiful instruction, which is again

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.760
 great teachings of the of course in Gharapayama Sambo, and a great Master then

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.040
 Tertung, Girmi, Dorju, all the men in Tertung, the famous Tertung, his teaching. And since he

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.360
 gave this teaching, every great those new masters practice, and as well as Kajim, they practice. So

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 that means everyone really blessed this, one after another, throughout the generations, until now.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.440
 So they were following the voice of love and a wisdom comparison, and their bright light,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 and their footsteps. So it's wonderful, it's joyous. One of the beautiful event to start

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 to our new year. So again, this strength and joy in appreciation, every reason we should

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.040
 ignite that call, let us quote. And so those all the teachings, as you know, and again I'm just

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.960
 reminding, and now we practice. And once again, happy new year, everyone. Thank you.
