00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 The speaker has always talked in three different ways in the teachings. Of course, there are many,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.350
 many ways to understand exploring, have beauty, have nature, have qualities, have activities, but

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.000
 to simplify everything and do again in the three levels.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.520
 More highly advanced level, and then kind of semi-advanced level, and more kind of a mundane or

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.000
 regular level to discover.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 Supposedly speaking about more advanced levels, more highly advanced, more highly deepest nature of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000
 the way, exactly as it is that level.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.040
 This nature, he is known as then, has summoned the baddies, Buddha summoned the baddies, mother of

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 the old Buddhas, old male Buddhas,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 female Buddhas, Buddhas of the past, present, and future, every enlightened beings, not just the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.000
 Buddhas, but also Bodhisattva, all the practicing,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 everyone because knowing their natural, as it is, according their capabilities, whatever they

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000
 capture, their realization,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.350
 accordingly, then, in the Buddha teaching, named as like past building Buddha of, sorry, past

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 building Bodhisattva, second building Bodhisattva,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 or in the past part, second part, third part, and so forth, because of her capture of her nature.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 That nature is what, this mother nature, mother absolute nature of the Buddha summoned the baddie,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.000
 all these things, is the total openness, infinite,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 free from the obscurations, free from all the consulting thought, is inconceivable nature, and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 which is also known as the great emptiness.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 Great emptiness is not just the emptiness, but great emptiness of beyond the conception, great

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.000
 wisdom is beyond the conception,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.870
 and great compassion is beyond the conception, great loving-kind is beyond the conception, that

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:14.000
 beyond, that infinite, that inexpressible nature is known as the absolute mother,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.480
 wisdom that conditions others, or is also known as the mother summoned baddies, or sometimes in the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.000
 Buddha teaching, named as mother punya paramata.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 This is designated, this nature has no, not, what's called, partialities, it's totally pervasive.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.130
 We all have this nature, everyone has this nature, but our nature is blocked by obscurations for

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.000
 the time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 We have to explore this. So her nature is, in a way, waiting us to get up the enlightenment.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.040
 Here she is waiting all the time, no matter whatever the situation, sometimes we go through life

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 after life, day after day, or the year after year,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.570
 the nature of the, the absolute nature of the mother punya paramata or the wisdom that conditions

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.000
 others never change, never tired, never bored,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 and she is waiting us to wake up to her reality, her nature. That is the absolute mother punya par

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.000
amata or wisdom that conditions others.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.430
 So her nature, that to explore, to bring that realization, and to be bored, that's nature, what

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.000
 alternate teaching said, meditate.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.820
 And that's what we meditate also in half sutta vata, in which I, at the beginning of the prayers,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.000
 inexpressible, unceasing, unbound, natural in the sky,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 by experiencing or self-reflection awareness only to behold these great mothers.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.790
 When you have the glimpse, understand over here, nature, this our nature, that which is waiting us

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.000
 to wake up to that,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.220
 we have the glimpse, understand that nature, that will shatter the emotions, that will shatter the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.000
 ego clings, that will shatter all obstacles.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 They are so powerful, so magnificent, and that is what really the absolute mother punya paramata

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 and the absolute mother was saying that conditions others.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.020
 This is this nature, as I said, is inconceivable of love, compassion, wisdom, and openness for the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.000
 emptiness.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Since it is so space, so open, so impactful, therefore her radiating energy is actively emanating,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 many different emanations.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Those emanations are actively embedded as like the semi visible level, known as sambhokaya levels.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Sambhokaya brothers, many of you know already, many of you already know sambhokayas.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Really, sambhokaya means richness of the enlightenment, call it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.450
 Reachingness of compassion, reachingness of the wisdom, reachingness of the loving kindness,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.260
 reachingness of all the skills and methods, the variety of that nature, and that luxury is totally

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.000
 surrounded.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 That is known as sambhokaya mother, Muslim definition, so on.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.500
 In that poem, again he has many different emanations, such as various yoginis, various varahees,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 and then also five dhyana buddhas.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.950
 All those are five female dhyana buddhas. All those are known as female sambhokaya buddha of the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.000
 wisdom dakinis and so on.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 So this is again active, manifestating in the richness of these all beautiful qualities.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.410
 Call it from the impar, what's called impar or inconceivable level, then reigniter of that quality

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.000
 came as a semi visible status.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.170
 Why I'm using semi visible status? Because this richness call of the sambhokaya, we cannot really

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.000
 behold it immediately.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.260
 They are like highly culpable and practicalness, highly relaxation based can be hold that and

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.000
 externally, inwardly we can experience that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.410
 We cannot experience it because we can't experience immediately in a way it's blocked by our dual

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.000
ities, our obscurations to behold that.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.110
 So therefore it's in a semi stateless and always in the teaching state where this sambhokaya is, s

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.000
ambhokaya buddhas.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.870
 Sambhokaya buddhas residing in the inconceivable pure land, all the pure land that is beyond the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.000
 conception states.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.260
 That is the place where they reside instead. It's not just their residing, purpose of their

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.000
 residing then, but they are open all the time.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.130
 It's not something they restricted, but because due to our defilement and our obscurations, we

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.000
 cannot behold it immediately.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 We cannot behold our true nature of the sambhokaya immediately.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.780
 Because of our obscurations of the duality that is kind of dense up, built up densely many lif

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.000
etimes.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So therefore, again, to reconnect with that, what have we do?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 We practice, meditate to bring the full potential bloom of that nature.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And that is then appeared in the form as sambhokaya female buddhas, as I said, five female buddhas,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 and Vaidya yoginis, and so forth.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Those emanations are known as the sambhokaya female buddhas of the Vasanandakini's audience.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.950
 Then the narmakaya of the Vasanandakini's audience today is more actively in a kind of like

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.000
 ordinary ways, in a teaching city.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.010
 Even though it's not really ordinary that we call duality, which cannot proceed easily immediately,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.000
 but they are known as the narmakayas.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.190
 What means the narmakaya in the Sanskrit world? It means emanations, emanating, emanating and

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:17.000
 engaging to as indeed for the duality beings, that they are emanated beings.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Those are known as the narmakaya buddhas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And those narmakaya buddhas, who are they?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.380
 Actually, again, it is the narmakaya buddhas of the old tars, for example, kareen tara, white tara,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.000
 and tundi wantanas.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 And all those are known as the narmakaya emanations of the Vaidya Vasanandakini's audience.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.820
 And even though, again, tara and all these tundi wantara, we can immediately perceive that because

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:53.960
 of our dualities, these kareks of the obscurations, kind of blocking that, to behold that

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.000
 realization, understanding that.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.870
 But however, they are, again, always, in a way, waiting for us to proceed to see the nature of that

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.000
.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.790
 Right. There is no, again, kind of like lack of the compassion, lack of the wisdom, lack of the

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.000
 love and kindness.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.920
 They are full of love and compassion, wisdom, and that is also, that is our potential in a way, too

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.000
.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 It's waiting us to wake up this reality, we call it this.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So that's why. And then, yeshim surya, for example, a period.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.870
 Yeshim surya is known as the rename emanations. It's a narmakaya, but from the narmakaya Buddha, he

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.000
 appeared as form of the human beings.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Again, he came in this world, about 1,200 years ago, or 8th century.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 According to his story, he came in the midst of 8th century in Tibet.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 He is a direct emanation, of course. He is the emanation of all those dharmakaya,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 darmakaya, pimal Buddha, sambhokaya, pimal Buddha, and narmakaya, pimal Buddhas.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.270
 But he appeared as human forms of the rename makayas, kayas, in the center of it, known as ishin s

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.000
urya.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.160
 And even though he is a total enlightened beings, and as he demonstrated, with courage and

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.000
 commitment and determination,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.350
 joyful effort, and such a full devotion to receive the teaching and the practice, even though he is

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.000
 already enlightened beings,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.510
 but to show us, example, to the following, to all of us, really, she put also teachings into the

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.000
 heart and the practices.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And then, she became transcendent of Ram bodhi. She can't show that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 She demonstrated that way. She reached the transcendent of Ram bodhi.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 And the teacher also said, he emanated the world positive to Tibet,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 in order to spreading, and in order to enlighten, the spreading the teachings of the Vedayana,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 and particularly the teachings of the Gaurapayama sambhokas.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.670
 Gaurapayama sambhokas, when he came to Tibet, he gave so many teachings, particularly Vedayana

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.000
 teachings,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.620
 which is then related mostly to the inner tantras, Mahayoga tantras, Anu-yoga tantras, Atayoga tant

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.000
ras.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 He gave all those, so many teachings.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.890
 But as soon as he gave the teachings, most of those teachings, he came to them immediately to ask

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.000
 her about that.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.370
 In her meditation power, in the sambhokas' letters, which is known as Dakini sign language, but it

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.000
 is sambhokas' languages.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Sambhokas' language, in a way, is sambhokas' codes.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 And then, he hidden those teachings throughout the Tibet,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 together with blessings from Gaurapayama sambhokas, throughout the Tibet, with meditation powers.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.220
 Without going to different locations, he hidden all along with the different ritual objects, and

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.000
 blessing objects, and so forth.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 He hidden all the spiritual generations.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.120
 As Gaurapayama sambhokas, he hidden those teachings, and then also they are discovered by many

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.000
 great ertums,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 one after another, from the end of the 10th century, even until now.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.250
 So many great ertums and beings who discovered those teachings, those ritual objects, those

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.000
 blessing objects,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 really discovered and distributed to benefit all beings, so many beings.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 And so that is how he did activities.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.070
 Therefore, again, in his life, what he did, he showed devotion, courage, commitment, and joy for

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.000
 effort, have both each other.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.640
 He received all the teachings from Gaurapayama sambhokas, particularly many from Gaurapayama sambh

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.000
okas.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 And he practiced that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And also, he is known as one of the nine Heartless students from Gaurapayama sambhokas.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 He received the first time teaching with other groups of the students,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 and all of them become known as nine Heartless students, and he is one of them.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And he is particularly the master of the Vedic Rayas.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 He practiced Vedic Rayas as he received that teaching that had come and connected.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 He practiced, he meditated, and he became as the state of Vedic life.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.340
 And that particular practice of Vedic life is in southern Vedic, or in the eastern in, sorry,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.000
 eastern Bhutan,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 known as the lion's nest, or the lion's castle.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Castle, monkana, and sundae.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 He is very famous Vedic.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 He practiced meditation and actuality in Vedic life state as well.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And then, together with that, he was practiced, and as he said before,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 finally he became totally enlightened, or the transcendental historian of all this.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 He stayed in Tibet according to the story.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Muruganma sambhokas said about 55 years in Tibet, and then he left.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 But he stayed over 200 years, some say, if not, definitely over 100 years that he stayed.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Sometimes 200 years, they counted as, like, a waxing moon, and a wading moon, as well, two months.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So then it became kind of 100 years, become 200, one month, become two months, in a way.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 They kind of do that system in India, and actually in Chintang, maybe in Tibet it does,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 but India still, I think they do in villages, rural areas, they do that.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 So that system, and he stayed over in the teaching state, over 200 years.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Over 200 years, and after that, he kind of left, flew away in the sky,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 went to the teaching state of the glory mountain, and he is still living Buddha,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 along with the Gurupa and Masambhokas.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 And all those are great thetans.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 One after another, every time, this is called Padan Gurupa and Masambhokas,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 mother Yishimshoyas, because every thetans, when you read the life story of those thetans,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 they all receive so many instructions, blessings from Yishimshoyas.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Again and again, again and again, she comes on a dream, she came on a vision,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 she comes on the reality level, on the, like, in the deep, broad daylight,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 and so many of those great thetans have the life story they read in that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 In many ways, so she is a very active mother.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 She never, she is beyond death and birth.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 In that sense, she is the transcendental Masambhokas.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 So that is the mother Masambhokas Yishimshoyas.
