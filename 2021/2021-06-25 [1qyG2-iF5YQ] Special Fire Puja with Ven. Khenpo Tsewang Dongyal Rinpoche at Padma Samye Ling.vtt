 "Glorifying, the day of glorifying all the worldly deities, all the worldly invisible beings,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.430
 really glorifying deities, and in Tibetan they call them zamli chasim, so it means there is a big

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 purification there for the whole world, and then I heard what that means.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.240
 This is the first time Guru Padmasambha performed the big purification of fire puja in Tibet to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:46.290
 glorify all the worldly deities once everyone is under his command, or they took oath, and they

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.880
 took bodhijata vows, rafuja vows to protect dharma,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:59.590
 and then they were a big celebration of glorifying with fire puja, so today is that day. I heard

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.880
 this full moon, so that today is a very special day, and that's what I really thought we'd do today

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.880
.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.620
 So this is my video. Since we didn't do this here, this year at least, and then it's so beautiful

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.710
 here with stupa, really nice, really beautiful. Thank you Thapam. Wonderful. It's very cold, but I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.880
 feel okay.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:42.790
 No, no. There's so many, right? Wow. Just a moment. Okay, thank you. Yeah, we get down and do again

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.880
. Very good. Okay, this is our, what's called, rising up the wind, wind hole.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 Okay.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:48.880 --> 00:03:16.880
