00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 In whether it is the quality of the face of the Buddha, or speaking about the wrath of the Buddha,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:17.650
 we need three principal qualities, above the three, or together with these three samadhisas, which

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.600
 we just discussed before.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:31.130
 And these three qualities of the Buddha, all 10 in the teaching said, samadhisas, samadhi in Tibet,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.300
 samadhabha, and temba.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:51.000
 Samadhasalwa samadha, dhabha, d-a-g-p-a, dhabha, and temba, t-a-n-p-a, temba.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:05.440
 Samadha is very, very important, every king. And this samadhi means clarity, clarity. And dhabha

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.800
 means purity.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 Dhabha means stable, stabilizing, or firmness, firmness.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.300
 And these three are important. Samadha means clarity of a very detailed visualization.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:36.210
 The detail of every characteristic of the visualization depends on our concentrations, shamadha,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300
 and Vibhachan meditations.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:48.030
 And so that is, again, very difficult. So among these three, one thing they said, dhabha and temba

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.300
 are the most important.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.690
 Even is not so common, even is not common so today. And that's the skill, okay? Because when your

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.300
 mind is gone up today,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.170
 if you feel that without a doubt or hesitation, even is not so clear, clear everything, that's fine

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.300
, as much as you try.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:17.610
 But then, and it's okay. And the whole samadhi's case, rather this phyto has one hundred buddha at

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.800
 least, even could be more clear.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:28.610
 One hundred buddha, it's very difficult to see everything so clear. Even one buddha, many times, we

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.800
 struggle, or clarity of the meditation.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.430
 So if one buddha, and we can claim, for example, buddha samadhi vadhara, or the buddha vajasattva,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.300
 and we can claim visualization,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.960
 the rest is not common so clear. It's okay. In the teaching said, when your mind, for example, came

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.300
, when your mind bursted,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 all entourage is there. You just focus to the first step. Then even if you didn't have time to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.800
 focus all the entourage,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.680
 secretary of state, secretary of trade, secretary of this and that, if you just focus with the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.300
 first step, then I think you're not quite okay.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.130
 Similarly here, whatever the prosperity, have you focused clearly on that? Even it's not coming so

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.300
 clear, that is still okay.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:32.170
 Even that prosperity is not coming so clear, still okay, and you have the dapa and the dhama in the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.800
 teaching said.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:46.140
 Dapa means purity. Purity is, as we simplify the propriety, I say many times, which is, the deities

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.300
 are not regular.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.390
 Buddha is not regular. Buddha is true of compassion and wisdom and transcendental wisdom and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.300
 support.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.800
 That is the religion that it is. And we have that thought, that realization, that meditation.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.320
 Then it is purity, status. Then of course all the hand implements, the gestures, the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.800
 characteristics, everything has different things.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.660
 It's not just regular things, regular hand opting, regular custom, regular this and that. It's all

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.300
 display of that, that God of love,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.080
 for both each other, compassion and wisdom, that obeying this different form, different God,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.800
 implements different customs.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:44.240
 So every kind of breath, essence, it is transcendental, wisdom, love and compassion, and we have

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.800
 that thought, then purity is quite good.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 Purity is quite good. The second, the third one, in this case third one, is dhimba.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 Dhimba is, as we discussed earlier too, is fearlessness, no hesitation, no doubt.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.510
 Where you were in meditation and regularization, we shouldn't think of this, might, that, why, what

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.800
, this and that.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.990
 We are not thinking that, then it is, we are tempted, we are not able to fully embrace the teaching

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.300
, it's self practice, self.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.910
 Our ground is shaking, already. Our clarity is already shaking, purity is already, you can't

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.300
 imagine, shaking.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:41.670
 Now, there is confidence, fearlessness is shaking, then our meditation becomes, the regularization

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.800
 becomes very shaky.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 So therefore, it's fearlessness, which also applies to confidence.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.870
 Confidence on your meditation, practice. During that time, you spend five minutes or ten minutes,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.800
 whatever you spend your time, totally dedicated to that.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.780
 If you don't spend the time to hovering with many thought of the intellectual or doubt and this and

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.800
 that, then we have to completely spoil our meditation practice.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 So these three are really important.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.000
 If we have that three, then we became, all that three is excellent, but somehow we couldn't due to

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.020
 our capability of the concentration, then this unity in the stabilized, stable, stable for the fear

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.800
lessness and confidence, this is always in the teachings, so important.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 Otherwise, it becomes very shaky.
