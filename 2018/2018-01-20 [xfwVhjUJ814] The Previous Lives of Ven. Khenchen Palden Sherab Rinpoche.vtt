00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 "Anything that I heard, myself, he is this and this and that things. But in life story, that he

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.000
 wrote,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.630
 "Apravad, Aprah, he entered Mahabharata, I tried to read, he is not occupied, but he still needs to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.000
 walk."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:38.400
 He said that when he was around maybe a few months after a few months, he was born and he was so

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.000
 sick.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.530
 Baby was so sick and my parents and then our grandparents were very much worried, worried he was

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.000
 going to die.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 And particularly the grandfather, the mother's father, our grandfather was really worried about the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 baby that he was going to die.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.800
 So at that time, very renowned Lama, who comes to our area from the north, maybe two or three days

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 journey,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.260
 by horse he comes and in our area he is considering the region of the group and mass of sword,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.000
 everyone's sword devoted.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 His name is Sabra. So then, our grandparents, family invited him to their house and asked to bless

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 the baby. So they worried, they said, "We worried, he is maybe going to die, he is so sick."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So this Lama held up, picked up the baby and hold in his hand for a few minutes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And then he handed it back, back to the grandfather, the mother's side father's grandfather.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 He said, "This old makwa cannot die easily. This grandfather will kill them."

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And he said, "What that means, great master." He said, "What that means?" He said, "He can be re-

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.000
examination or emanation of the nukin."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So this great master said to grandfather, "Father." So that is really our soul in his books.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And then, also in the continent, when he was 83 or 4 years old, he always felt he was protected by

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 big, big, long hair makwa.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 Makwa, backside, he really felt, he said that he always felt one makwa's long hair standing back

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.000
side of him.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.220
 And he feels always he had that. So that is really what the mukwa continued to say on his

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 autobiography.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 But otherwise, I never really heard anything he's saying, any of those things.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And then some other Lamaks said, "Oh, he can be decent," that thing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Some people said, "But you don't really pay too much attention on those things."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Generally, he was still dead.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.450
 And then, two years ago, we were searching the reincarnation of the hand, and then this great

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.000
 teacher in a perform.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Now, to me, many of you know that he came to it by Masang.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.950
 And he mentioned, because when he was searching, he was looking for the dreams and the divinations

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.000
 and all that.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 So when he found this baby, and just around that time, so many dreams came.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And that looks like the indicating of the previous emanations of the Kichir Rinpoche.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So many emanations.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And then he said, in India, he was a great master of Lalita. Lalita, great master of Lalita.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 That was the Napatami Rinpoche. He was in the Indian Indian time, a great master of Lalipas.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 In Tibet, he was a great master of the Parthi Ishii.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.950
 Parthi Ishii was also one of the teachers of the Napti Sanghi Ishii. Sanghi is very famous, famous

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.000
 Parthi Ishii.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:49.330
 And then in Keshasi, Keshasi is coming, he is a Guru Jamsi, one of the Kesamists and owners of Guru

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.000
 Jamsi.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 So those are these great Nampatami Rinpoche, really recognized and he announced it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 So that's it. Those I know.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.580
