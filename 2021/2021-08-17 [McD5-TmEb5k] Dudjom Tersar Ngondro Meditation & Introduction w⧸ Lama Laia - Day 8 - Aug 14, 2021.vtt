00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.600
 The essence of Dharma is compassion and wisdom, completely in union, and so just like every

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.200
 time we begin any study, any contemplation, any practice, we're really starting right

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.600
 on the ground, right from the beginning, the Buddha is pointing out the nature, and so therefore

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.360
 that's why in our practice we're always beginning, in one voice, all our great kind teachers are

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:53.080
 reminding us, just start where we are, right from the beginning, so we're always creating

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.720
 these three frames. We're all, in our essence, good from the beginning, and so then, kind

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.880
 of setting up the frame of our time to touch home base with our practice, we'll start good

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.560
 from the beginning. So that means we're connecting with our good motivation, or really connecting

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 with our heart-of-heart intention, reminding of ourselves of how things are. That's really

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 the essence of the Buddhist teachings. And so we'll just begin, just everyone reflecting

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.720
 a little bit, because it's so profound, on kind of our joy and our appreciation, just

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 how precious and special our opportunity is within the vast endless realm of possibilities.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:10.240
 Here we are, and we go on to the four thoughts, but just, you know, so just really connecting

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.320
 with how precious the opportunity is to have a moment to reflect, and the interest to reflect

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.560
 on our true nature, and with very reliable teachings and living guides to help us realize

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:34.360
 our own nature and explore that, and find our own certainty, wisdom with that. And then

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.520
 of course expanding our bodhicitta, our thought of just expanding our minds and hearts, that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.880
 all of our actions can be of great benefit, especially this moment, and the next moment,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 and the moment after that, can just ever expand in our realization of the true nature, which

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:06.200
 is nothing but wisdom, love, compassion. The mind of enlightenment is literally what bodhicitta

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.920
 means. It's the heart essence of all the Buddhist teachings. It is what's called our inherent

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:21.040
 nature itself, limitless wisdom, love, compassion. And so then, on the relative level, just

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.800
 expanding

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.560
 our minds and hearts, really setting that intention that this time we have to reflect a little

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 bit on the profound ocean of Dharma, and begin to practice. It can truly be a benefit for

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.560
 ourselves and others. Like the beautiful prayer in our, even in this book goes, you know,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.120
 bless my mind to turn toward the Dharma, bless my Dharma practice to follow the path, bless

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.640
 my path to be free of delusion. Bless me that all delusions be transformed into wisdom,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.120
 and then even more so, by realizing true nature. May we mature our own minds, and then through

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.960
 compassion and love, may we help mature the minds of others and support each other. And

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.960
 then through the blessings of the three jewels, you know, may all of our contacts and relations

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.600
 be meaningful and beneficial, and come to be through the great truth and genuine nature

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.160
 of the great support we have in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the inherent purity,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.680
 which is this third motivation of just really connecting with our devotion, with our awe

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.800
 and our reverence, our closeness feeling to the true nature of things, to the beautiful

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.440
 minds and hearts of our teachers, and friends, and masters, the ultimate nature of everything.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.800
 So these are the three motivations, you know, joy, devotion, contentment, less grasping,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.920
 a mind and heart full of love and compassion that's impartial for every single living being

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:25.120
 without exception. And just joy and closeness feeling, irreverence and trust and the deep

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:36.160
 essential goodness of things is called devotion or pure vision. That's where we always begin

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 our practice, our study, our contemplation with, and that's the essence of what we're

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.480
 practicing. That's the essence of the three vehicles, of the foundational vehicle of the

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.240
 Buddha's teachings and practice, of the Mahayana, of this bodhicitta, of the Vajrayana, the purity

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.320
 vision and devotion, all inseparably joined, working together. And that's the whole of

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.240
 the path, that's the whole of the Buddha's teachings and practices. So we're starting

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.720
 right from the heart, right from the start with these things and trying to maintain that

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.760
 atmosphere as we go and everything lands with that. And we have these beautiful practices,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:27.160
 the nundro practices, which again, we all know, but reflecting nundro means going before,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.680
 which means the foundations, the essence. And so these nundro practices are just such

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:42.280
 a beautiful place for this whole vast ocean of the Buddhist teachings to kind of land

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:52.640
 in our limited time, within our limited awareness at the moment, to begin to explore the teachings.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:00.800
 And we'll just take a couple moments to just kind of reflect in our own ways and hearts

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.480
 that's why we're here, to do this together. And we've all heard and read many different

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.720
 teachings to some degree. And now there's some people who are maybe newer, but it doesn't

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:43.440
 matter if we're all just do our best. So we'll just take a moment to reflect on those things.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:08:08.480
 And so we've been doing this for a little while. And I thought maybe today, just to

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.680
 begin to look a little bit towards one of the essential practices in nundro, which is called

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:31.980
 taking refuge. And so, again and again, we can reflect on our situation. And I find it

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:39.800
 just really helpful, just like the nundro practices are embodying all of the Buddhist

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:48.760
 teachings and practices based on these motivations, you know, renunciation, joy, appreciation,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:57.400
 bodhicitta, love, compassion, devotion, coming all together as one practice. Those who've

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:06.320
 realized that, that's the great perfection is the whole of all the Buddhist teachings.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.680
 And we're so fortunate that in our practice lineage, this stainless chain of practitioners

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.360
 has come to us in our lives and brought us this whole thing, Buddhahood, like they say,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:29.720
 in the palm of our hand, in the heart of our hearts. And then we're not ignoring anything

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:41.600
 in our practice. We're using relative truth and to explore absolute truth, just like wisdom,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.920
 compassion, purify our vision, see things more and more clearly. And that's why we have

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:57.160
 these practices. So within the nundro, we have the outer nundro, or more common, which

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:04.720
 is, again, everything comes down to the Buddha with our nundro practices, who's always there

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:12.360
 is a Guru Padma Sambhava, embodiment of all the Buddhists of the three times is the Buddha

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:23.400
 is the Dharma is the Sangha, all embodied in Guru Padma Sambhava, all of them.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.620
 And just like we say in our lineage prayers, you know, the one who shows clearly the Dharma

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:44.160
 makaya of my own mind, the true nature of my own mind, let's say like Rinpoche say, is

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:52.920
 our true nature is one who's realized that the word Buddha itself means fully awakened,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:02.560
 fully developed, what is fully developed, the mind of enlightenment, limitless wisdom, limitless

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:12.480
 love, limitless compassion. And that shines forth as the Dharma, the teachings and realizations

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.240
 that occur through that compassion. And then everything in our experience, those who follow

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:25.060
 those teachings on the outer level, as well as our whole experience is the Sangha, those

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:34.600
 who are on the path of realizing our true nature, of becoming more aware, purifying.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:45.720
 So in the Buddhist teachings, we all have Buddha nature, we all have inherently natural

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:53.440
 qualities of wisdom, love, compassion. It's just to what degree we actually really recognize

00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:06.960
 that. Like they say in this very famous Tantra of Samantabhadra Buddha, the primordial Buddha,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.120
 the source is always there, the nature of mind is always there. But there's two ways

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:22.060
 we can go. There's recognizing nature exactly as it is without any obscurations. That's

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:36.000
 called Buddhahood. And not recognizing that, which is called ignorance in different degrees.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:48.280
 It's called ordinary sentient being like myself. It's called samsara, not knowing, the miracle

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:56.280
 of not knowing, samsara, the miracle of knowing the true nature, nirvana. Their essence is

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:22.160
 the same, is the teaching. And it's up to us to explore what that truly means.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:32.880
 Every single Buddha that exists in Bodhisattva had a teacher, had that expressive quality

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:42.080
 of the true nature appearing and meeting their own mind and heart to awaken and remove our

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:54.480
 obscurations to how things are. With our basic ignorance or not knowing how things are, we

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:03.120
 tend to think, of course, that we are permanent, that we don't really see or ignore how things

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:18.000
 are connected. By simply not knowing how things are, we just create this great experience,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.960
 and we are the fortunate ones. But like the Buddha taught from the very beginning, in

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.800
 the Four Noble Truths, which relates to these things, again, the miracle of not knowing,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:41.240
 samsara is also called suffering, it's challenge, it's kind of discontent, we're discontent,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:49.320
 we're uncomfortable in different degrees. But I think that's because we have a sense

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:57.640
 of our true, of what's really underneath there somewhere, because that's our own nature.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:05.840
 So there's the truth of suffering, the first noble truth of the Buddha. But again, suffering

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:19.400
 isn't just itself, samsara is a state of mind. There's causes for samsara, the cause is ignorance

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:31.120
 and grasping, and then because everything is connected, the wish-fulfilling jewel of mind

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:50.960
 presents itself. So by misunderstanding how things are and acting out of hope and fear,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:59.080
 we create samsara. And samsara, like the Buddha's always saying, happens within our own mind.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:08.400
 It's not so much an outer circumstance, it's a state of mind, it's the deep down teaching.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:16.480
 But then the Buddha taught more than that, that deeper, there's freedom from suffering,

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:24.600
 and that freedom is not something outside either. That freedom is our very nature, again,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:31.960
 free of obscurations. So there's freedom from suffering, and there's causes for that. There's

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:38.640
 ways in which we can liberate ourselves from our misunderstanding through study, through

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.760
 contemplation, through practice of these beautiful teachings that the great kind ones have given

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:55.800
 us. [pause]

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:23.800
 And then we really just explore that, and we realize how things are connected, that our

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:30.760
 actions do have results, even the little bits we can see, even just our attitude and how

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.800
 it affects others in just one day, not to mention to whatever degree we can see within

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:45.480
 this life, the effects of our outlook and actions done on our outlook. Like, you know,

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.400
 great Shanti Deva said, all the suffering existing in our lives and others is based

00:17:51.400 --> 00:18:01.080
 on selfishness. All the happiness of ourselves and others comes from thinking of others.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:08.120
 [pause]

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.040
 And when we begin to look at how things are connected, to some degree, look at the teachings

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:26.280
 on interdependence, how everything is magically this net of connections. And when we are looking

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.320
 at our frame of mind, we can look at just the inevitability of our actions. That's called

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:42.400
 karma. The karma of not knowing and actions done in different degrees of ignorance is

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:51.720
 samsara and eventually less and less and less obscurations and more and more and more just

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:59.080
 seeing things clearly as they are, free of kind of the limits of our conception but in

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:08.280
 our direct perception, that's ascending on the path. So seeing how things are connected,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:17.120
 how our karma, how our actions inevitably have their results and how things are always changing

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.240
 in permanence, reflecting on that and how precious within all of the possibilities,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.920
 like we said in the beginning, that we have this life, that we have these teachings, that

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:38.880
 we have the ability to explore them and not only read them, hear them, but begin to see

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:46.480
 if they are helpful for us in our own minds and hearts. These are called the four thoughts

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:54.960
 that turn the mind, the preciousness of our existence, how fleeting, everything is always

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:09.320
 moving, everything is always changing in permanence, everything is connected and moving and not

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:16.320
 understanding how things are is samsara and our samsara is our samsara. It all comes from

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.400
 our own mind and we are purifying. Those who have purified their minds are well on the

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:31.520
 way, are the noble sangha, are the buddhas, are the great bodhisattvas, are our great

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:41.820
 kind teachers appearing to us in our lives. So kind of reflecting on these four thoughts

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.400
 is so vital and important, said, when every session begins and we say again and again

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:56.540
 and again, but really contemplating them in our days, really taking them to heart because

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:02.900
 those are really essential, like Rinpoche said, it kind of helps reflecting on them, means

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:13.360
 we're really reflecting on how things are, we're not so disappointed in things because

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:20.480
 we're actually recognizing how things are. This is precious, we have our challenges but

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.720
 we have precious life, precious opportunity and it won't be with us forever, like they

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:34.640
 say make hay while the sun shines. This is a beautiful moment, a beautiful life, really

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:41.760
 make meaning of it and all of our actions do have results. So really checking our mind

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.280
 and our motivation, really keeping our mindfulness and our alertness and seeing how much our

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:55.000
 state of mind and our actions are really connected to what we truly value and love and embrace

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:09.280
 and support. So vital, beautiful, and really just remembering samsara. Samsara is not it,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:17.220
 there's deeper, it gets better, is what the Buddhas and bodhisattvas are showing us. And

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:27.840
 so that is turning our mind toward the Dharma, turning our mind towards the Buddha, turning

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:37.920
 our minds toward the Dharma, turning our minds towards the Sangha and seeing their value,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:44.400
 letting them inspire us to explore our reality. Again to refrain, become more and more aware

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:55.920
 of what's causing ourselves and others trouble and refraining as we need to and can and more

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:04.560
 important seeing what really brings our benefit and balance and strength and brings out our

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:11.620
 just natural goodness qualities and lightness of heart and mind and kindness and good habits

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:17.980
 that help support things, engaging in beneficial activities, meaningful activities in line

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:27.280
 with our true intentions and always remembering the really important thing. It's all happening

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:35.260
 in our mind, taming our mind, becoming more and more familiar with the nature of our mind.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:43.240
 That's the path of meditation and that's what we're doing with these practices. Turning our

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:56.040
 mind towards the Three Jewels who are embodied as the Lama, the mind of realization in our

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:01.320
 precious teachers in this life and like his whole and his dudrim and bhishay, Guru Padma

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:11.160
 Sambhava, Buddha Shakyamuni, Tara, Yeshay Sojal, their realization. That's what we're really

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:19.720
 having a draw to. So we don't have a whole lot more time to go but the essence of taking

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:26.400
 refuge is like the reason I went over all the four thoughts is because they're so vital

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:36.880
 but also the essence of taking refuge right is we're moving towards something that's reliable.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:47.080
 We're taking refuge and we're embracing and embodying and exploring what's reliable. We're

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:55.320
 moving away from what's unreliable. Our unreliable, unrealistic, impractical assumptions about

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:03.820
 who we are and what's happening. We're moving away from that towards what's more reliable,

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:21.280
 what's more tried by time as truth. So there's basic ways we can do that and maybe it's getting

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:27.480
 towards time to just start our practice. So I'm hoping and then we have all these times

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:36.680
 so I hope this is helpful. But refuge, moving towards what's reliable. As much as we can

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:43.920
 explore just how things are deep, deep on the outer level and kind of reverse our assumptions,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:58.620
 the things are great. Refrain from harm, engage in good, tame our own mind, work with our own

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:08.680
 mind and look towards these great role models we have as the Buddha and the teachings and

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:18.320
 expressions of compassion that they give us and support each other as a sangha. That's

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:25.280
 it until we ourselves can become an object of refuge. So maybe next week we can go a little

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:33.680
 bit more into just reflecting on what is the Buddha? What is a Buddha? What are the qualities

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:41.770
 of a Buddha? What is the Dharma? What are different ways of framing? What is the Dharma, the

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:42.160
 teachings

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.760
 of the Buddha? And what is the sangha? There's so many levels and layers and we don't have

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.600
 to wait till next week to do it. Hopefully to whatever degree we've heard these teachings

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.300
 and contemplated that as we go through the practice. We're giving a place for that atmosphere

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:07.520
 to land and settle and for our mind to be with that and just create those beautiful ripples

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.620
 of accumulating our merit and our wisdom, our positive karma towards realization, ushering

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:20.960
 our minds through conception, ushering our minds beyond conception to the true nature,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:30.320
 uniting skillful means and wisdom, love and compassion. It's a lot of words but we've

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:37.560
 all heard some degree of the teachings and it's nice if we can practice them together.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:43.560
 So we'll begin I think little by little just reflecting more on the different phases of

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:49.840
 the nundra practice and can reflect on that according to our time and our capacities.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.160
 But we really have about an hour now to move through the practices so we'll do that and

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.400
 again as we're chanting just reflect on the meaning. Whatever the meaning is for us at

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:10.200
 this moment and relax our mind and we'll always come back to just letting go. Again that's

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.740
 the essence of becoming familiar, the path of meditation. Buddha gave us two main frames

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:24.780
 for that called shamatha and vipassana, calm, abiding, developing our concentration and

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:31.320
 then with that as a good base what's truly liberative is seeing things as they are or

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:44.000
 supreme seeing, insight, direct perception into the nature of things and how they appear.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.240
 So that's what we're doing with our practice. That's the path of meditation. So we're always

00:28:53.240 --> 00:29:03.760
 going to the essence of shamatha is holding a focus of being within the container. The

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:11.520
 essence of vipassana is opening, releasing, letting go. And so we'll just be with that

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.720
 breath as we're practicing.
