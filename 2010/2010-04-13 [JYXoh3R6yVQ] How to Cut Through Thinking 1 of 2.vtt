00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:25.710
 I think it's called zongzi. There's two. I think it's true. And so this is called ego-klingi, or

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:39.440
 duality. And first, in that way, in that context, ego-klingi, what is, again, is duality, and that

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.000
 ego we cut.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:57.600
 Then in zongzi, this is called zongzi, or duality, or duality. And then there's another ego-klingi

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.000
 in the teaching, said, as you know, the grasping to the object, object or the object that you cut.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:16.090
 So, this is both grasping and duality. So, in one way or another, we talk about duality. Grasping

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:29.000
 to the subject, grasping to the object, both are grasping and that duality, and that has to be cut.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.870
 And so that is the way, it's not outside, but its own mind. So, now we cut that mental state, cut

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.000
 that duality in the space of the mind.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.670
 And the thing, as a way to cut that, is that the most simple one, or the most government teaching,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:02.430
 said, don't follow that thought. Not following that thought is also one way of cutting that,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.000
 cutting thought.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.940
 The moment you not follow thought, then the teaching adds another one, look to the source of that

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:19.500
 thought. When you do look to the source of that thought, that moment, the fabrication or the

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:28.000
 complexity of the thought, grasping, is really instantly evaporated or free.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.730
 And you reach to the point of the natural itself, like that moment. And that is the essence of the

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:45.000
 natural or the heart of the tattoo status. And then we just say, relax in that state.
