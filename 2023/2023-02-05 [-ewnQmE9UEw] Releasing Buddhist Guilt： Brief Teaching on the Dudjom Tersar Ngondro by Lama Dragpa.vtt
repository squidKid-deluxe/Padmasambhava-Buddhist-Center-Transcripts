NOTE     "synopsis": "Brief Teaching on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nby Lama Pema Dragpa\n\nFebruary 4, 2023\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n--\n\nHomage to the supreme medicine of the Dharma which heals all wounds without any side effects!\n\nHow can we avoid the detour of feeling bad about our practice or seeing it as a burden?\n\nHow can we walk a path of peace peacefully instead of seeing it as one more thing to check off our list?\n\nHow can we allow ourselves to mingle with the Dharma so courageously, tenderly, kindly, and clearly that challenges become medicine, negativities become avenues for growth, and the richness of life can be enjoyed and celebrated rather than be dampened by a heaviness that holds on too tightly?\n\nIn other words, how can we use compassion wisely so that our inherent dignity shines more brightly for the benefit of all beings, and rather than having to make ourselves \u201cgood,\u201d we simply allow our nature to be as it is: naturally good?\n\n--\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\n\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha. They are a perfect and complete framework for cultivating a balanced, effective, and rewarding spiritual practice.We\u2019ll also get to practice the entire Ngondro every session!\n\nLearn More:\n\nIn \"Illuminating the Path,\" Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche give clear and profound explanations on how to practice the path of Ngondro \u2013 the foundational set of practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book includes line-by-line commentary on the concise Dudjom Tersar Ngondro revealed by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, detailed instructions on how to practice, and helpful visual illustrations. It is both deep and accessible pointing out how we can see our fundamentally enlightened nature.\n\n---\n\nLama Pema Dragpa has been a resident Dharma teacher at Padma Samye Ling since 2004. PSL is the main monastery & retreat center of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center founded by the Nyingma Dzogchen masters Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche & Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche. Ordained as a lama by Rinpoches, Dragpa graduated with honors in philosophy & religious studies from NYU in 2002, and is a senior editor of over 25 books on Buddhist philosophy & meditation.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.360
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you. Here we are again. Great fortune. Lovely opportunity

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.440
 to be together. Thanks so much for joining in. And thank you all for joining in. I thank

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
 myself for joining in. It's really good. This is good. We've come here to celebrate the dharma,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.600
 to activate the dharma in our own minds and hearts right now. So we put this time aside

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.360
 to kind of let that preciousness sizzle and open up and kind of inform all of our experience,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.800
 this kind of lived present moment. So as we always do, we kind of really reactivate that.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.160
 This connection to dharma and the connection to our own goodness, the goodness of others,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.200
 in these three ways we reactivate that. With renunciation, or joy and appreciation. And

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 then secondly, with bodhicitta. And thirdly, with pure perception. And so the first, we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.920
 kind of really turn on our gratitude and just kind of relax in one way. Just we are wonderful.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.280
 We have this goodness to just kind of be with that. Let that goodness just kind of be there

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.040
 and just relax and settle. Take a deep breath and just kind of get to enjoy the being in

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 the presence of your goodness. Let it just kind of come on, turn on, and like really

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.760
 kind of shine out and appreciate all these amazing, fortunate circumstances we have.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.880
 So kind of activate this joy and appreciation and connect to that goodness inside. And then

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.960
 secondly, with bodhicitta, we're connecting to the goodness and others too. That they're

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.600
 so precious that all these beings have been our parents. We're like our only children.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.240
 So many times in so many varieties of situations. And even if we don't believe that, that these

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 beings, they don't want to suffer and they want to be happy. All of them, every single

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.480
 being we come across, all the days and years go by. Every single person or being or animal

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.240
 we've ever come across, that's all they want is to be happy. Just like me. Just like each

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.280
 of us. And so we're doing this practice so that this can be a genuine benefit for others.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.960
 That we can wake up and connect to our inherent goodness and have that shine out and just

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.680
 encourage and uplift and support and nourish all beings we come in contact with until they're

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.280
 totally free, until their goodness shines on forever. So this bodhicitta, they turn

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.920
 this on. And then the pure perception or our Vajra nature, Vajra pride, kind of seeing

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 that goodness in ourselves and in others and in one way kind of relaxing. Also our sense

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.880
 doors a little bit, not so tight, not so boxed in and kind of really to let it kind of let

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.440
 that awareness, that kindness, that creative kind of distilled intelligence to let it kind

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.480
 of really blaze and shine out. This isn't so much as a some kind of a horror show or

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.120
 some wheel of suffering we have to escape, but more like this is something to really

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.400
 enjoy and savor. This experience we have right now, this moment, like the colors we're seeing,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 the sounds we're hearing, that if we like pause and kind of allow it to be a recognition

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 of like, wow, how amazing this is. These colors and sounds, these tastes and memories, these

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 emotions, like just the richness of it all. So in a very kind of like we could say in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.240
 a really kind of approachable way, just that richness of life and my own direct experience

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.320
 right now. I could in some way be like this pure perception. So we'll kind of turn on

00:03:41.320 --> 00:04:06.880
 these three qualities in our own experience right now.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:33.560
 Wonderful. Thank you. So the topic today is called Releasing Buddhist Guilt, Releasing

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.180
 Buddhist Guilt. And so that's kind of more just like a, you know, a title, a way to kind

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.160
 of designate what we're looking at. And this comes up in response to kind of different

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.200
 questions we've gotten from Nundro in terms of specifically the idea of like, we're surrounded

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.640
 with all of these amazing techniques and opportunities, these prayers, like calling the lama from

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.140
 a far prayer by his Holiness, Duja Rinpoche, that's right at the beginning of this Nundro.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:11.160
 Sometimes it's just so amazing, these vodra songs, these descriptions of how enlightened

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.600
 beings are and what they see. Sometimes it's just so extraordinary that it actually can

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.520
 make us feel bad. Like, wow, another reason that I'm not really there yet. Like I read

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.120
 the prayer and it doesn't really kind of turn alive in my own heart and mind. And it kind

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.360
 of can do this kind of turn where it actually makes me have like a little bit of a distance

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.120
 from it, as if like I'm outside of that. And so this kind of heaviness can come. And this

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.600
 is just such a human thing. And I have so much sympathy for this. And so I'm just thinking

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.760
 about that and contemplating it in my experience. And I surely have a lot of feelings of just,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.280
 you know, trying to activate this joy and appreciation in bodhicitta and vodra pride.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.080
 This is the path, right? I mean, if it was already easy and could just turn on, then

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.000
 we'd all be there and done. There'd be no path. We would be free. But so we have a little

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 distance from this. I mean, each of us do. We're sentient beings. So it becomes this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.320
 really practical Dharma question of like, how can I, you know, use these tools and techniques,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.040
 these descriptions and stories, all these practices, how can I use them to relieve my

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.640
 burden, to relieve my suffering and not just become another way to feel bad or to feel

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.040
 guilty? And here I'm not saying guilty in like some kind of technical term. Okay. So

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.000
 I'm not a therapist and this isn't therapy. I think it's really good to just say that

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.880
 clearly. I don't have any professional expertise in terms of this deep emotional work. I really

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.440
 have a lot of respect for all the different kinds of therapeutic modalities there are

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:04.600
 for mind and body. It's just such an amazing to be so caring, to have taken the time to

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.880
 really learn different ways that the mind and the body function to help one another,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.320
 ourselves and others to attune, to heal, to find relief, to find happiness. I have so

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.520
 much honor for like really respect for that. People who do that. But this is kind of more

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.000
 along the lines of specifically of like Buddha Dharma. So talking about this topic of kind

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.880
 of releasing Buddhist guilt, so like this sense of heaviness we can have, even it's not so

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.600
 much like technically Buddhist guilt, but it's more like it does a sentient being just

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.120
 kind of feeling bad, like bummed out and like heavier by I'm not good enough. And then I'm

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.400
 like I identify as a Buddhist and so then it's like I'm a Buddhist and I have all these things

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.280
 I know I should do, could do these steps I could take and if I don't take them then it

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.280
 can make me feel worse. So what to do about that? So that's kind of the topic for this

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.720
 nundra. And I think it's just a really real human thing. I mean I think a lot of these

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.320
 topics and discussions is not trying to be like some like a nice saucy kind of new catchy

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.280
 title or something. Genuinely, myself and others that I've been in touch with for years,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.760
 this is a real issue. It's a real challenge. Especially in contemporary culture where there's

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.560
 so much about kind of low self-esteem and the lack of self-worth, a lack of kind of

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.600
 connectedness, a feeling a part of something, of having a defined purpose. These are in one

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.800
 way it's like kind of another like layer of pandemic of our time. And not to diagnose this

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.600
 problem really specifically or with too much time but contemporary culture it is kind of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.880
 more about what we have. It's kind of a tangible degenerate time, right? We have to demonstrate

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.000
 our worth by proving something, producing something, consuming something. What we have

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.120
 to show it, you know, it's very tangible and it's not so much about who we are, our being

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:17.880
 quality, the presence we bring, our ability to bear witness, the creative energy that

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:27.120
 we hold and engage something with, the love that we like generate just simply. Like a

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.100
 simple moment of kindness is so deep and profound. But we happen to be in kind of a lot of

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:33.520
 contemporary

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.560
 cultures in general, speaking generally that these kind of more quiet features sometimes

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.080
 we just call them emotions. Emotions kind of get overlooked a little and it's just what

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.840
 we do and how much we have and how big our bank account is and all that. So not to diagnose

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.600
 it too much but it's just to say this is a problem, it's a challenge, this is a big challenge.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.000
 So how do we have our dharma practice not become one more reason of why I suck, you

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.040
 know? How do we use it to inspire ourselves? Sometimes, he talks about getting out of the

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.680
 ditch. How can we get out of this specific ditch to find our inherent goodness and worth,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:24.200
 our value? So this is a gigantic topic but it's worth really, it's worth kind of looking

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.280
 at a little bit even to just publicly talk about it that we have this experience of the

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:35.680
 path can actually feel like too much, too hard but where could I even start? So alignment

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.560
 so far away, how could I ever get there? All save, all beings, help, all beings, how is

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.520
 that even possible? You know, this can become like a way that we actually prevent ourselves

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.880
 from connecting to the dharma, from connecting to our own goodness. So in the end, I mean

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.760
 kind of more speaking from more of the result of the path, like that's all that we're trying

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.240
 to do is recognize that goodness in ourselves and others, right? They say all the Buddha's

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.960
 teachings are about revealing that inherent goodness and removing what's temporarily blocking

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.720
 it, that that's what a Buddha is. A Buddha is one who completely removed all the temporary

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.480
 obscurations, the cognitive and emotional obscurations. They removed everything that

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:28.720
 was temporary. There was distracting, there was destabilizing from the true nature. There

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.800
 was adventitious, they're just temporary. They removed the stains and then after removing

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.840
 the stains, what did that happen? They revealed that inherent goodness in themselves and in

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:49.320
 others in all phenomena that everything is inherently good. We have this inherent goodness.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.000
 And so one way, to some degree, like dealing with a sense of this kind of heaviness or

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.040
 kind of when we lock up in response to the beauty of something, the beauty of a prayer,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.200
 the beauty of an opportunity, the magnificence of a practice or of a visualization, like

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:13.800
 sometimes we really need to use healthy habits like good conceptualization or a reframing.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:19.640
 And part of reframing really is even just the belief, that idea, I am good. You are

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:27.080
 good. We have this Buddha nature. This is what's essential. And all the things covering

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:36.920
 that up, they're temporary. They're stains. They are removable. These mistakes we've made,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.800
 the activities we do that are unhealthy or harmful, these are temporary mistakes. They

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.240
 are not essential. They are not who we are. And then Buddhism is very clear about this

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:58.960
 point. We are not inherently bad. We are inherently good. Every single being. And then Buddhism

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.700
 in Mahayana magnifies that. The very fabric, the empty open dynamic fabric of all reality

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:12.480
 is sparkling with love and compassion and wisdom. It's just woven in. It's like when

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.700
 the mind recognizes emptiness, it just turns on brightly as love and compassion and power.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:28.320
 Skillful means. This is conceptually and experientially, this is the fabric bedrock essential

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.800
 teaching

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:37.880
 of the Buddha. We are all good. And so that's just a conceptual framing. And we can read

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:46.000
 those teachings on Buddha nature. And we can read teachings on the 18 endowments. What

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.760
 are we so fortunate to not be under the limited by? We're not hell beings. We're not pretense.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.040
 There's this list of 18 endowments. Not only what do we avoid that's bad, what do we have

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.920
 that's wonderful? And we should conceptually really touch that. Really look into that.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:12.400
 Like in his book, a torch lighting the way to freedom, it's so beautiful, this table

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.480
 of contents. He goes through each of these 18 endowments. And it's just so lovely to

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:26.280
 even reconnect with that a little bit. Just a little. And if it's too much or if it becomes

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.880
 a long list, then we need to just kind of pace ourselves. We need to know our own minds

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.960
 a little bit. What helps my mind open up? If a whole list of 18 things doesn't do it and

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.580
 I just need one, one simple thing, then use the one simple thing. We don't have to open

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:52.200
 a door in 84,000 ways. We just have to open the door once. We need to connect to the medicine

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.400
 or the Dharma, the specific technique or the turning of the mind, the kind of attunement,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:05.560
 the one that helps my mind right now open up. We only need the one. We don't need all

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.880
 of them. So we have to like clearly look at our minds and see what is it that my mind

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.960
 is kind of like holding an unrealistic way and then what's the way to kind of release

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.880
 that holding. And I would read just because this is inspiring. Also in his Holies Deuterum

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:28.720
 is what counsels from my heart. "Of all the 84,000 sections of the Buddha's teachings,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:35.280
 none is more profound than bodhicitta. Make every effort on the path uniting absolute

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.720
 and relative bodhicitta. This distills the essence of all the sutras and the tantras.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.720
 The subduing of one's own mind is the root of Dharma. When the mind is controlled, defilements

00:15:48.720 --> 00:16:01.280
 naturally subside." Again, these are concepts that we hear and the path is to like directly

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.500
 taste this for ourselves, to experience it, to put it into practice and to transform how

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.360
 our mind is, how our heart is, which means just to connect with that goodness, to reveal

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:20.240
 that inherent dignity that we all have, the Buddha nature. But if too much complex complications,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.440
 if it doesn't help us, then distill it into bodhicitta. And if we need that, if that's

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.280
 too simple, then we can get more complex. Zoom into bodhicitta, relative bodhicitta

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.000
 and absolute bodhicitta, and what's a relative bodhicitta, aspiring bodhicitta and engaging

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.760
 bodhicitta. As aspirations, even if we're in a really dark place and we're stuck, we

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:47.960
 can wish and pray, we can aspire, that one day we'll be able to like totally mingle our

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.960
 minds with the Dharma. One day, may I really be a boat, a bridge, an island, the medicine,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.720
 like for all the beings wondering in samsara, the ocean of samsara, we can make that aspiration.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.560
 That's something that we can just turn our mind a little bit. It's so simple, but so

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:09.480
 profound. It really changes everything, to kind of have a little aspiration prayer. So

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.240
 if there's certain aspiration prayers, you know, then like write down a little aspiration

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.080
 prayer and every now and then kind of remind yourself of that. In Lama Chime, he would

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.680
 write line, Dharma lines, and then kind of paste them around his practice area to kind

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.640
 of tune in. He had, they said, on his puja table in Mondarava house in Florida, he had

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:37.460
 all these watches, impermanent. We need to use these conceptual reminders to reactivate

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:43.040
 our experience or to reinvigorate our practice. We should use these conceptual reminders, but

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.240
 they all come down to like actually tasting it for ourselves. It's one thing to hear about

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.760
 the Buddha nature or that Vajra pride to hear about it. And that is really important to

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.600
 turn our minds to that possibility. Because if we're not aware of a possibility, it's

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.200
 really hard to consciously undergo a process to awaken that possibility or to actualize

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.480
 the possibility. We do need to frame in a certain way and use concepts that are healthy

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.120
 and helpful for us. But in the end, it's about actually the transformation. So what are the

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.800
 steps of actually awakening that dignity, that competence, the courage in my experience?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.440
 Where then the Dharma like, wow, the kind of amazing stories and it's like everything

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:29.120
 can be inspiring and uplifting and the challenges can be much more of like opportunity to purify

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.040
 or an opportunity to help, an opportunity to surrender to the goodness, to the Dharma,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:40.120
 to the natural flow of cause and effect. So that's, we need to actually kind of transform.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.000
 That's what it's leading to. So they say practice, right? We use study and practice and we need

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.480
 to balance these two. And Pali is pariyati and pati-pati. Pati-pati, we study. This was

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.560
 so valuable to memorize text, to write out Dharma teachings of the Buddha. There's so

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:03.080
 much merit and good positive virtuous energy that we can generate doing things like this.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.600
 And so much about the path is just to generate virtue, is to become disciplined in being

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:17.560
 virtuous, to have a longing to be helpful, to be a valuable service, to like have that

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:25.000
 goodness come out, to have like this longing to care for others. And then in the practical

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.600
 application of that, they say like in this book, there's a new book by Patra Karmiche,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.000
 Awakening Dignity. Awakening Dignity by Patra Karmiche. This specifically is going over

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.320
 this specific topic of how to awaken dignity, of how to actually, what are the steps we

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:52.800
 do to come out of this kind of closed mindedness or like shut down experience, this tension

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.320
 we have that's not natural. But how do we release it? How do we awaken it? And he has

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.040
 a few lines in here that are really, so many lines were really helpful and I've only just

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:15.240
 started looking at this, but he said, "Compassion is how we begin. Wisdom is how we grow. And

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:25.760
 dignity is how we are." I thought that was so profound. Compassion is where we begin.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:33.560
 Wisdom is how we grow. Dignity is how we are. So how we begin, how we grow, and how we are.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.200
 We can begin with compassion. So if it's hard to have compassion for oneself, self-love,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 self-care, I know in contemporary times, this seems like it's a lot harder to do than to

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:50.120
 care for someone else. So if it's easier to care for someone else, there's so many opportunities

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.920
 for that in really small ways. And we can start with quiet, subtle, imperceptible ways

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:02.160
 like aspiring bodhicitta, like reciting for boundless. Take some extra time to just recite

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.880
 for boundless, just slowly. You can say one and then pause. May all beings have happiness

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.200
 and the cause of happiness. May all beings be free from suffering and the cause of suffering.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.840
 May all beings never be dissociated from the supreme happiness which is without suffering.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.160
 May all beings remain in boundless equanimity, free from both attachment to close ones and

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.320
 rejection of others. Of all the world, like throughout the whole world, of all the words

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:41.840
 said today, one time, at least, the for boundless was recited. It actually, reality, let that

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:49.240
 happen. That's such a big view. All beings have happiness. I always love it when Ken

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.880
 Busanwandoni Rinpoche talks about the for boundless. Because he always gets so gushy. Gushy and

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.560
 he like sizzles and like kind of sparks on. Because it's the dharma. It's like the heart

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.560
 of the dharma. It's the heart of bodhicitta, this aspiring bodhicitta. May all beings be

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.760
 free of suffering and the causes of suffering. It's so simple to say this and just let your

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.320
 mind be with that, even the sound of it. Just the idea that it happened in this space. That's

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:23.080
 such a thought. That such an aspiration was made. It becomes a noble space. It becomes

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:30.880
 like a sacred place. That such profound dharma was set. And you said it. I said it. And I'm

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.400
 just repeating something, but it connects directly to the nature. Then in addition,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.960
 do Tonglen. Awaken that really that kind of passionate, compassionate care for all beings

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.240
 to love them so viscerally. Like they're your only child, children. Then I want to help them

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.360
 activate that kind of sense of like really kind of leaning in responsibility. That courageous

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.280
 leaning in. I'll take on their suffering. I'll give them my happiness. Just as if it

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:08.440
 was my own baby who was sick. Or if it was like a wounded animal in front. You know,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.120
 sometimes this little baby is so easy to love. And sometimes it's someone who's really writhing

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.960
 and a lot of pain is like lashing out. It's like a wounded animal who can't help but try

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:24.600
 to bite someone if they go to help them. We can use Tonglen. Practice like Tonglen. We

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:30.400
 can just do it quietly. We don't have to tell anyone. We don't have to change our posture.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.960
 It's all about kind of our mind and opening and our heart opening. And what is that? Connecting

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.320
 to that fundamental dignity. That goodness we have. That's all the teachings are going

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:46.320
 towards revealing that fundamental goodness. And removing what is obscuring it or blocking

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.640
 it. Shutting it down. So these doubts that we have as a human realm being. Doubt and

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.280
 hesitation are the big stumbling blocks. These doubts I have about myself and about the Dharma

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.000
 and about cause and effect and about all these things. Yes, there's a doubt that leads us

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.920
 towards the nature. And then there's doubt that leads us away from the nature. Venerable

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:14.120
 Kimberly Chase have been really clear about this. The doubt that leads us toward the nature

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:19.200
 activates our compassion, activates our wisdom, activates our dignity. That inherent goodness

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:28.040
 or that power, the skillful versatility of creative kind of mind. Healthy doubt awakens

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:34.600
 those qualities. So we're getting closer to our natural state of being. Unhealthy doubt

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.880
 blocks us from that sparkling energy of our own inherent goodness. So we can discern.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.360
 Is this doubt making me more tense, more reactive, more closed-minded, more prideful? Or is it

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.720
 making me more at ease, more connected, more enlivened, more enthusiastic? So we need to

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.720
 be clear about which is happening in our experience. And we need to really have this discernment.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.400
 When a technique is really like helping me connect to my goodness. And so many of the

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:20.640
 kind of easy avenue, little easier access ones are rooted in compassion. A genuine care

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.040
 for others. And we can start small. We can start with more of a meta where we love just

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.440
 one person who's easy to love. Someone in our lives who we're really close with. We

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.480
 can expand that to include more beings we love. We can expand that to include ourselves,

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.800
 our family. And we can gradually grow these muscles or open these capacities that we have

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.520
 to connect to our goodness in little by little. They'll grow. Like the great Shanti Deva said,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.320
 that's the quality of a habit. The more we do it, the easier it becomes. Then we have

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.600
 to discern whether it's a good habit. And so it's helping us on the path or it's a bad

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.640
 habit. And it's blocking our way on the path. And that's up to our own discernment. And

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.400
 following kind of the guidance of our teachers and of course the great Buddha Shakyamuni

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.560
 and Guru Rinpoche. We have so many kind of avenues of helping us line up with what actually

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:27.360
 to make healthy decisions kind of have a more wise discernment. So there's really a lot

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:33.640
 of things to say about this. But one thing is this that helped me too also in this book,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.800
 Awakening Dignity. I thought in my mind, Vajrasattva practice we all know. This is really the big

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:46.720
 purification practice in Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhist worldview. To connect with Buddha

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.560
 Vajrasattva. And how do we connect with Buddha Vajrasattva with the four powers? The four

00:26:52.560 --> 00:27:00.840
 powers. And what was helpful in this book is Patra Girmaje, he called them the four healing

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:14.000
 powers. And it really changed something in my mind. The four healing powers. Okay. Hmm.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.920
 This is so curious because in a, so this is like to take a little bit of a sidestep, but

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.500
 the sutra approach in general in terms of the Buddha's teachings, it kind of posits

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:32.000
 something's broken and we have to fix it. Something's wrong. Like there's a burning

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.200
 house or I got shot with an arrow or like there's this ocean of suffering or a pit of

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:45.260
 vipers or my hair's on fire. Like there's a problem and I need to remedy the problem.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.800
 So in that way of holding these kind of situations of life in the kind of, in the sutra mode,

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.240
 which is if I'm in that mode, then I need a sutra response to that mode and all the

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:03.640
 responses are therapeutic. The Dharma is talked about as a medicine. There's some kind of

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:11.800
 a healing that needs to happen. There's some kind of a realignment, a correction, a purification.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:17.680
 Right? So this is all kind of in the sutra language of like when my mind, when my mind

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.240
 believes something's broken, something's wrong, something is not okay and it needs to be changed

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.120
 somehow, transformed, purified, distanced, get space. That's sutra mode, which is so

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.480
 important because in my mind is like that all the time. Something's wrong. What do I

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:43.640
 do? Suffering causes suffering. The tantra mode isn't in a therapeutic modality. It says

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:49.240
 it's all good. There's nothing wrong. There's no samsara. There's no nirvana. These are

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.360
 just conceptual designations we're holding onto because we're just not seeing clearly

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.420
 what actually is happening. So they don't talk about a problem and its remedy or like

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.320
 kind of a challenge and our response. They talk about directly connecting to a way of

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.280
 seeing and being that doesn't have this mistaken way of holding, of creating a problem that

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:18.520
 wasn't there. It's called a tantric mode. But here, the four healing supports. Then it kind

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.280
 of has both of these. In my mind, it's okay, vajrasattva, Buddha of compassion, Buddha

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.820
 of purification. Because sometimes you're like, oh, I have all this bad stuff I need

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.180
 to purify. You know, again, I'm so bad. I have all this bad stuff and I need to get

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:37.200
 rid of it. So it kind of locks into that similar, I'm so bad thing. And I need to use this Buddha

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.160
 to do it. But it's like more of a healing. It's like, I'm worth it. I have the value

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:48.920
 to do this. I have this goodness there, but I need the support to help reveal this goodness.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.920
 To have the courage to recognize there's nothing wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with

00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:01.300
 the situation. If I don't have that courageous view, that's why I do vajrasattva practice.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.840
 So what are these four healing supports? One is to have remorse. And that's a very clear

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:15.160
 discernment. To clearly see all this thing I did, the thing I said, that response I did,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.040
 the grimace I said, the kind of bad fumbling words or like kind of the emotional upheaval

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:28.460
 I kind of like shot out there into the world. It wasn't good. It was harmful. I feel bad

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:34.360
 about that. That discernment of recognizing a negative emotion as a negative emotion,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:41.080
 a destructive emotion as a destructive emotion, as something this dish, this harmonious or

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.480
 like that closes us from our natural goodness. That's a lot of wisdom there to recognize

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.800
 that. And we need that wisdom to be able to discern healthy habit from unhealthy habit.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.960
 So this has talked about as remorse. The first healing support is to recognize something

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.840
 negative as being negative and to feel bad about it. Oh, I don't want to, this is all

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.120
 this anger happening in me. All of a sudden the anger isn't me. It's something that was

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.040
 happening in me or that I expressed. So there's a little distance there. And I don't want

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.760
 to be, I don't want to have this anger kind of take me over all the time. That recognition

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:24.240
 that I'm not angry, I'm not anger, something I just experienced temporarily. There's a

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.480
 lot of wisdom there. And then I feel bad about this. I don't, I'm not, I'm not an angry person.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.400
 I don't want to be an angry person. I don't want to just constantly like put fires everywhere.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.560
 I'm talking about destructive anger, right? Not constructive, you know, healthy kind of

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.600
 tough love. I'm talking about like kind of really harmful anger. But so this remorse

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.200
 is seeing a negativity and wanting to like not keep doing it. And then we need support.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.560
 That's the second healing support. Actual have support. Well, I need help to not do

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:03.160
 that again. So there's an external support and an internal one. In this case of Adrasapha

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.400
 practice, the external support is Buddha of Adrasapha, who is like the total embodiment

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.720
 of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and of your own personal teacher, is the essential

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.320
 goodness, all the qualities of the awakened ones, Arhats and Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.560
 So this is kind of the more Vajrayana or the Buddhist support. It's the venerable sublime

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.240
 noble support. But then there's also other external supports we can use like good trustworthy

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:36.440
 friends or good professional like specialists who have a genuine ability and intention to

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.480
 help us. They can help us correct like, oh, we have remorse about something we did wrong.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:50.080
 We can depend on their advice. We can actually go to them and confide. Oh, this wasn't, you

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.640
 know, in a trustful kind of safe situation. I'm not don't feel so good about doing this

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.600
 or thinking this way or doing that. And we can rely on their support. What are they helping

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.160
 us point towards the inner support? The inner support is our inherent goodness, our inherent

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.040
 intelligence, compassion and wisdom. They're helping us direct direct us to see that in

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.960
 ourselves. They're not saying you need to rely on me forever. They're pointing us to

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.680
 see ourselves more clearly to come from that place in ourselves, that Buddha nature that

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:28.440
 has that wisdom and that compassion and that love. So in the end, that's the internal support.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.560
 That's kind of where all this is going towards all these teachings. And then the third healing

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:41.480
 support is the antidote. One way if there's a negativity that we did, we can like have

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:48.120
 an antidote of like doing the opposite, positive kind of it's a counteractive measure. If we

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.960
 were kind of really overwhelmed by anger, then we can like try to intentionally cultivate

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:00.360
 patience. Patience is just a willingness to be with reality as it's happening and to not

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:06.240
 wish it changed somehow. And that's really so much easier to say than do. But we can

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.560
 cultivate that. There's Paramita practices of patience. Buddha taught so many systematic

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.760
 ways taking step by step on how to cultivate such a quality as patience or all the other

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.520
 Paramitas as well. That's an antidote. We can also receive the blessing wisdom nectar

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:28.640
 of Adrasattva as an antidote to instantly relieve and release all of our negativity,

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.200
 all of our attachment, all of our distorted perceptions, all of the certain wrongdoings

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:41.680
 and tendencies towards them. That's an antidote. And then fourthly, the fourth healing support

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:48.640
 is the conviction or the commitment to really not want to repeat that mistake or that negativity,

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.080
 that kind of tension or like close mindedness to not want to repeat it. So we kind of make

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.400
 a firm commitment. And even though as human beings, then we think, oh, well, I might do

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.440
 that again. But little by little, if we really try to have that firm resolve again and again,

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.600
 it becomes stronger over time. And we actually don't want to do it anymore. And then we start

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:16.480
 doing it less. And eventually that we actually it just becomes something we can just drop.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.920
 So it's little by little, little by little. So that's also kind of part of connecting

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.760
 to this goodness and not being overwhelmed by having Dharma kind of be experiences like

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:32.080
 a burden, another thing we have to do another kind of job, you know, little by little. This

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.760
 is drop by drop. And part of that is, is like a regularity. And again, I think Pachara Pache

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.840
 in this book, Awakening Dignity talks about regularity towards the very end of this book.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:52.480
 In 217, both training and practice require that we shift our focus from thinking about

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.280
 our ordinary worries and difficulties to understanding the mind and its nature.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:05.600
 Doing so on a daily basis enhances our experience of dignity. The key is maintaining steady,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:12.000
 consistent effort without grasping at the result. The goal is to neither be dejected by poor

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.560
 practice

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:19.120
 or related by strong practice. Then we become our own master and not the victim of others opinions

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.400
 or of our own fleeting emotions. At that point, the effect of our meditation will show in our

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.000
 daily life. We will be more content and at ease, and our qualities of compassion and love will

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.680
 shine naturally. This is the sign we're improving and that our meditation experience, behavior and

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.480
 view are in harmony. So here the point I thought to highlight was this daily basis. It's like in

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:42.800
 small

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:50.640
 ways, short sessions many times, short moments many times, in small ways to kind of regularly

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.240
 try to reconnect to our goodness. And we do that by activating our compassion for others

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:02.480
 and by increasing our discernment, our wisdom with things like is this healthy doubt or unhealthy

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.960
 doubt? Is this a negativity or positivity? Is this making me more connected towards the dharma or

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.360
 less connected towards the dharma? So that becomes how we grow this wisdom. And then in the end or

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.760
 towards the end, then like as our practice stabilizes, we do things little by little,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.120
 like with some regularity, little by little. So it's not just some big burden we feel bad

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.840
 we couldn't get to again, but it has to be at a pace with our own life, our own mind,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.000
 where we actually can do it. Little by little, we'll connect to that dignity and have that

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.920
 confidence, encourage, kind of awaken more in our experience. And then as it is always with these

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.720
 sessions, like I'm a totally lost, wondering, deluded, guilt-ridden, sentient being, like,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.960
 but there are noble ones in the world. Like Hemvaseyandanya Rinpoche,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:02.320
 like there's so many masters, there's so many noble beings and take the time to learn from them,

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.640
 to be in their presence, to sincerely, like, kind of develop a relationship that's like,

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.840
 you know, where they get to know you some, and you get to know them better and cultivate that trust

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:15.840
.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.800
 And to actually be in the presence of some of these beings, then they'll help us have more and

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.360
 more certainty, wisdom or conviction that these aren't just ideas, they're not just beliefs,

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.960
 that everyone's fundamentally good. But to actually taste that in your own experience,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.880
 and little by little, we do taste that. And then those tastes, those experiences start to get

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.240
 longer, and they start to permeate more of our experience, and we become more convinced

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.040
 that we're fundamentally good than that we're fundamentally bad.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:52.640
 Our courage awakens based on our own practical lived experience. So we need to do whatever the

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.000
 supportive circumstances for our mind are, with some nourishing, peaceful, encouraging love,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.680
 and also with some tough love, like if we have certain habits that we know are too overwhelming,

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.960
 and they really shut us down, and they activate kind of the most destructive parts of ourselves,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.320
 we need to be more kind of courageous and strong about that. And just to like really put some kind

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.000
 of strong lines around certain things we just won't do, it's too harmful, too harmful for

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.320
 ourselves or others. And that's part of having good, like, renunciation. So we need to also be

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.640
 really clear about that. And in the end, it all comes down to bodhicitta again and again. It really

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:39.200
 is what this whole path comes down to, this bodhicitta. And like, I think as we, yeah,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:46.560
 the further we go, I think, I mean, really, it's just, it's really the answer to all of our

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.360
 questions, bodhicitta, and it becomes something that we see in our own experience, and by being

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:58.240
 around in the presence of noble ones, and in good community, the sangha, practicing kind of

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.880
 little by little, the teachings of the Buddha, this bodhicitta really becomes, oh, this really

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:11.760
 is the soul panacea. This really is both the supreme healing, as well as the completely

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:24.000
 unfabricated natural, total pervasive naturalness of life. It can be that healing balm, and it also

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 can just be that relaxed, at ease, spacious naturalness. It has both sutra and tantra.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 It really is kind of the, what all these practices line up with. It's the root and essence of all

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 these practices. So thanks so much for just kind of letting me kind of care for this topic a little

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.600
 bit. Again, this is a, it's a special topic in that I know, you know, the years go by. And for

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:55.810
 my own self and for others, this can, the heaviness of like having guilt or having things that,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:55.920
 that

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.440
 happened to us before, or like, things that we bring from our life into the dharma, which we can't

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.280
 help because we are ourselves, and we engage the dharma according to who we are, our humanness.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:15.280
 Like, it's a real tenderness I have that as much, as much as we can to like, really, how can we

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:21.200
 skillfully engage the dharma according to our own minds and our own hearts? And I really have a

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.680
 tenderness around that. Because, you know, it's hard, it's hard to see myself fumbling with the

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.600
 same kind of same challenge and the years go by, and they just stack up, you know? It's like, oh,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.800
 what can I do to like, just be more skillful about this? And if you're kind of experiencing a

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.120
 similar

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.840
 thing, and really genuinely like to have consider, like love for yourself, like, what can I do to

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.080
 not

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:50.080
 have this be the same problem 10 years from now? Like to love yourself that much. They say that,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:56.960
 if you look at yourself in the future, like with some, as if like, kind of give yourself a lot of

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:03.440
 reasons about why you want to care for that future you. Oh, why are you going to save money for the

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.080
 future you? So you can, because you're worth it, you're valuable, you're going to have the, like,

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.320
 you want this Buddha nature to come out more, you want the supportive conditions for you in the

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.880
 future to flourish, to connect more, to have more time for dharma, more time to serve in the

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.360
 teachings.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:23.200
 Like, if you see this future you in a more kind of rosy light, more connecting to its goodness,

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.880
 actually, it'll help you activate the steps that kind of lead towards that. Instead of just,

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:34.000
 oh, it's me now, and I'm going to put what has happening today always in the front.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.280
 And then just think what it would be like if we thought of everyone like that.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.560
 Buddha is, Buddha's teaching is so profound. It's trying to orient towards the future.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:51.680
 Use now to make the future better for all beings. And then it gives this long list of reasons why

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:58.800
 all beings are so valuable and why oneself is so valuable. This is, like, such a profound set of

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.920
 psycho technologies that we can taste in simple ways right now in our experience. So really use

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.320
 whatever lines up with your own mind, your own heart to do that. And step by step we're in this

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:19.460
 together. There's no way out. So let's, like, make it really nice for each other. Okay? It's all,

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:19.520
 it's

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.600
 really all good. I'm really glad we get to be in this together forever because we're all really

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:30.720
 good. So yeah, thank you. Sending love. Then we'll do this practice together. This is Dhujintar

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.240
 Sanandar practice. We'll do just a silent sit here quietly, and then we'll begin with this prayer

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:48.720
 calling the Lama from afar. Bye. Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thanks so much.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:58.160
 Thank you. I thought I just really quick few little kind of closing things. One, in terms of

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.960
 kind of lightening up one's practice, I think a good support I found is if there's certain

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.080
 prayers that otherwise might be kind of intimidating, like they're so glorious and

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:19.680
 resplendent and at ease and just somewhat over like otherworldly or so beyond to like just pick one

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:27.280
 and read it really slowly and just let yourself be with it kind of like read a line and just kind

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:33.440
 of pause then read a line pause and kind of let your mind kind of the space of your attention

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.800
 of your awareness just kind of be with it as you read it instead of just kind of trying to charge

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.480
 through it but just really take your time and just kind of give yourself the space to kind of like

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:52.000
 resonate with the prayer the meaning and then secondly in Vajrayana practice one point that

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.360
 I found really helpful is that so much of the like a mantra recitation for example is said to be

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:05.360
 self reciting so it's almost like instead of it's instead of like because we're practicing and

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:13.600
 meditating it produces the result of this mantra happening instead of that it's actually like we

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:20.400
 like turn the corner of a room and you like look in some other thing happening and like the party's

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:28.560
 already going and we just didn't see it before or it's like a the channel of the tv is already

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:35.360
 kind of streaming along in the in the air and we just tune into it being there so it takes off the

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.680
 sense of their beings like I have to do all this work to produce this amazing thing like a mantra

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.360
 or a visualization and instead it's just it's like the self-resounding sound of the nature of the

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:54.000
 self-resounding expression or form of the nature of one's goodness it's almost just like you show

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.200
 up and kind of can't believe it like this sense of awe of like wow this is happening how wonderful

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.320
 and to kind of like hold the practice a little more in that kind of a space that's

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:10.540
 really technically how they say like the specific instructions around that with Vajrayana and third

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:10.640
ly

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.600
 if there's something that kind of it's a habitual hang-up that your mind keeps looping back into

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.560
 kind of a negative story or some kind of a something that like really keeps kind of like

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.520
 closing you up and shutting you down so i'd say part of like one thing i found helpful is

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.920
 would we do a practice session however long it is that when we get to the dedication of the merit

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:38.960
 that we really think of that specific kind of imbalance or that mistake we made and we

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:46.880
 specifically also dedicate that positive virtue to bring resolution to that specific imbalance

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.480
 to if we harm someone for example in the past to really dedicate specifically intentionally

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:59.040
 think of like sending the virtue of the practice you just did to heal that to help that person to

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.880
 resolve that conflict and so like we can do that from a distance and quietly we don't have to say

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.400
 anything about it to anyone else so we don't have to we can prevent any other conflict or something

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.670
 from arising but really like as an offering like as a way of kind of kind of forgiving the

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.880
 situation

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.880
 forgiving oneself for forgiving kind of making amends and like so we can move on in our practice

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.560
 but do it with a sense of kindness and like love and care for that being too or that situation to

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.600
 like kind of to care for ourselves enough to try to resolve that so we can kind of let our

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.400
 compassion and wisdom and love kind of shine out more brightly so there are a few little thoughts

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.200
 thank you friends so much thank you very much

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:54.880
