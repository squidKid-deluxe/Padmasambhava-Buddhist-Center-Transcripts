00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.030
 "Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thank you again. Good evening, everyone. Again, I'm so

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.640
 thankful and so grateful. I have, again, this great opportunity to be with you all and discussing

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 the teaching of the Buddha Dharma according my capabilities.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 So, I'm very grateful for that opportunity. So, for that reason, I'd like to thank everyone for

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.640
 participating and coming together and organizing all of this teaching by the Musmar Buddha Center

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.880
 in Poland and as well as Yixinongkou Center in Poland.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.240
 And I'm so grateful to thank all of you, and friends, and all the members, and everyone who

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.200
 participated and supported to activate this event.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.080
 And so, thank you again. Good evening, and thank you very much, everyone, okay?

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.820
 Now, we will talk about the Buddha teaching, and that's what you came here, and that's what I'm

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.040
 here, so we talk about the Buddha teaching.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 In order to begin the Buddha teaching or the practices in Buddhism, what did the Buddha show you?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.940
 There are three things. Starting the teaching, contemplate on the teaching, and meditate in

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.800
 practice on the teachings.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.780
 That is what is, when we do practice or when we do the teaching of the Buddha Dharma, we do these

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 three things.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 These are known as also three verses, verses that come from the studying, verses that come from the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.040
 contemplating and reflecting teaching, and analyzing, and then verses that come from practice and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.520
 meditation, comes from that.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.320
 In order to begin any of those verses, we should correct our beautiful motivations.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.970
 Generally, we all have beautiful motivations. You all come here to like to learn the Buddha

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.320
 teaching, like to know what is about the Buddha teaching and meditation.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.040
 What is, generally, the Buddha teaching is nothing but one's own true nature.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.070
 Your true nature, my true nature, in the nature of everything, that's what the Buddha can express

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.720
 it, point it out.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.440
 Buddha didn't tell anything other than what nature it is.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.810
 What is the nature of you and me is the nature of your mind, my mind, which is known as, then, low

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.640
 kindness, compassion, joy, and appreciation.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.240
 Under three ways, things are exactly as it is, on a relative level and as well as an absolute level

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.600
.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.160
 Bring exactly as it is, not understated, not overstated, exactly as it is.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.520
 That simple, direct teaching is the teaching of the Buddha. That's nothing else.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.280
 That direct, simple, that is your nature and my nature.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 That is what we are going to activate it, going forward.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.760
 Not let the same, underneath, mix of the duality and the fabrication, habit, patterns.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 We like to reveal, bring up that from completely, as it is shining from the bottom, we like to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.600
 bring that on the surface.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.800
 Really, that every direction, that starts right now with you.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.240
 What are those? Those are known as, bring more joy, more appreciation.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.300
 Joy and appreciation and both each other, kindness compared to all living beings without any

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.880
 discrimination.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 Then, understand exactly where things are in reality or ultimate levels.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.040
 That is known as Vajrayana practice, Vajrayana teachings. We are following that.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 It means according to Vajrayana teaching, everything is enlightened status.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.000
 There is nothing that is not enlightened. Everything is enlightened.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 Enlight is not something strange when making new things, it is not there.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.240
 We are revealing that nature exactly as it is.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.160
 That is for that reason, when we reflect the teaching, when we start reflecting the teaching,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.000
 meditate in the practice of the teaching, always in the teaching said,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.880
 bring out the beautiful motivation. That motivation is, that is to start our enlightenment,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.000
 our bring up nature. That starts with joy and appreciation.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.720
 Joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation is very important.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.280
 We have so many reasons to build joy and appreciation.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.000
 This is again, I always tell that and my brother, that brother, beloved teacher,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.760
 he also used to always remind me again and again, we have so many things to celebrate the joy

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.960
 and appreciate it. Many times we are missing the point. We are looking always outside,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.240
 looking, looking that what we have really don't kind of appreciate and recognize that and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.320
 acknowledge that. We have to acknowledge, we have to appreciate and reflect on that.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.880
 So bring more joy and appreciation, both the spiritual level and as well as worldly level.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.200
 Worldly level, every time we have a lot of reason to be joy and appreciate it.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.840
 We are all are in one of the best countries on this earth, prosperity, peace, freedom,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.480
 all that beautifulness. We are this beautiful country and therefore we have reason to be joy

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.280
 and appreciate it. Spiritual level in the Buddha's teaching said, if you read the Buddha's teaching

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.280
,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:38.320
 we have 18 luxurious qualities, 18 luxurious qualities. We have 10, at freedoms, 10 luxuries.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.800
 This is not just to extend any of those who are accidental. Truly we have beautiful cause and

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.000
 condition, circumstances, both of that situation, very, very prosperity, very abundance of luxuries

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.000
,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.880
 both worldly level and spiritual level, Dharma level. Therefore joy and appreciation is something

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.880
 beautiful, that this is something we did in the past, good things. And now we should continue that

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.440
 even activate and glorify what we did past, bring more even better and beautiful product and well,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.920
 our future will be beautiful, brightest. Future is dependent upon now. Now is the foundation

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.840
 of the future, what we like to do that. That's what Buddha's gracious teacher,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.640
 Buddha Hekkarman pointed out again and again times. We should take care of now. Now is the time.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.560
 Now is in our control. Past is past. We don't really have any control too much. Future is

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.320
 upcoming things. We don't have too much control, but present is in our hand at each status. We have

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.240
 the whole, every kind of like situation and circumstance. True, magnificent, beautiful,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.320
 is in your hand, is in my hand. Therefore we have the good freedom and favorable conditions that

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.680
 we really have. Therefore, bring joy and appreciation. It's very, very important.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.360
 That is the foundation of the practice. That is foundation of Dharma, Dharma and spiritual.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:13.920
 Whoever have the joy and appreciation, that brings calm and peaceful and a nice happiness.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.640
 That's what we want. We want peace and harmony and happiness. And that start with joy and

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.280
 appreciation. That's so important. Second things are so important things. We must extend our

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.960
 beautiful qualities, beautiful attitude. We are known as bodhicata. Many of you know bodhicata.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.320
 And kindness is a component of all living beings. Even we have such a beautiful qualities. Even

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.880
 they have such a beautiful qualities. Many of them don't recognize. Still they are suffering. Still

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.880
 they are struggling. Still they are completely spoiling their goodness things by their own

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.800
 misdeeds, spoiling. What is that? That is known as the Buddha's teaching, unknowing situations,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.440
 ignorance. And that, so many things happening. And then plus there are so many beings who are

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.200
 really having a lot of difficult troubles. So really sincerely to bring more loving kindness,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.160
 complete thought and aspirations, reach everyone's joy and happy peace. Normal or troubled or

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.280
 difficult or cause trouble or difficult may extend immediately bring more joy and peace,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.400
 happiness. Not just a joy and peace for time being, but continually joy and peace, happiness.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.240
 All under the disc over there completely innate pure natures. We think that is strongly in the

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.800
 heart and mind known as bodhicata. And then vedayana teachings is already enlightened. That

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.040
 also should bring because what we are going to discuss tonight is vedayana teachings.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.240
 So we should kind of start that right now. It's not just that they can't wait until some time.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:55.920
 Now is so important. Start that kind of activities now. And therefore, again, all is enlightened.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.600
 What is in the universe and world outside or there? There is a form, sound, and mind or the

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.880
 space. There's only three things. There's nothing more than that. What do you always, is a form,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:18.000
 sound in the mind and the space or mind. There's only three things, three things. And form is

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.040
 enlightened status. Form is in light, in the code of vedayana teaching, is enlightened.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:32.000
 Form started from dharmakaya. Great emptiness started. Form is not just came like that form.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.480
 It's display of the emptiness, dharmakaya. Therefore, it is enlightened forms. Therefore,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.400
 in vedayana teaching, you see vedayana forms, vedayana bodies. Vedayana is enlightened status.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.640
 And sound is also same thing. Come from the dharmakaya, great emptiness. So it's enlightened

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.560
 sense. And mind and space is already enlightened. Also, it comes from the emptiness. It's a

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.840
 reflection of the display of the, from all that from the dharmadhatu or dharmakaya in the

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.760
 emptiness states. Therefore, it is enlightened. Everything is enlightened status. Only the, our

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:17.120
 duality publication kind of beloved that reality of the nature, where things are, duality become

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:24.800
 the s like a curtain, beat when the reality is, and where our, our mind is seen. And then just

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.240
 completely blocked, completely blurred. Otherwise, it is, everything is enlightened state. So those

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.840
 kind of attitude or those motivation is very important to bring up that, that. Now we just

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.120
 told what we're going to discuss here in the teaching. Now is the teaching of the Buddha

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.960
 Shakyamuni of course. Buddha Shakyamuni who came to two thousand six hundred years ago and he gave

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.560
 varieties of the teachings that according to the reading suits with the individualist,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.120
 different individualist. Those old teachings are known as nayana teachings. Nine different levels

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.640
 of the individualist, the readiness, according to their, their readiness, Buddha kind of like

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.920
 taught those different nine level teachings. It's like kind of big

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.760
 buffet styles, the buffet. And there's a big banquet of the buffet, buffet layout,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.440
 and whatever you like to eat, you can eat that. So it's not just a fourth and one food to everyone,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.640
 but according to whatever you like. If you like to only eat like to eat salad, there is a salad.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.720
 If you like to eat, eat like kind of fruit only, there's fruit. If you like to eat chocolate or

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.600
 there is chocolate and cream cheese and cheesecake and all of that. And then you have to eat like

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.000
 pastas. There is a pastas and then you like to eat rice, chapati or tortilla and whatever you like

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.160
 to

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.120
 eat and vegetarian, non-vegetarian, all the big banquet of buffet that in a way really similar that

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:02.400
 Buddha displayed, those old teachings are known as nayana teachings. Nine and all lead to the

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.800
 enlightenment. Every teaching of what Buddha is teaching with enlightenment. What are all those,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.320
 what nature of every teaching is non-violence. It is truth. It is truth, loving kindness,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.600
 compassion and kindness, courage, commitment. And that is really the teachings and discover that

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.800
 nature ignited that nature to the other basis so that everyone find their nature. They are grown,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.240
 their basic goodness find. And that is the old teachings, old Buddha layout. And there's all

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:46.450
 teachings. Then as I said, nayana teachings. Among the nayana teaching, this, tonight what we're

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:46.560
 going

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:56.770
 to talk is the teachings on the ninth, ninth. Ninth teaching is the highest teaching, deepest

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.360
 teaching,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.160
 more direct teaching to the true nature of where things are. Others are like kind of Buddha give

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:12.000
 according their readiness. So there is again need to go, need to go, need to explore, explore. But

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.920
 ninth teaching is the direct, the profounder teaching. And ninth teaching is known as then

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:26.400
 Mahaati teachings. Atiyoa teaching or Mahaati and the common name is known as the Dokti teachings.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:34.640
 So that is nayana teachings, Dokti teachings. Now Dokti teaching, I will talk really kind

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.440
 of in his story. I think it's a need to tell a little bit stories. Generally when the Buddha

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.600
 Shakyamuni give this Dokti teachings. Dokti teaching did not, Buddha did not give Dokti teaching

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.240
 in the form of the Buddha that as we always see the statues that Buddha begging bowl and

00:13:52.240 --> 00:14:02.080
 sorry, yellow robes and that kind of forms did not give the Buddha teachings.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:10.160
 Buddha give in the form of the Dharmakaya level, the Buddha give Dokti teachings. Dokti teachings.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.280
 So how in the Dokti teachings says, Dokti teachings are presented through three lineages.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.400
 And those lineages are known as mind to mind transmission lineage, symbolic transmission

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:33.200
 lineage and oral transmission lineage. Dokti teaching or nayana teachings in three different

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.760
 levels, three different lineage systems and Buddha transmitted these Dokti teachings.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:47.520
 Now the first one is mind to mind transmission lineage through that Buddha transmitted.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:56.800
 And which form, Buddha transform this teaching in the form of Buddha, Samadabhadra. Samadabhadra

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.240
 is known as, Buddhas can be divided into three Buddhas. Those are known as, many of you know

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.000
 who must be known and we know that and few of you don't know those are known as Dharmakaya Buddha,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.240
 Sambokaya Buddha and Nirmakaya Buddhas. Now three Buddhas. There are also three

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:25.920
 Buddhas. It's the same in light beings, but the Buddha appeared in three different poems in order

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:34.880
 to benefiting or to transmitting the teachings. Now the nayana, according to Dokchin or Mahadhi

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.120
 teaching, that what we're going to discuss, Dokti teaching or Mahadhi teaching, this nayana

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.920
 teaching,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:46.960
 according to that level, these three Buddhas can be divided into nine different Buddhas.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.400
 How? This is known as Dharmakaya Buddha can be divided into three more Buddhas

00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:03.840
 and those are known as Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya and Dharmakaya Buddha of Sambokaya

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:15.120
 and Dharmakaya Buddha of Nirmakayas. Three Buddhas divided even the Dharmakaya Buddha.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.200
 Dharmakaya Buddha are divided into three different Buddhas. Now who gave this Dokti teaching?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:29.120
 Dokti teaching or the Mahadhi teaching, I'm using those three terminologies. Mahadhi teaching,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:36.960
 Dokti teaching, ninth yana teaching, that teaching who is giving Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.520
 Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya Buddha gave these Dokti teachings.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:53.840
 Teachings and where he gave these teachings? He gave the teachings not in this duality world,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:00.880
 world duality, he gave this teaching in the world that which is beyond the dualities,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:10.240
 realm of beyond the dualities. Buddha gave these teachings. To whom he gave the teaching? He gave

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:18.080
 the teachings but those those who receive the teaching is there also no other than the really

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.040
 Buddha Dharmakaya himself. They have similar realization. Similar realization, similar

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:31.040
 understanding is known as Auchan like Western Ratnus. Auchan like Western Ratnus of Buddhas.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:41.600
 So teacher is Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya and the place is a realm of the beyond the dualities.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:50.720
 Ratnus or receiver are all human love of the Western Ratnus,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:02.320
 Muslim or assemblies. They have similar realization and how he transmitted mind to mind

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.360
 transmission

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.920
 mission lineage without warding, without vocabulary, without symbolics, he transmitted this Buddha.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:22.480
 And at what time? What time? Beyond the three times. Beyond the past, beyond the present,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:30.400
 and beyond the future. Beyond the three times Buddha transmitted this teaching. That teaching

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:38.640
 is teaching of Dhokti, Dhokti, Dhokti teaching. As Buddha transmitted that teaching through that

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:46.320
 as the mind to mind transmission lineages to this Auchan like Western Ratnus. Ratnus in the time

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:57.680
 beyond the three times. Times. Then and then how the second stage started. Second strategy is

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:03.920
 Sambhola transmission lineage. Sambhola transmission lineage. Sambhola transmission

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.680
 lineage started with the Dharmakaya Buddha of Sambhola Buddha. Dharmakaya Buddha of Sambhola

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:19.360
 Buddha. Still is a Dharmakaya state in general way, but within the Dharmakaya divide as three.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:27.280
 So Sambhola Buddha of Dharmakaya, such as the Buddha with dharas, dharas. They transmitted

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.800
 again similar realizations such as Ratnus of the five Dayana Buddhas. An Auchan like of the

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.680
 male and female realization beings, peace and wrath of duty. Buddhas appeared. They transmitted

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:51.200
 again beyond the world, but through just symbols. Symbols transmitted this teaching in such as

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:59.440
 including such a great master, master, garab dodya, so forth. There is these teachings that

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:07.200
 so transmitted. That's how this jocchi teaching started in the way, how that teaching came.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:16.640
 Now this, when this jocchi teaching came to this human world, that is around 28 years after

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:24.240
 Buddha Shakyamuni's Mahaparinarana, then this teaching, jocchi teaching appeared in this human

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:32.080
 world. And that is generally, Buddha Shakyamuni also told before his Mahaparinarana, he told

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:40.000
 this sacred teaching will come in the future when the time is ready. There is known as bodhisattva,

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:49.040
 bodhisattva, kundaransa. He rose up, when Buddha announced his Mahaparinarana, he rose up from the

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:55.360
 audience or the guru, a student. And all great teacher, you give lot of teachings of the causal

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.640
 jana teachings, teachings that to be practiced and meditated that, but when you are going to tell

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:10.080
 that teaching that don't have to make big effort and reach enlightenment, so easy. When you give

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:17.520
 that sacred teachings and Buddha said, yes, I did that, I did that, but that teaching that don't

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.680
 have

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.800
 to rely too much effort and hard to get easily get enlightened, that teaching will come very soon

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:33.120
 after my Mahaparinarana. As Buddha said that, then as he said, 28 years after Buddha Shakyamuni's

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:41.920
 Mahaparinarana, then teaching start coming all the sacred teachings. And particularly Zokki

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.400
 teaching

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.760
 also then came around that time. That time, who bought this Zokki teaching to the human world?

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.760
 It's known as the Buddha Shakyamuni in the form of Dharmakaya to give already that teaching. But

00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.000
 who bought this teaching on the human world is known as the famous Zokki master, Garab Dorji.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.800
 Garab Dorji bought this Zokki teaching this to human world. And Garab Dorji was born in

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:16.960
 west India, known as Odhyanas. He was born, born as a very miraculous, beautiful bird. And when he

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.080
 was young, and then he began to, he was already like emanate on the radio, but then he began to

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:30.320
 perceive so many certain teachings and in bone was to shine completely, understand beautifully

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.520
 everything. And then he received the teaching entirely, Zokki teaching from Vaidya Sattva,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:43.360
 Buddha Vaidya Sattva, and as well as Buddha Vaidya Pani and so forth. All Zokki teachings he

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.320
 received.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.120
 So that is like, all Zokki teaching came in that time. So around 28 years after the

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.680
 Buddha Shakyamuni Mahaparri Nirvana, Garab Dorji master, Garab Dorji bought this Zokki teaching

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.240
 to this human world. And that is really history of Zokki teaching how it came to this world.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.200
 And particularly this teaching, this time that I'm focused on this teaching,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:16.240
 teaching is then among the Zokki teaching can be divided into three sections. Those are known

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:23.600
 as the mind to mind, sorry, mind sections, sections, Zokkins, space sections, Zokki teachings,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.040
 and pit and structure sections of the Zokki teachings. So three different

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:39.600
 sections of Zokki teaching. This teaching is very much connected as

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.880
 mind sections of Zokki teaching. So that is what the brief kind of overview of the teaching. And

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.440
 now I'll go to the text itself. I think many of you have already this is translated into English.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.440
 Maybe you have that, but I will go on this text. And now I will go with the titles. And this text

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:06.480
 can be divided into three kind of principal groups. And the title, principal part of the teachings,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.320
 and the concluding part of the teaching as a colophonous. So, and who wrote this teaching?

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:20.080
 It's the great Zokkin master, and also known as Garab Dourgi of Tibet, and the very famous Zokki

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.720
 master known as Long Chimpa. Long Chimpa was the one of the great Zokki masters in the Zokki,

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.160
 or the history of the Zokkin. So other Tibetan Buddhism. And he was a Tibetan. He was born

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.000
 around 13th century or 14th centuries. And his name was Long Chimpa. And he was one of the great

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.320
 scholars too, intellectual scholars. He understood all the five different sciences in the Tibetan

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:51.520
 use study. Those are known as science of mind, science of the healing, science of art,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.920
 science of language, science of logic, and the reasoning thing. So he really understood everything.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:05.520
 His master of all that, that, and he was also created by the Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurapaya

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.520
 Masambhava as the greatest, greatest master. Master, as is predicted, he was born in the center

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:18.240
 of Tibet, as I said, around the 13th or 14th centuries. And that, and then he became the one

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:25.360
 of the great masters of Zokkins, all times, times. And every great master used to call him

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.960
 Second Gaurab Durya, or Gaurab Durya of Tibet. So he, this is his teachings, this teaching,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:37.920
 he instructed this Zokki teaching from the Zokkin Tantras. And then this is what his teaching.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:45.200
 So the title of this teaching is, what did he say? The evairap, the task letters, the dual shape,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:53.680
 dual shape of pit and stockings of the dual shape that a king of creation of both each other.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:00.720
 That is the title of these teachings. Now, so we say that, what is this? In the Tibet, I read that

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:09.760
 Sanchapasen, Sanchapasen means bodhicata, kumji yarpo is a king of all creation, all, all, all,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:19.040
 maybe king of all creating, creating all, and tantri is a priest, instruction, and the title is

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.800
 dual shapes. And if we go a little bit kind of like roughly these meanings, if I go that,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:33.200
 what means, what means that? Bodhicata. Bodhicata, I already mentioned, you know already that,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:40.400
 but bodhicata can be divided into two, known as relative to the bodhicata and absolute to the

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:47.200
 bodhicata. Relative to the bodhicata, absolute bodhicata. Relative to bodhicata is as we've been

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.840
 discussing, loving kindness and compassion. Compassion, kindness, thought for all sentient beings,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.120
 and like to bring them joy, peace, happiness, for that very reason, I like to become the Buddha.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.680
 I like to discover my own true nature so that I can benefit for all living beings. That is the

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.840
 principle meaning of the relative true bodhicata. If we go little details of the bodhicata, what

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.160
 this

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.560
 is known as then can be divided into two. Wishing bodhicata, actualizing bodhicata.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:25.200
 Wishing bodhicata means intention. You develop the intention. Best upon love and kindness,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.200
 compassion, very beautiful compassion, uncondition, unconditioned compassion, developed. How you

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.600
 develop the black compassion, how you develop what? You develop known as poor immeasurables.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.280
 Many of you know that, poor immeasurable. Immeasurable of loving kindness, immeasurable

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:51.200
 of compassion, immeasurable of joy and resources, immeasurable economies. Develop that in heart,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:58.880
 really strongly, immensely beautiful, profound, unconditioned. Love for all living beings.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.560
 Why is it immeasurable? Because our love and compassion, this bodhicata is not just

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:11.440
 designated areas, partialities. We like to develop that all living beings, living beings are

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.600
 immeasurable, cannot measure. According to the Buddha's teaching, as far as space goes,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:26.960
 space goes, that far living being exists. As far as many that living being exists,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:34.560
 that much everyone has karma and emotions. As long as they have karma and emotions,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:40.880
 that long they have challenge, difficulty troubles. That much that we are going to

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:49.040
 develop the bodhicata. Love that much, therefore said immeasurable loves, loving kindness,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:57.920
 immeasurable compassion, immeasurable joy and resources, immeasurable economies. When you

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:05.200
 have that sincerely in our heart, mind, and praying for that, wishing for that, what is

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:13.760
 known as wishing bodhicata. Wishing bodhicata. You really wish that to every living being.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.320
 What actually means bodhicata is Sanskrit word, you know that. Bodhi means enlightenment.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:28.400
 Jetta means mind or awareness or our intelligence, the intelligence of the enlightenment.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:37.440
 Awareness of enlightenment, mind of enlightenment. That is the word, enlightenment. What is that

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.520
 mind of enlightenment? I've been discussing this. These four immigrables are enlightenment,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.040
 they're not just a regular kind of ordinary things. When you have the true love in your,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:55.200
 our heart, your heart, in my heart, we have the enlightenment. Enlightenment is shiny at that time.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:03.600
 Enlightenment, the Buddhahood is shining. When you have the true comparison in our heart and mind,

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:13.200
 enlightenment is shining. And we have the joy, the rejoice in our heart, the enlightenment glowing.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:23.440
 When you have the great economies, enlightenment is shining and glowing and strong and pervasive

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:31.680
 in our heart. So it's not just regular. It's so spiritual, but yet it's so simple. It's basic

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.840
 nature of yours and mine is nothing extraordinary that we have. It's our nature. We're touching,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.040
 when we have, we touch that, we're touching to our heart. We are touching to our home best,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:51.040
 sweet home, sweet home. True, that is what it is. That is, you're really exploring your goodness.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.680
 When you have love and compassion and kindness for boneless, what emotions are we releasing?

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.960
 Unnecessary things, anger, jealous, hate report, ignorance, attachment. Those are by saying

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.600
 something really goodbye. Goodbye. We're really saying that. They are unnatural. They are trouble

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 makers. They make trouble to us according to the Buddha's teaching from the beginning of this time

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:24.400
 until now. They're continually making trouble. It will continually make troubles. They're the very

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:33.120
 cause of our karmas, bad karmas. Karmas, we're removing that. Enlightenment is shining in our

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.720
 heart. Yet, again, as I said, yet is so simple. It's nothing extraordinary that we don't have.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.960
 We're just touching to our best. It's our ordinary, our best, our right, our goodness,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:55.040
 our quality, our inner trigger. Trigger, they're really touching to our best. That is known as

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:02.240
 wishing both each other. When we practice wishing both each other, how we do, we put that into

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.640
 training. Training, those training as known as instability, many of you know those are known as

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:17.040
 tungli practices, exchanging practices. Those are wishing practices you're putting in action. Not

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.520
 just wishing that beautiful thought attitude, but something you put in action. That's known as

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:32.570
 training of the wishing both each other. So special and so beautiful, so powerful, and also so

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.120
 healing.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:42.320
 Healing is with healthy emotions, scars, negatives, obscurations, all the anxiety, past memories,

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.600
 all that, really it will kill. It brings completely rejuvenating ourself,

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:57.040
 completely new levels of the beautiful qualities. Therefore, it is so special. It's our nature,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:03.280
 your good qualities, your good nature. It's not something that something only Buddha has or some

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.920
 some selected guru has that. It's all living being has these qualities. So this is known as

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:18.480
 wishing both each other. When you put that action more physically, that is known as actualizing

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.600
 both each other, and I'm sure many of you know that, actualizing both each other. Actualizing

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.400
 both each other, how we put this. Actualizing both each other, that wishing both each other, you

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.640
 put

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:37.520
 that in actualizing, put action, action by the physical verbally. This is verbally physical.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:44.880
 How? Through six parameters, six parameters, six parameters, such as generous parameter,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:53.840
 morality parameter, and patient parameters, parameters, and joyful effort parameter,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:02.720
 concentration in western parameters. Best upon wishing that poor boundless. Generous parameter

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:10.730
 is best upon poor boundless of this wishing both each other, and morality is best upon poor bound

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.200
less,

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:19.600
 and patient is best on poor boundless. Every six parameters is best upon poor boundless,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.800
 or again I'm using different kind of term, poor boundless, or the immeasurable.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:32.720
 Immeasurable, poor, immeasurable. Best upon that. Therefore, it's called actualizing both

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:39.600
 each other. Actualizing both each other, you put according your capabilities. Your capabilities,

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:47.760
 readiness of others, and do with capability, but we do with joy, do with courage and commitment.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:55.280
 You would do with rejoice and joy. Joy. That is really about the relative both each other.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.160
 Now, absolute true both each other. What is absolute true both each other? Absolute true

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:06.320
 both each other is zoky teaching. It's absolute both each other. This whole teaching what we're

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.000
 going to explain or going through is basically on the absolute both each other. Absolute both each

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.720
 other is similar as if we use the great emptiness, the great Pandya Paramata. Pandya Paramata

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.200
 practice,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.560
 zoky practices, Mahamudra practices, Mademaka practice, or Zazen practices. Those are known

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:33.920
 as absolute true both each others. Actualizing that realization without any grasping and clinging

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:42.320
 and focus, relax on the natural state, exactly as it is open, unimpeded, beyond all the consumption

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:42.320
,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:50.800
 the duality, and the aspect, all free from state, inconceivable, inexpressible, and unborn,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.880
 unceasing as in the teaching state. Relaxing that natural state is known as absolute true

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:04.320
 both each other, which is discomfort. That is really about the both each other. The king of

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.040
 creations

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:16.960
 is the synonym of the mind. The synonym of the mind. Our mind is the creator of everything.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:25.440
 Your mind is your creator of everything, every environment of you. My mind is the creator of

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.960
 all in my environment. Everything, everything, perception, consumption, aggregates, everything

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.240
 according to the Buddha teaching, and there's what is called five aggregates, form, aggregate,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.080
 perception, feeling, aggregate, perception, consumption, conscience, all that aggregates

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.720
 are created and reflected from our mind. Therefore, it is mind is the creator of everything.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:57.760
 And our happiness, our joy and peace, and our difficulty challenge, the suffering, the sadness,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:04.800
 all that is controlled and created and propagated, maintained by the mind. Therefore, it is named

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.280
 as

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:12.000
 king of creations, king of creations. Nirvana is created by this, samsara is created by this,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.200
 this, there is nothing else in that. Every environment is display of this mind,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.240
 mind. So therefore, this is called king of creations. And then this is also known as

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:33.360
 all very famous teaching of the Doki teaching known as kubzi-yabu. So this kubzi-yabu teaching

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:39.440
 is king of creation, tantal. From there, great master, lunki-pa kind of taught the essence,

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.400
 adopted, and this, so it's essence of that teaching. And then, taunti is a bit instruction,

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.560
 so kubzi-yabu is explaining step by step how to practice this meditation, practice.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:59.120
 And that is like jewel ship, is a metaphor named because it's jewel ship, ship that will cross the

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:06.160
 ocean of the samsara or ocean of dualities. It will cross the duality, publication, where we are

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:13.840
 crossing that, crossing the duality. Ocean also is comfortable as a jewel ship is just every,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.920
 every facility, every lucky to call it, so it's not just hard here, we are crossing that

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:28.400
 ocean of duality, but with calm, comfortable, uplifting, encouragement, and fulfillment,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.880
 advancing, rewarding each time that, so it's really just like jewel, filled with old,

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:40.480
 luxurious items in which you perform a jewel ship, that we are crossing that.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.000
 So that is a brilliant title of this teaching, but title is very important in Buddhism teaching,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.280
 so the title will give the essence meaning of the entire teaching, so therefore we are in a way

00:38:53.280 --> 00:39:01.360
 capturing the essence meaning of the entirely this teaching, so that is really on that teaching.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:16.240
 And now we go to the text itself, self and it's now, sorry, I just, it may be need.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:44.000
 Sorry. Oh, I have to prepare myself now. I think so. We do the preparations,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.240
 then can't go far, so I think I should.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:09.360
 Okay, now this teaching, how this teaching begins, it begins with again, the homage,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:17.200
 this is the (speaks in foreign language) homage, and then he is promising, he's kind of announcing

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:26.560
 that I'm going to share you the essence meaning of the (speaks in foreign language)

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:35.920
 so there's one word is paying homage, and then second is words is explaining that I will

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.960
 tell you complete this meaning, meaning of the (speaks in foreign language)

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.920
 so that is what is paying homage to the Dharmakaya Buddha, the one, the teacher,

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:54.400
 great teacher who taught this teaching, Dharmakaya Buddha, I said Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:01.120
 and that Buddha is what is known as some of the Buddhas, some of the Buddhas, so paying that pay

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.280
 homage to that great Buddhist Buddhas, and that Buddha is what? He said I just roughly don't

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:18.320
 read this, it's translated that, and pure from the beginning and peaceful and pervasive,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:30.080
 uncompounded is the union of the emptiness and a greater wisdom, greater wisdom beyond of the

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:37.360
 existing and non-existing pervasive, there's no partiality of the different directions,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:45.760
 so such as poor directions of and poor cardinal directions, and the pervasive without the changing

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:53.840
 and unchanging, who is that? That is known as the ordinal Buddha, Buddha, great king of creations,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:42:04.720
 to you I pay homage, that is a really meaning of this homage. The next one is that his is a

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.440
 commitment that is explaining that I will teach you or essence the meaning of this long kimbhas,

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:19.520
 again great mass of kimbhas, and he said the essence of every phenomenon, essence of everything

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:30.720
 is your mind or my mind, essence of everything is the nature of the mind, to discovering directly

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:38.640
 nature of the mind in the direct perception, when you discover the nature of the mind in the direct

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:47.760
 perception, direct perceptions, there's nothing to go when we say advancing the teaching, advancing

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:58.480
 the stages, there's really nothing to advance, then except abiding and perceiving, relax on that

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:08.240
 nature of the mind as you proceed directly, it is again, it is enlightened nature, isn't Buddha is

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:16.080
 right with you, when you discover this nature of the mind beyond the any publications, perceiving

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:24.640
 exactly as it is, that is Buddha, that means that is Buddha is embodiment of loving kindness

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.440
 and compassion, worship them, free from any duality publications, you're perceiving that,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:40.160
 that Buddha is right with you, with you and right with everyone, when you see that nature of the

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:48.720
 mind, that is Buddha, that Buddha, that nature of the mind as everything is completed, says all the

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.880
 written scholars, when we think about the Buddha, what we say the Buddha is totally enlightened,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:01.280
 Buddha has this power, that power, that realization, this and that, that all is right with you,

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:10.560
 when you discover the nature of the mind, it's not coming from outside, newly kind of joined with

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:18.560
 your nature or the enlightenment, it's right here, right here, right with you, right with you,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:27.200
 that one teaching that tells exactly as it is, that it is, that is the highest teachings,

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:34.320
 that's the highest teaching, that teaching is known as king of creation, Nokumzi Japut Dantara.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.720
 Dantara, that teaching I will hear, Nokima said, that I will bring that as like,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:47.600
 like just you can follow easily one after another to the purpose of those proper who are future,

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:54.320
 who are interested, like to discover their own nature, for that I will tell for them how to do

00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:02.640
 that. So that is what Nokima said that I will tell, I will finish these teachings. So that is known

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:02.880
 as

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:10.560
 like, paying homage and then reactivating his commitment to bring essence of these teachings.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:18.560
 Now, then what how this teach that started, that there is this Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.320
 Buddha for example, Buddha Shakyamuni is totally enlightened beings, full of kindness and

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:31.200
 compassion for all living beings without any exceptions, and also same time he is so kind

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:38.240
 and considerable and a full of skillful means, skillful means and kindness and compassion,

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.160
 skillful means and thoughtful and very concerning of the everyone's, their readiness and their

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.800
 capabilities or how they can do it. And because of that, Buddhagi,

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:57.760
 Buddhagi variety of the teachings, as I said Nainana teachings, Nain, all those different Nainana

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.680
 teachers, including Athiova or Nainana teaching, these teachings, he gave these teachings according

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.880
 to those individual's capabilities. Plus he gave the teachings. But the highest teaching is these

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:18.080
 Dokki teachings. All other teachings that you compare with Dokki teaching or this Nainana teaching,

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:24.720
 all other teachings still not completed, not completed, because says the Buddha give the

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.080
 according to readiness, the capabilities of the individual is in their readiness, so it's not

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:36.640
 really any completed, keep the teaching. So therefore, what many great masters use it,

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:43.600
 all the teachings are lined up exactly as a staircase, staircase, staircase has, for example,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:51.680
 nine staircases, nine staircases, everything is connected. The first staircase is so important to

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:57.840
 the second staircase, second and first is so important, third staircase, third staircase is

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:04.640
 so important and fourth and fifth, but this third and fourth staircase is not reaching to the

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.040
 second

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:11.760
 floor, it won't reach the second floor, but yet is so important. Without that, it won't go up,

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:19.720
 therefore it's so important, yet is not important. So therefore, this Athi Vyana teaching is like

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:19.760
 at

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:25.040
 the staircase, but it's not still complete that they will reach to the second floor. For example,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:32.240
 that I'm using the examples. The ninth staircase, we have that, then you will easily reach to the

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:39.280
 second floor. Similar this Nainana teaching, the Athi Vyana teaching, this teaching is a direct

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.000
 teaching to true nature of our own, your own natural qualities, how to perceive that,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.600
 how to discover that, natural, without any kind of like detours or without any kind of like

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.000
 different

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 ways, it's directly teaching that. For the third reason and the king of Craig and Dattanta kind

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.320
 of glorifying the importance of this, this, this teachings, Nainana or the Dokki teaching sets.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.400
 And here what this is in the teaching set, set, all those different teachings are taught by the

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.560
 three different Buddhas, but yet they are still kind of like interpretable meaning teachings,

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:28.000
 that still can interpret it, that. So it's not really the final teachings, but this teaching,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.920
 the Nainana teaching is ultimate teaching, direct teaching, most simple teaching, and for easy

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:42.080
 teaching, it just has nothing to be really kind of like, oh what any, it's just direct, direct,

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.760
 negative teaching, negative teaching, for that reason, this is the highest teaching. So that is

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:56.080
 really of this, how the teaching is so important, this teaching is. And then there's a similar

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:03.120
 statement that goes on here, so I won't go this, because it just will take more time, but that is

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:14.240
 the essence of these teachings. One, excuse me, what is the time now? At 48, or at 48, maybe then

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:21.360
 I will stop here, okay, then I will do continuity tomorrow, so I will try to stop, because at 48,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:42.800
 maybe, or maybe I'll talk a little bit, yeah, maybe. So therefore this teaching, the Nainana

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:50.240
 teaching is ultimate teachings, teachings I said so many times, all the other teachings

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:59.680
 are that at Nainana teaching, at Nainana teachings, still I say the interpretable, interpretable

00:49:59.680 --> 00:49:59.920
 means

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:10.400
 what? Still it has some other meanings, it's not completely final, that is the ninth is the final,

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:16.080
 there's nothing to interpret it, it's a direct teachings, therefore it is ultimate teaching,

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:24.480
 teachings, teachings. And now, so therefore that is really about how teaching is so precious,

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:32.560
 this teaching, teacher who give this teaching is the Dharmakaya Buddha of Dharmakaya Buddhas.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:41.840
 Within the Dharmakaya Buddha, Dharmakaya Buddha is a, three Buddhas, Dharmakaya, Sambokaya,

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:49.440
 Narmakaya, Dharmakaya Buddha is considering the absolute Buddhas. This absolute Buddha

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:57.360
 is divided into three Buddhas, as I said Dharmakaya of Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya of Sambokaya,

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:04.640
 Dharmakaya of Narmakaya, so three Buddhas, this teaching is taught by Dharmakaya Buddha of

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:14.560
 Dharmakaya. The teacher is the absolute ordinal, the ordinal teacher, teaching is the ultimate

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:23.040
 teacher, teaching, teaching because it has exactly the nature of the mind,

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:31.680
 exactly as it is. The nature of the mind, as Loon Kippa mentioned, I said, is already enlightened.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:38.800
 Your nature of the mind, my nature of the mind, everyone's nature of the mind is totally

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:48.320
 enlightenings, total enlightenings. Why then is we are not enlightened? That is then in the

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:48.720
 teaching

00:51:48.720 --> 00:52:00.720
 is because of the dualities. Duality is blocking of our nature. Duality is like ever used example

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:10.800
 as the cataracts, cataracts. The cataracts is blocking the vision, view of the realities

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:17.760
 and the duality, cataract duality is what? Therefore it's called the obscurations.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:27.040
 It's blockage, obscurations is when it's not connected with nature. It's like clothes in the

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:35.600
 sky and when the clothes is the sky, overcasted the sky, what it does? It blocks the building in

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:44.160
 the color of the blue sky and the sun and the moon and the stars. But clothes is not the nature

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:51.200
 of the sky. Clothes is temporarily, arises circumstances, through the circumstances,

00:52:51.200 --> 00:53:01.520
 it arises. It arises, it is not permanent, it's going to finish. You can change. Similarly,

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:08.800
 duality is not natural, not natural. It's temporary, it's created, it's propagated.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:16.240
 For that reason the Buddha teaching what he said, delusions, it's deluded, delusion created. This

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:24.080
 came like by this delusion and it is here now, it's blocking the image but it's something that

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:32.000
 we can remove, we can change, we can remove. When it's removed, that nature of the mind, your mind,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.360
 my mind, everything, is totally enlightened. And enlightened, exactly the same as the Buddha

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:45.040
 shaktamari, Gaurapayama sambhava, Gaurapayama sambhava, Gaurapdoor jai, all the sammana bhatras,

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:51.840
 whatever example he used, male Buddha, female Buddha, exactly the same, same. That technique,

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:58.000
 how to do this practice, how to revert that nature and remove that duality, that characteristic

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.040
 duality,

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:07.600
 that tells by this teaching, this teaching how to do that. Teaching, that is what this teaching,

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:14.560
 this is very special, it is important, it is vast, this ultimate, this direct teaching,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:22.160
 that is what I explained. Now that is really meaning of this importance with teachings that

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:32.640
 now how, now in order to talk this teaching, teaching then Unchiba again made three

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:39.680
 highlighted. What are those three highlighted? The teacher, one who's going to talk this teaching,

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.080
 the student one who's going to receive this teaching, and how they should then, after that,

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:53.840
 how they can do practices. So that means going to talk about the teacher, what qualification of the

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:59.840
 teacher should be, what audience or the practice, practicing how they should be, how they really

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:08.960
 prepare themselves to be as, to handle like these teachings, teachings, and then when they're both

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:15.120
 kind of quite good, how they should practice now, that is the great master of Unchiba is going to

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:20.960
 lay out, exactly at ease, and the first is going to tell about the teachers, teachers.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:30.160
 Teachers should be this way, one who understanding the meaning of the Buddhism and non-Buddhisms,

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.720
 kind of clearly understand it, and within the Buddhism also understanding

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:41.600
 some degree of all those at Jana's teachings. See the distinctions between each Jana, this,

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:47.680
 and what, and this, and that, and why this Dokki teaching is so special. So kind of see that also,

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:54.480
 clearly understand that, and the knowledge level. So that means, as I said early in the Buddhism,

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:01.440
 say the three wisdom, wisdom that comes from the studying, wisdom that comes from connotations,

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:06.720
 wisdom that comes from the meditation and the practices. So teacher, one who should have

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:14.320
 those three wisdoms, started wisdom, contemplation wisdom, and meditated and practice the wisdoms,

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:23.120
 wisdoms, and according wisdom levels, wisdom levels, and then same time, teacher, one is also

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.720
 kind and compassion. Kindness, compassion fills the heart with love and compassion,

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:34.160
 all simple, both each other, as we discussed, related to the both each other and absolutely

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:41.280
 through the both each other, and the gentle, peaceful, humble, and simple, simple, and what

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:48.160
 teacher talking is also practicing. That teacher is practicing that teaching, not just a talker,

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.600
 lecturer, but also the practitioner, the one who practices that teaching, teaching,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.960
 teachings that, teaching that, and particularly have the understanding and understanding of the

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:07.520
 meaning of the Doki teachings, Doki teaching in the practice and realize it, and in lineage

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.710
 instructions or lineage blessings. This Doki teaching, as the lunkimba is explaining later here too

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.000
,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.520
 this teaching is the lineage teachings, teaching that is not just developed overnight or few years

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:25.280
 ago, but this is the long-lasting running like Mississippi River, that from the ancient time

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:31.360
 of the olden time, without the broken, without the looted, and the preserved, exactly as the

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.960
 start of the time of the Garab Doji to this human world, maintained and preserved with their full

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.120
 of

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:43.310
 love and joy and devotion and courage and commitment, kicked close to their heart as their heart,

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:43.440
 as

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:48.560
 their breathing, as their breathing is really preserved, honored with that, and preserved

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:53.920
 actualized that realization, and here to the next day, and that's how the teaching continued.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:58:01.360
 As we said, the Buddha Shakyamuni came to this world 2,600 years ago, but teaching is continued,

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:09.440
 and that means all the practices kept preserved, exactly clever, call it, power, nutritious, or the

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:17.200
 meaning, essence, really they kept, until now, kept, and how they kept, not with anger, not with

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:22.960
 jealous, not with violence, not with the kind of I'm better than you, your walls, I'm great,

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:30.080
 this and that way, but humble, simple, kindness, compassion, joy, and appreciation, Shakyamuni,

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:37.920
 and devotion, and with treasures, and practice, mature themselves, glory, glory themselves,

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:44.880
 and help to them, glory others. It's kind of like running like Olympic torch, light continue,

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:51.280
 one after another, it brighten, lighten up there with joy, and fulfillment, and faster next, next

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:57.760
 stages, and continually there, for, for there, and faster, next, next, this, this lineage, so

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.400
 therefore

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:05.360
 have the lineage, blessings, all that, and it makes sense, that, and also, so that, and,

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:12.560
 and then also, when teacher, teach to that, also with kind, kind of meaning, explaining that nice,

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:18.940
 and beautiful, according with their, kind of their understandable meaning, with explaining that,

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.280
 and

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:26.000
 kind of understanding, and then also not kind of like caught by the worldly efforts, worldly fame,

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.840
 reputation, greed, this and that things, kind of concerning with the world things, and greedy,

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.360
 and obsessed with all the, the world material things, kind of like that, that is not the teacher,

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:42.560
 teachers, those who are kind of with more, more simple, and more line of the, exactly,

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.520
 Buddha Shakyamuni, when you, I mean, even not exactly that, but as much as the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:53.760
 so all those great Arhatas, great those masters, that as that, those are known as they, who had

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:59.610
 those qualities, are known as qualified, qualified teachers, so those are the qualifications of the

00:59:59.610 --> 00:59:59.760
,

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:09.360
 of the teachers, teachers, and then teaching, a student, who also has a similar thought,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:17.200
 full of them, the student also has, so also, kind of, students are honest, also very, kind of,

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.480
 compassionate, kindness, they like to explore their meaning of lives, and lives also like to

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:28.000
 help to the other beings, also some courage, and commitment, the confidence, teaching that is not

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.120
 just a kind of like, as a resilient and neglected, that someday they're going on, and appreciate,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.640
 it really put that somebody on the, on their, their practices, or some review of their effort

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.320
 to put that, and with full of joy, and devotion, courage, and kindness, also both each other,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.040
 as we discussed, that, that related to both each other, to give somebody the kindness,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:57.280
 a compared thought, thought, and, and also have kind of, also joy, and joy, and lot of courage, and

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.280
 confidence to the practice, those are known as qualification, the teachers, the students, and then

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:10.960
 this, this is teaching, so those are known as qualified, qualified teacher, and qualified

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:17.840
 students, students, students, and they are also, what in the teaching said here, that said, who has

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:26.080
 also devotion, and who keep also smile, or the kind of, counter the level, also really beautiful,

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:32.640
 great joyful effort, and great compassion, and also the joys, and some degree of also not too

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.080
 much, kind of, attractive to all the material things, all things, more material things,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.320
 and less arrogance, more respect to the teacher, and to the sangha members, friends, and always

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:44.560
 kind

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:52.400
 of honor the teachings, teachings, and have some commitment to do practices, and those are really

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.480
 essence, like as said here, say the qualification of the students, so that is the word, like really

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.960
 about the qualification of the teacher, and the qualification of the student, and then I'm going

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.760
 to stop here, if you have some questions, I'm happy to discuss it for a few minutes, and then

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.320
 otherwise

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:18.720
 we'll do short meditation, and dedicate the marriage.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:33.040
 Anyone?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.720
 Yes, please.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:50.160
 Stairs, the staircases, so other practices, what you're saying with the Mahayana,

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:56.960
 within the Mahayana tradition, will be like up there, but not to the second floor,

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:16.160
 and so the, um, I've heard this word before, and it's a difficult word for me.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:31.920
 What?

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.720
 Yes, I've said nine yana, nine, number nine, number nine, sorry,

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:46.880
 yana is a Sanskrit word, Sanskrit word, yana means weekal, weekal, ninth level weekal,

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:57.120
 it's weekal, weekal, okay, so then what did you say, Mahayana? You said something about Mahayana.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:06.320
 This is old, the old tradition, right? Which one?

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:14.080
 Of course, the old teaching is the same time, same time from the

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.400
 Buddha's time, so it's definitely the old in that level, and Dzokin is of course old teaching,

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.600
 and Dzokin teaching said it's not just Dzokin teaching, it only came with this human world in

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.560
 the two thousand six hundred years ago, but Dzokin's teaching is happening in the celestial realms,

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:44.000
 rams all the time, okay, so when you say ninth yana, is that compared to something, there's a lot

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.160
 of

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:52.720
 grounds and paths and things, is that aligned with those? Growned in path, yeah, there's definitely

01:04:52.720 --> 01:05:00.400
 ground, and this definitely Dzokin is also has ground and path, but, but Dzokin, yes, what's he?

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:10.880
 Is that, is that, is that relevant to Dzokin? Yeah, it is relevant, but it is Dzokin level,

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:21.280
 ground yana is the same thing as other yanas, but Dzokin is so fast, so fast, so fast, so fast,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:34.560
 F-A-S-T, I think, so fast, F-A-S-T, no, past, no, Dzokin is so fast, Dzokin is so fast,

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:42.560
 as we take examples, every going to walk to the, from here to the east coast, every going to go to

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:51.840
 the east coast, there's how many different methods, going walking, walking, walking, and it still

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.160
 will

01:05:52.160 --> 01:06:01.600
 go, you will reach this coast, then there is riding horse, and you will get this coast, then there

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:01.840
 is,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:10.400
 this what's called, this train of course, all you will reach too, and motor car will reach,

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:20.320
 and then you will go by what? Go by with, with the plane, plane, aeroplane, you will get,

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.800
 and if you go by, Bremen aeroplane, maybe past, I don't know, I don't know, and then if you go to

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:33.760
 the Concord, Concord, you will go, and of course it's not existing now, if you go space shuttle,

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:42.560
 no, I think it will take, and maybe in the future will develop, you can go through a

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:50.400
 text machine, text, in the future, I'm talking future, future stay, and just one instant,

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:58.240
 or you, you will be, you will be, what I call, I mean we will, we will be scanned through the scan,

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:06.400
 boom, and that is like Dzokin, even though it went all that, I mean it just went there,

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:14.080
 all this distance, it went through, through, from Portland, to Idaho, and then Wyoming, Colorado,

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.600
 and whatever, and then the Mid East, and then it's really, but it went so fast, it's just,

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:28.240
 so you really don't have to count so many those, path and ground, that is like Dzokin, so instant.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:43.280
 Of course, you want to realize Dharmakaya, but that is not the big realization, it is

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.440
 Samodhakaya, because that's where all the communication happens, is that it?

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.880
 Say that again, no, no, say that again, I keep in here, no, no, the police, please.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:04.560
 I think I understand, to have been told, that in Vajrayana Tantrayana, they say that,

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:13.840
 of course, you want to understand or experience Dharmakaya, but that the big thing,

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:20.960
 big realization, is actually the Samodhakaya, because of the symbolism,

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.720
 that's where the communication happens. Who said that?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:43.520
 But I shall tell them when I say it, they say who they are. No, no, I think so,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.880
 I never heard that, I'm not just joking. I'm pretty sure I heard this at the college in town, okay?

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.760
 No, I never heard that, I don't think it's true, when you, when you, when you reach Dharmakaya

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.320
 status, you reach Dharmakaya, when you reach Dharmakaya, what's called, in the general Buddhist

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:09.120
 terminology, there is called tukayas, tukayas, you heard right, tukayas, two rupakayas, rupak,

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:16.960
 Dharmakaya and rupakayas, tukayas, and what is rupakaya? When you achieve the Dharmakaya,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:25.360
 then you instantly achieve the rupakayas, and the rupakaya is what? Sambokaya and the namakayas,

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.280
 and in order to achieve that realization, what do you do during the generally Buddhist

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:39.200
 terminology, or is it okay too? And you do two accumulation merits, two merits, what's the merit

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.120
 in accumulation merits? And by the power of the, of course they are all connected, it's not really

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.400
 completely different from each other. By the power of the merit, what's the merit? You achieve the

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:58.240
 Dharmakaya, and the power of the accumulation merit, you achieve the rupakaya. With all the

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.480
 accumulating, completely two, two accumulation, you will not going to achieve the enlightenment

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.360
 in general, in the Buddhist teaching. And so therefore, in order to reach the Dharmakaya,

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:19.440
 you already reached the Dharmakaya. For that reason, the great master, future Buddha, Maitriya,

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.960
 Maitriya gave the teaching known as five treatise, five treatise, one of the treatises known as the

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.040
 Pandya Paramata treatise, the ornament of the Pandya Paramata. They're teaching what Maitriya says.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:41.200
 When you reach the Dharmakaya status, without moving or without moving from Dharmakaya status,

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:49.760
 you emanate instantly two kyas, such as rupakaya and the narmakaya. Without moving the rupakaya,

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:57.120
 sambhokaya, you again emanate this narmakaya, and in the narmakaya level you perform 12

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:04.190
 prans for deeds, such as the Buddha Kya Kya Mani performed. So Buddha Kya Kya Mani, according Mahay

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:04.560
ana,

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:11.120
 according Vayayana, when Buddha Kya Kya Mani reached, when Buddha Kya Kya Mani was born,

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:17.360
 in India, that time, already he is enlightened. And this is a narmakaya Buddha.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:28.000
 Narmakaya, so therefore, I mean, I never heard any Buddhism teaching that you're reaching the

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.330
 Dharmakaya, sambhokaya hood, and not Dharmakaya hood, and that is really, I mean, wrong inform

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:34.720
ations.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:44.560
 You do experience Dharmakaya, but the important part is that, is of the sambhokakaya, and if,

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.640
 I think this might be tied to, I mean, you've heard this, I'm sure, I don't know, that there's

01:11:50.640 --> 01:12:00.400
 a concern about reaching direct perception too soon, such that you haven't accumulated enough

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:09.600
 merit, because I've heard it said that if you reach direct perception, you will not get.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:16.320
 So that means, if you reach very fast to New York, you're not, you, where you got, you got a New

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.560
 York

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:23.090
 program east coast, very fast, you didn't get enough, you didn't get through. You're not, you didn

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.520
't,

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:31.520
 you didn't got New York. I'm using east coast, I mean east coast. If you got fast to east coast,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.560
 you're not got east coast, because it didn't go too long enough. Because, but you didn't have time

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.120
 to gather merit. To get merit, that means, if you get Dharmakaya, if you got sambhokaya, that means

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.120
,

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:55.360
 you got, already got the merit, with the merit as like blink of eye, you utilize it. Therefore,

01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.960
 therefore, in the Doki teaching, it's very highly capable of the practitioners. So it's not like

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.440
 you have less compassion. No, no, the Doki teaching, the Doki practitioners, full of compassion,

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.000
 full,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.520
 when the sign of the realization is that it's measured by the compassion. So what is the thing

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.960
 about, something about the capability. What? I thought you said something on the first about,

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:28.320
 that each, that each of us would achieve, we have what we are already applying. What? That we are,

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:34.320
 in fact, already enlightened. Yeah. Okay, okay, we're like, we're in like nature, and that each

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:42.640
 will realize two degrees of their own capability. Is that right? That's true.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.700
 I feel like they agree with their own capability. Is there, are there some that are more

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:50.400
 enlightened

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.680
 than others then, or? Yeah, these are true. So some are unsurpassed, and some are not?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.720
 Yeah, some are very, some are very, that, that measure, why enlightened, not enlightened is

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:07.760
 measured, how much obscuration, the duality you removed. Some are really, very much, really good

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.280
 removed. They are very close to the enlightened. Some are not removed duality, then still they are

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.520
 heavy in the samsara. It's not measured by the nature of the mind, but it's measured by the,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:26.540
 of the duality, delusion, how, how much you. So if you became enlightened, you become enlightened,

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.120
 but still,

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.000
 and realize enlightenment, are you saying? What? Say that again. Question. Are you saying that you

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.600
 can become

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:45.040
 realized under enlightenment, direct perception, but still carry a duality that obscures your

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:53.040
 enlightenment more than other enlightenment? I don't understand. But I'm saying this,

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.400
 everyone has the same nature, the enlightened. According to Zoki level, I mean, it's already

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:07.040
 enlightened, you are enlightened, but duality is blocked. Duality, duality, yes. I get it, if they

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.680
're,

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:15.840
 if they're for everybody, until you are, until you remove it, and you see your own enlightenment.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.080
 Yeah,

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:22.400
 until you remove it, you will see, according to clothe in the sky, if it's a very heavy clothe,

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:28.320
 sunlight really become, here daylight become very dark, but if some kind of clothe the light now,

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:35.640
 according that sunlight began to shine, according that, so that is just a similar example. When

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.080
 your

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.200
 duality as much as you remove, the enlightenment shine. What is enlightenment? Enlightenment is

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.680
 versatile, enlightened with the computer, enlightenment low in kind, that is shining,

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.440
 you become more kind, more complete, more intelligent, more common sense, more, more,

01:15:51.440 --> 01:16:00.560
 more intelligent, more smart, that is the enlightenment. Okay, thank you, everyone.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.480
 Thank you, I hope you understand all these profound discussions.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:25.040
 With the short meditation, and then dedicate the marriage again.
