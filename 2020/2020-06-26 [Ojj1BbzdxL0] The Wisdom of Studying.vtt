00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.640
 Thank you everyone, again welcome everyone. Thank you very much everyone, again welcome,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:21.440
 thank you for participating and making time again. And so thank you very much to everyone.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.480
 Thank you. Again now we continue to tell about the teachings of the greatest teacher,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 Buddha Shakyamuni. And then in the context or in the within the frame of the Ketapati Ven.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 I had half advice to the 14 ones that what we've been continually discussing and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.360
 interrupting our understanding memories of the past to these practices. And so again for that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.480
 reason we should be strengthening our beautiful motivation or strengthening, reactivating our

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.280
 beautiful attitude or motivation which is so important. And I just say important, we actually

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 need to progress in the Dharma, in the spiritual Dharma, that's the only way we have to activate

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.780
 the motivation. Because motivation is the foundation, motivation is the key, attitude is the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.400
 foundation,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 attitude is the key. Wherever we like to turn, we like to turn Dharma as beautiful Dharma,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.160
 that is attitude and motivation. And we like to give Dharma as a kind of casual, normal,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.800
 insignificant, that is again motivation and attitude. And we like to turn Dharma in a little

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.440
 opposite

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:00.240
 of the Dharma, more kind of like samsara, emotion. And again it's attitude and motivation.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.840
 So therefore this motivation and attitude, what I'm using attitude is really the source,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:22.480
 the root, the cause to bring the power and benefit whichever direction we like to move,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 we like to go. That direction and that key is no one else's hand except one's own self.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.760
 And therefore, since we are love to ourselves, each of us love ourselves,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 and like to help to the other family and the friends, then

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.040
 that motivation and attitude we should activate, that is really key. So therefore this motivation

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.840
 is so important at this time. Among all the motivations we have been discussing and talking

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.760
 to you and reminded to you and to me myself is joy and appreciation. And being graceful, grateful.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.960
 All that is what started with this motivation. Our joy and appreciation is to our life,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.360
 our situation, circumstances. If I use more simple terminology or more kind of a correct

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.440
 Dharma treaty, eating endowments, that we have. Every living human beings of all don't have

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:55.200
 eating endowments, but we have. It is not just certain, what's called insignificant, casual,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.720
 it is really so brave, it's important. And then we have the Dharma. Dharma, we have the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.600
 instructions.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.040
 Dharma, that is so important, so precious. And then we have the beautiful foundations

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.920
 such as Buddha Nature. We all, so in a way, we all, not just in a way, we are ready. All the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.400
 conditions, the power of the conduct, every aspect, every religion is geared up in our power.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:38.320
 Right now, right this time. Therefore, it's so important to activate, glorify, that beautiful

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.320
 situation, sometimes less. So it's not kind of like dissipated, fading away, the activated,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.640
 renewed, repressive. We dare again to board each other. Kindness compares with thought,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.320
 for all living beings. Our son, for the beings. We like to reach enlightenment or become Buddha,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.200
 like to reach in the Rana of enlightenment, comparison is the key. Board each other is again

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.440
 so important. It is really the practices. That is, board each other is automatically is Buddha

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.040
 enlightenment. So therefore, we activated Buddha right now. Now, not kind of waiting

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.960
 in the long term, in the future. And we had that attitude or that board, we making mistakes.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:39.280
 Right now, we are in that light. We are in that path, drawn light. We are really activating that,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.400
 again, faith comparison, loving kindness, as you all know. We discussed it so many times,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.920
 you already know those things. Things are so activated, completed, for all living beings.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:57.120
 Then, to get with this, beauty realizations. And in the Vedic teaching, three Vedic states,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:06.080
 all three Gaya states, those realizations bring up. Reality level, everything is in light state.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.880
 That's what in the teaching said. We don't see right now, because due to the

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.960
 characteristics of our dualities, that duality characteristics, the movement is dissipated,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:30.640
 or taken out, the enlightenment is right here, right here. Not just partially enlightenment,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:41.760
 whole thing, home, song, space in mind, all are enlightenment states, or Buddha states.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:53.360
 That means what? All is menala of loving kindness, compassion, wisdom. That is really is all.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:01.120
 So therefore, also activating that motivation, at least kind of opening the door of that

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:10.400
 realization right now, is so important, so special in the teaching said. It is skillful means of

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:19.760
 practices. Skillful means by using special techniques to discover quick, quick realizations.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.480
 With this, then we go now with it, again, the three frames of what we have discussed.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:35.440
 Whereas, the great master, Gungheeba, and all the great master said, one echo from Buddha's time,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.820
 and two great master Gungheeba, and then continued. Every teacher, the girlfriend, great

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.760
 practitioner,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.080
 mentioned about the three novel that is. Three words, novels, I start with it.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:56.960
 Beginner novel, middle novel, and concluding novels. That is very important. And again,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.000
 this is nothing but first novel is our motivation, what I've been discussing.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.200
 About that, what we are reading, rafuddhi, bodhija, rafuddhi in the devotions. That is really what

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.000
 post novel is. Rafuddhi, rafuddhi is trust, competence, trust to yourself, trust to the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.800
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, trust to the spiritual practices. That is really the

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.600
 simple dog to the Buddha. Every breath, essential meaning. That is rafuddhi, trust, confidence.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:42.400
 And then with that, the devotions, pure joy and appreciation, richness, abundance of reach,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:51.040
 really feel that, activate that with that great joy and reach and blessings in all the connections

00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:01.760
 and wherever circumstances is blessings, truly is blessings. Bless from the lineage of masters.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.600
 Blessings from the Buddha, blessings from the Gharapam or some of them. Any blessings,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.240
 all the different situations, in different ways, blessings all are coming to our direction

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.960
 in your favor. How wonderful, how beautiful. And the same time at the courage and commitment,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.520
 we're going to use this for the right purpose, beautiful purpose to bring,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.560
 actualize it, to really bring the fruit vision of this nature. Feel that. That is

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.000
 beginning a novel. With that beginning a novel, then we begin the practices.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.600
 We begin the practices, such as the sound. We're talking about six paramattas. Six paramattas is

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.480
 essential teaching and practice of the entire teaching of the Buddha, Shakyamunas. And this is

00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.560
 the practice of all the great masters who become the great master by practicing the six paramattas.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:07.680
 This is why. And therefore, in the teaching said, "The siddhu paramadai is the great

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.920
 highway that all the Buddhas and all the enlightenment went on this highway and

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.640
 lead the enlightenment. And all the Buddhas and all the Sattvas, now they are traveling,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.320
 they end once more on this path. And all the Buddhas and all the Sattvas in the future

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:35.040
 will join in with this path and going more, moving forward with this. So this is the great one way

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:44.240
 that lead to the total enlightenment, total fulfillment, total satisfaction.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:54.160
 Christians, there's nothing else more than this. For that reason, six paramattas is the essence,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.120
 convenience, more practice, the entire teaching of the Buddha, Shakyamunas. For 45 years,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:11.120
 our 45 years, Buddha did the teaching, we lead enlightenment at 35. That all combined in these

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.320
 beautiful six paramattas. So therefore, we are touching to these traits, this beautiful,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:27.440
 really beautiful, that this path is peaceful. This path is appreciation. This six paramata is

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.760
 appreciation practices, kindness practices, compassion practices, harmony practices,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.400
 loving kindness practices, respecting appreciation to all living beings without any discriminations

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.600
.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:49.920
 It is the practice of courage and commitment, your effort to the virtues for the good reasons,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.280
 good purposes, good purpose for myself, good purpose for all the beings. It is a practice

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:08.080
 of the selfishness practices. This is, therefore, it is the great practices, great reading,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:16.400
 the spiritual. Every bundle up with that, truly we become the warriors, as in the teaching always.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.760
 Well warrior to the enlightenment, bodhisattva, I mean courageous ones, or the warriors to the

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.720
 enlightenment. Why? Because of six paramattas. That is this. So we've been talking, we've been

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:39.120
 kind of following with again, in the light of his own, or the great masters, we've been discussing

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:46.480
 that for a while, and now again we continue to talk with the six paramattas. Six paramata is the

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.560
 wisdom paramattas. We've been discussing that this is the last time, so I'm not going to talk more

00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:02.160
 about that, but however the wisdom paramata is the supreme paramattas. Because of having the wisdom

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:10.320
 paramata, all the paramata comes. That means all the first five paramattas become the paramattas.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:21.520
 So we go beyond the shows or the transcendental. It makes the transcendental beyond that. And if

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:21.680
 that

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:28.720
 means, because of wisdom paramata, may see that the yandrous paramata, or the transcendental

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.760
 practices,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:36.400
 the yandrous becomes the transcendental or the dhanaparamattas, and hila paramattas,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:45.760
 and the chant paramattas, and as well as bhriya paramattas, and the concentration paramata or

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.360
 dhyam paramattas. Because of the wisdom. Wisdom is the eyes, I said over the day, the Buddha

00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.400
 Chagimani said, the all the paramattas or five paramattas are blind if there is no wisdom.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:07.280
 But when wisdom comes, it gives eyes to every paramattas. Then really it will enter

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.320
 to their final journeys, pen and destination, bring the fulfillment to all the practitioners.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:22.400
 When wisdom comes, we know all the paramattas. So therefore, it is so powerful and so spacious.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.840
 And for that reason, this wisdom is what we are going to discuss today as great monsters,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:36.880
 and the buddhas are taught and lay out, follow that footstep as much as we can,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.840
 according our capabilities, or at least we highlight it and keep the root of those

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:53.760
 transfer meanings. So therefore, again, that is our wisdom. Now, wisdom is, again, there are many

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:02.640
 different ways to explain of the westerns. Those are, in the teaching method, the wisdom of the

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:10.160
 related truths, the wisdom of the absolute truths, the wisdom that will benefit all living beings.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:19.200
 Those are, again, one way to make the divisions of the westerns. So as what I said before,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:26.960
 last time I said the world meaning of the westerns, and the benefit of the westerns,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:36.080
 and then the distinctions, or the division of the westerns, those are among those two divisions.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.640
 Today we are talking the divisions of the westerns, division of the westerns. And now,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.800
 these wisdoms are the divisions in the divided into, as we say, kind of summarized into three

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.600
 categories.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.720
 The related truths, the wisdoms, absolute truths, the wisdoms, and the wisdoms that are going to

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.040
 help with other beings. All in the song teachings, also I mean according to the teaching,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:13.580
 wisdom, the worldly wisdoms, and the wisdom of the beyond the world, world wisdoms. And through

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.000
 that,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.480
 benefiting wisdoms. But through that, wisdoms that will benefit to the others.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.600
 And the most powerful ones in the teaching method, then these ways. And wisdom that comes from the

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:35.680
 studying, wisdom that comes from the contemplations, wisdom that comes from the meditations.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:43.280
 So I'm going to follow with these three. So that means studying, contemplating,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:57.040
 and meditation or practices. Those three wisdoms. In that three wisdoms, I also can summarize all

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.200
 the

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:08.480
 others what we meant divisions. And in this way, again, wisdom, every wisdom, also is wisdom. The

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.880
 sixth paramata, I said the other day, can be summarized into two categories. And those are

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:23.600
 skillful means and wisdoms. And that all the, for example, five paramatas, or maybe let's say,

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:34.240
 first three paramata is skillful means practices. And the last three paramata is wisdom practices,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:42.560
 or wisdoms. So skillful means and wisdoms. That is it. And the fourth one, that means

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:53.200
 the joyful effort, the virtuous paramata, is support to all the other paramata practices.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:00.800
 That is one way to explain. And some great master's teachings mention,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:10.000
 for example, four paramatas are the skillful means practices. That means what? What are those four?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:19.360
 Now I say the eight, because I say the three, now it's the four. How that is? That is the generous

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:29.440
 paramata, morality paramata, patient paramata, and the deon paramata is skillful means practices.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:40.800
 And the sixth one, wisdom is a wisdom paramatas. The joyful effort is support to all.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:50.640
 And why this deon paramata is in the skillful means? Generally, deon paramata we divide it,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:19:02.160
 or not we, in the teaching, divided three. General deon concentrations, regular worldly

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:10.960
 concentrations, and districtly understanding concentrations and concentration that will

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:20.000
 please in the Buddha's theory. So that means the first two are more conceptual levels.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.080
 That concentration is more conceptual. More port, more conceptual. Therefore, it is included.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.640
 Also in the skillful means. It's like bears.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:44.960
 And then wisdom is the wisdom. Skillful means the wisdom. Again, this six paramatas can be

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.600
 summarized

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:54.240
 in another way. Not summarized is another, it has another purpose, another pulse. And which is,

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.080
 under the rich enlightenment or become the Buddha, we need accommodating the two merits.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:14.240
 Two merits is so, so important is crucial. Because two merits will defeat two obscurations

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:21.600
 or glorify the two obscurations. It will glorify. And must we all, we all heard

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:30.240
 two merits and two obscurations many times. We heard, even we started, many of you know,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:39.360
 gladiators, terminology, and meanings. So these six paramatas is also when we practice

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:47.920
 is we are accommodating the two merits. Two merits. And the first merit is known as

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:58.560
 accumulation merits, sonam jyecho, in the debate. Sonam jyecho. Second merit is known as, as in

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:09.520
 the debate, yishi jyecho. Yishi jyecho. That is wisdom merits. So these first three or four paramat

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:09.760
as

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:21.040
 are accumulation merits. Accumulation merits, sonam jyecho, sometimes said, nanti sonam jyecho,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.320
 nanti sonam jyecho, in the debate world. Those people who are familiar with the debate world,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.760
 nanti sonam jyecho, or sonam jyecho. What means, nanti in debate, now I have another mode.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:42.640
 Nanti means something that you can hold, you can think, you can perceive,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:52.320
 perceive merit that can be perceived and can hold, or something that you can feel I'm enjoying

00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:01.600
 with subject and object and actions. That means, that merit is ah, then the generosity merits.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:14.640
 Morality merits. And patient merits. And then part of the concentration merit, maybe as I said,

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:24.790
 merits. That, of course, they all again combine to merit and to, excuse me, the wisdom they all had

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:24.800
,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:32.000
 everyone has had, but we're talking principles. Principles. So first four paramatas,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:43.520
 principally representing the accumulation merits. And also it's purified the two obscurations,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.680
 among the two obscurations. It will purify obscurations of the emotional obscurations.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:23:01.280
 It purifies, we help, or it is decreasing. And the second merit is the wisdom merits.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.640
 Wisdom is then the sixth paramat. That purify then both obscurations.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:17.920
 What? Both obscurations, emotional obscurations, and knowledge obscurations.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:27.680
 In a debate, nyumukvatyapa, shiva-deva. I'm translating, emotional obscurations,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:37.520
 knowledge obscurations. It will purify both obscurations with the support of

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:48.000
 skill means of merit. Skill means is a supporters. It is additional habits.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:58.080
 As much as we gave up the accumulation merit, that in the teachings, it will develop more

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:04.880
 wisdom merits. It really will come. Therefore, two merits goes by side by side.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:13.280
 Or skill means the wisdom goes side by side. As we use the examples in the teaching as two wings

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:24.320
 of the birds to fly in the sky. One wing cannot fly in the sky. Same way, two feet will walk

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:34.320
 and pass the distance. One walk, leg will not go very well to passing the distance.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:41.840
 Therefore, skill means in the wisdom or skill means of the accumulation merit,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:55.280
 wisdom of the wisdom merit, both are so important. Now, that true wisdom, whether it is wisdom in

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:55.600
 skill

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:04.000
 means, whether it is merit, it can summarize. Also, it is like the wisdom that comes from

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.400
 the study, the wisdom that comes from the contemplation, the wisdom that comes from

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:15.840
 the meditation, it is also within that as true merit, and it is both skill means and wisdom.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:24.640
 How that is? According to the teaching, the past truth is accumulation merits.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:32.320
 That means studying and contemplating has accumulated, it is represented more,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:43.120
 it is represented more accumulation merits. And then, the wisdom, the last one is represented

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:54.640
 mainly wisdom merits. So, this is a kind of general understanding, overview of the wisdom

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.240
 parameters.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:10.080
 All these three wisdom. Now, I go a little bit over these three wisdom. Wisdom that is studying,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:20.640
 contemplating, and practices. And then, the practice I am going to ask is in the Tibetan version,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:33.360
 tupa, samba, and gomba. And then tupa hira, samba hira, gomba hira. That means wisdom comes from

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:42.160
 the studying, wisdom that comes from the contemplating, or yeah, contemplating,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:51.120
 and the wisdom that comes from meditation or practices. So, that is. Now, the three. So, now,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:27:01.440
 I go over these wisdom, or the first study, study. Now, study that generally study all this with

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:08.800
 knowledge. You are learning knowledge. Again, knowledge is so, so important in the teaching.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.200
 Say, it is not just the teaching said, we believe it, it is truly true. Knowledge is in the

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.600
 teaching

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:26.240
 said, it is like supreme light. Knowledge is supreme light, or lame, L-A-N-P. Supreme lame,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.920
 that will dispel the darknesses. It is supreme lame, or supreme light now, maybe.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.880
 Supreme light. Knowledge is supreme trails. It will grant you all the wishes.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:50.160
 It will purify or remove the power it is. It is the wish for the jewel. It will grant

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:58.080
 all the wishes, knowledge. And knowledge is supreme like friend. Your friends,

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:07.280
 whenever there are difficult troubles, well-help is support. Knowledge will support us, support us.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:17.040
 And knowledge is great trail, safe trails. Safe trails, like saved in a safe deposit.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.480
 You're never going to worry is going to lost it or robbed by someone. Someone. Once you have

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:35.840
 knowledge is forever. That knowledge is, is. And knowledge is so powerful to you. It is supreme

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.760
 powerful like warriors. It will defeat the obstacles. Therefore, in the teaching said,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:54.880
 all the noble ones gave up the knowledge. You should gather knowledge. It's amazing. Start, learn,

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:02.080
 develop. Once you learn, you never, when do you know and learn? You don't have to worry.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:10.750
 Go into lost it and drop by someone as we discuss it. You don't have to worry. If in material world

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.960
,

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:21.760
 wealth, we worry it, decrease it, lost it, robbed. Many animals come, maybe they come, robbed and

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:31.920
 wiped by the material wealth. But knowledge, wealth is so, so unique and it's so simple,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:39.840
 so easy. It's right with you all the time. It will do everything to you. Whatever unite is one

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.280
 cradle

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:49.190
 that will support you all the time in the samsara and in the niramas. It's not just a one way homie

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.440
.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:57.640
 It's really everywhere it will happen. For that reason, in the teaching orphan man, learn knowledge

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:57.760
.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:06.160
 Don't feel tired. Don't feel think enough is enough. Never say enough to learn the knowledge.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.440
 Good. Something is good for you and good for others. In the teaching said, even you're going

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.680
 to die tomorrow. You know that you're going to die tomorrow, but still learn, gain the knowledge.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:27.120
 You're creating that beautiful imprint in our soft culture in the strong arts that when you come

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:36.640
 born back, it is like coming reappearing as like that. So your trigger, you kept somebody else,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:44.160
 ask please keep that. For me, when I need, I like to come to collect. Same way, even you learn that

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:51.520
 day before we're going to die, it will stay with our soft culture in the style. Next life, it will

00:30:51.520 --> 00:31:00.640
 come back when you need it. Easily will catch up with that. So it is so special, so important.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:09.280
 Knowledge is according to the teaching. It's true. It's always that. So therefore, this studying is

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:16.400
 so important. So starting with the work. Starting in, I'm going to say, starting the worldly

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:16.880
 knowledge

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.200
 and then beyond the world. World knowledge of that world. In the teaching said, according

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:31.040
 to the Buddhist evaluation, teaching the five, four sciences. Knowledge of the healings,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:44.400
 knowledge of the art, knowledge of the logics, knowledge of the languages. Those are the four

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:58.240
 knowledge, knowledge of the healing is like all the healing aspects. Whatever you can learn,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:05.680
 modern, meaning ancient way to healing, all the, and then to be those medicine takes them.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:11.360
 And the Pope Antares established so many really teaching. And then each different country had that.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.960
 There are so many ancient knowledges with grandparents as well. Those all is healing

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:24.240
 knowledge. Healing, it heals. It's physically healing, mainly physical healing. And then it

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:31.440
 also is mentally helping to support it too. So that is all healing knowledge. And art, knowledge of

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:40.080
 art is all geometries, geometries, all the mathematics and so forth, dharmas, theaters,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:48.320
 performance. And all those, in the Buddhist teaching said, the art of the mind, art of the

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.880
 voice, art of the physicals in the teachings. There's so many artists and all the tunes and

00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:02.160
 all those are art. And those are the knowledge of the arts and the knowledge of the languages.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.360
 And many times in the ck term, those all the different languages, that's particularly in

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.880
 it, very in ancient time talking about the Sanskrit language is very profound and a very

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:19.200
 deep issue. And more in terms such as Latin language, Greek languages, all the ancient,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.720
 all the languages, they are different way how to put things and their meanings precisely. All

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.080
 those are known as language, related with the language that is Portuguese, all those things,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:38.080
 also known as synonyms, all those are of the language. And they live with the science of the

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:45.040
 logics and the reasons. That means again, investigating, analyzing, examining, contemplating

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.400
 of these, of the things, of the subject, of the object and really kind of bring

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:58.400
 sharpness of their qualities, of what we learned. Exiling that without contradicting and seeing

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:06.160
 things, evaluating things, those are like really about the knowledge of the logic and reasons.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:14.480
 Those are known as the whole knowledges of the world, all the knowledges. And that isn't the,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.760
 those are studying those things. It's like full and there was, you know, what's called,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.850
 and world knowledges. And then in the world, beyond the world knowledges is the knowledge of the

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.720
 mind.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:36.560
 Sometimes that means many Buddha teachings, always the Buddha teaching, starting of the Vinayas,

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:44.480
 starting of the suttas, that are related with the subject of all the teachings in discussing that.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:52.240
 And the subject, those are written by the greater masters, commentaries, or greater masters such as

00:34:52.240 --> 00:35:00.320
 Nagarjuna, Asenga's of India and the sixth ornament of the world. I mean Basu, what are those six

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:14.640
 ornaments? Asenga, Nagarjuna, and Aryadeva, and so this is true. And then Basu, sorry Asenga and

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:22.960
 Basu venues are two, those are four great scholars. And then there was another two, one known as

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.120
 the

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:31.160
 master of the Dnaka, and master of the Dharmakati, these two. Those are in mostly Tibetan liter

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:31.600
atures,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.880
 always mentioned, six great scholars of the ancient, the Buddhist philosophers. And now these days

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.040
 his

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.440
 only dal lama is Mejune, those are the Nalanda great masters. As he said, true, they are all

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:52.590
 everything, they all come from the Nalanda monasteries. So they are four great masters of the Nal

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:52.960
anda's

00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.080
 monasteries, but all the eighties of the great masters, those are six. Above that, Aryadeva's

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.800
 great master, Chinta Raja, Kamala Svelas, Amideya Sohman, Chhandra Kriti's, and Chinta Gomis,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:13.120
 those all known as Indian great masters. So many great masters, they wrote commentaries on the

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.940
 teachings, such as commentaries on the preponderant teachings of the Buddha Chaturmani, comment

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.280
aries

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.380
 on the vastness teachings of the Buddha Chaturmani, and they wrote so many commentaries, so many

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.520
 great

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.680
 like this, just a beacon of the Buddha teachings or the banners of the Buddha teachings. So all

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.840
 Tiki, which is translated into Tibet, known as the Deindyo, that whenever you live there. In the

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.520
 Tibet there are so many great masters in the early times, there were also 25 disciples from

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:49.600
 Europe and some of the all great masters in the great, like in light of being the same time,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:55.920
 the greatest scholars dropped so many commentaries and so many translated that, and later there are

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.040
 so many great masters also came in Tibet, one after another, all the schools of the Tibetan

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.600
 Buddhism.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:09.040
 All those are great masters in Kimpas, great masters of Japan, great masters so far, really,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:14.000
 so many great masters came, and also in the great master who visited very as the

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.760
 Gopi Masambhava, Ajay Maasvashanta Rakita, and Articias. All those teachings are known as

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.130
 commentaries on the Buddha teachings, because they exactly explore the meaning of the Buddha's

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.720
 teachings

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:35.280
 as the Buddha told. Why everyone is following the Buddha? Because the Buddha's teaching is

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:43.920
 so accurate, so precise, so simple, so directed. It's not ups and don'ts and all these, nothing

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:51.200
 really there is leaves, kind of put on the goggles up there. Exactly direct teachings,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.110
 that, and also it's just really teachings that when you listen in the beginning time, it is

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.720
 soothing

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.400
 in the coming. When you contemplate all these teachings, then you understand the plough,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.000
 the meaning of the teachings. When you begin to practice and meditate all these, it gains the

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.640
 result as is mentioned in the teachings. Therefore, it has nothing contradictory,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:25.600
 contradictory. It's not just believing, not presuming, not just thinking, oh it is,

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:36.320
 these are not naive teachings. It is accurate, simple, direct, blend where things are teachings

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:44.400
 on that. So therefore, everyone follows the Buddha teachings, all that. Because of that,

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:51.120
 they gain that great wisdom and realizations. They are not just become the wise scholars,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:59.280
 their heart is filled with love, kindness, compassion, humble, simple, drawn to the earth,

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.200
 that every goodness call it, we explain or we could tell in a human world, really they have all

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.440
 that

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:15.920
 drawn to the earth, humble, simple, respectful, politeness, caring and concerning, concerning

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:24.800
 beautiful beings, simple beings, humble beings. Truly they are really that. And they know those

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.480
 great mastery in the Tibetas. Those are in the intellectual level, they are genius.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:39.440
 They read books and once in time, then the other stood. Their memory is a photograph of memories.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:50.160
 But yet, so humble, so simple, so casual, so drawn to the earth with full of common sense,

00:39:50.160 --> 00:40:00.240
 full of really humble, simple and mental with all everyone. Because their heart is filled with love

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.240
,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:08.320
 bodhicca, simple talk, bodhicca. That's why all is following these teachings. So those are,

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:15.360
 what do you start? What do you start? Then when you start teaching, teaching and of course,

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.560
 in the teaching of open measure, that in such as world of my perfect teacher,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:27.600
 explaining so plain and so beautifulness. A world in the mistakes of the listening,

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:36.240
 when you're starting, those are the what? The errors of the three errors, three errors.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:43.520
 And such as, and when you're, when you're in the teaching, when you're listening or when you're

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:49.600
 in the practicing or the teaching, receiving the teaching, you have to be attentively listening.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:58.560
 Listening the teachings. And you don't even listen. Your ears not listening. It looks like the

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:58.960
 board

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:07.680
 is upside down. All is upside. No matter how much water comes on that, it won't hold anything.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:17.760
 Just it goes. So that is errors. Use the examples. Errors of the ears, upside down of the board.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:25.760
 That is one of the errors. Second errors. When you receive the teaching, even your concept of

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:34.080
 listening, listening, listening, you have to maintain, keep that what you learned in the heart

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:42.720
 and mind. If you don't keep that with mindfulness, then it is known as the even borders up on like

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:49.360
 kind of normal way and receive the water. But if it is whole underneath, water won't stay.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:55.840
 It just goes away. Same way is the yilam and the shaddart of the tomb in Tibet said.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:02.880
 Means the board that has a hole goes, what is it if you don't hold? Then even you receive the

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:12.080
 teaching, you didn't catch anything. It just really goes away. Then out the board is not upside

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.400
 down.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.680
 The board has no hole and it is perfect. But while you listen in the teaching,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:27.920
 don't listen teaching with emotions. Emotions. What that means? How many emotions we have?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:36.960
 We have three principal emotions. Attachment. Anger. Jealous. Jealous. Or any other kind of

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.440
 communication it moves. And we listen, teaching with that. And what did the teaching say? It is

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:50.880
 arrows. Arrows must be the teaching you are mixing natural with ozone. Even if the teaching is like

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:57.600
 natural, but then you will mix the ozone. Then it is really not good quality of that. You mixed.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:10.720
 So therefore, free from the three arrows. Three mistakes or three arrows of the containers.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:18.560
 Then both of the teachers say so clearly, precisely, I won't believe a bit of those.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:28.480
 What are they? Those are known as them. Six stains. Six stains. Six stains.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:37.360
 And those are, as I've said, they are the first is the arrows. Second is uncarnivally not

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.160
 concentrated

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:47.040
 or you're not devoted. And you're not really interested. Even you're on the teachings.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:53.680
 Teaching, you're not so interested. And then the fourth one is, even you're in the teaching,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:00.160
 your mind is wandering into the object of five senses. Everywhere all the wondrous.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:09.520
 And then you're so much kind of like dullness just sleeping on the teachings. That is one of the

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:17.920
 strings. And then you're kind of like bored and tired or the teaching is just boring or I'm not

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.710
 kind of interested. It's just the same thing. Or it's too long or too short and making comment.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.160
 Instead

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.000
 really observing the knowledge and visit to the art and with joy and apache, making comments on

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.160
 that.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:38.160
 Those are all known as arrows. States of the listening knowledges, starting knowledges.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:46.080
 And then there is six not, five not holding, keeping to maintaining five. I'm not going to

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:52.720
 list those that. You look that, you're not interested in that. Avoiding all those things

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.200
 with the four attitudes you should have. What did the teaching say that I use in the dungkok of

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:05.680
 Ando? Again in the words of my patterned teacher, since clearly in the dungkok of the suttaras.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:12.720
 And the Buddha says, the Buddha said, you should think, you should have the attitude

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.760
 the teacher is a doctor, doctor's attitude. You tell yourself as a patient,

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:27.440
 teaching is you receive the medicines, prescription pills and structures.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:34.400
 And the practice is you're applying the medicine to yourself. So it will cure the disease.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:43.360
 Those are the poor intentions, poor attitudes. You should really keep this. In the Buddha teaching,

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.400
 each of us read what even Buddha taught him and when he is researching the teachings,

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:56.480
 even just poor lines of the words, poor lines of the word to the Muslims, he spent so much effort.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:07.040
 And when Buddha was as the bodhisattva before he got enlightened, really so many beautiful stories.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:17.120
 Buddha spent so much effort, even sometimes his own life spent to gain the wisdom,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:24.000
 to receive the teachings. Teaching is so important. It's knowledge, it's wisdom.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.800
 I say it may be an area, but the trader, it's trading. Knowledge should be honourate. Yes,

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:39.840
 field is rare, field is so precious, field is so good. Happy with that,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.400
 receiving the teaching, absorbing the teaching. Teaching, that is what is really known as

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:58.640
 learning knowledge. Learning the knowledge of studying. So you now learn it. That is studying.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.880
 Now when you really learn that, when you receive that teaching from the teacher or when you read

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.360
 the books, when you know something, now you have to think that meaning. You have to think of the

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:19.280
 word meaning, think of the meanings itself, think of the meaning of the one words. What's

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:19.840
 explaining

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:27.280
 that? And what is the direct meaning? What is the indirect meaning? What is the direct meaning?

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:37.200
 Kind of thinking of absorbing that, reflecting mind with that word and meanings, again and again,

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:44.080
 kind of make more familiar to yourself. That is known as words that comes from the studies.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:53.440
 First it is studying. First is your learning, but then now you gain something from that.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:48:00.320
 You learn something tangibles. You know the meaning, what is playing. Someday you know that.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:12.770
 That is the knowledge of the learning or studying. "Tupashira", as I said earlier, "Tupa" and "Tup

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.360
ashira".

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:22.640
 "Tupa" means to be studying. "Shigoshida" means "Tupashira" means wisdom that comes from

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:30.320
 the studies. So now you started, but also you got some words. That is foundation.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:40.960
 Fondation of the gained, higher and a deeper wisdom, such as wisdom of the contemplations,

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:49.520
 wisdom of the meditations. So now first is studies. That is so, so important that,

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.960
 and then particularly this time, what great mass department would say they're teaching,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:02.720
 that at least you should study what you're going to practice. What you're going to practice. You

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:14.000
 should learn that. You should learn that and then familiar that. That is something new knowledge,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:25.520
 new wisdom is now shining in your mind of the alliance. So that is my brief talk for today.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:31.360
 And thank you very much again for participating. Thank you so much everyone and thank you Jackie

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:43.760
 and then tomorrow we talk what's called the wisdom that comes from the contemplation and the wisdom

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:51.680
 that comes from also maybe meditation and practice. And so we see how can you do that. Okay. Thank

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:51.840
 you

00:49:51.840 --> 00:50:08.640
 everyone. Now we do the healing practice.
