00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 We're really touching to the points, points of the qualities in the teachings, and we're not

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.000
 running kind of like horse race, they're running, and then we're just going through that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.280
 So, and we're just going, and that's what also I mentioned, I was trying to do, talk this, or go

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.050
 through this, or about three years, I don't know, you know, that I said those things, and so, but I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.000
, I really feel that the confidence in myself that we're making some progress,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.950
 of the understanding and knowledge of the teachings in general, and particularly in the Dokki

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.080
 teachings, that's what I felt, and that's what also is some reminder, as I said many times,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.000
 reminding to yourself, also reminding to myself, so we're all helping.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 As a Sangha member, what did the great teacher Buddha say? Helping support each other is a quality

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.640
 and identity of Sangha members, so, some really, we're helping support each other, so that is

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.000
 really doing that, and, and so, so in that way now, we go to the, to this, this, where we are now,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 with, with this, this, and today we are here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.760
 It is the conteses of the great secret matryanas.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.560
 So we go over these meanings.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 Again, as I say that, and you know already, this already is oscillated.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.720
 So it's not something that you don't know at all.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.680
 But I'm going there something called exploring the meaning,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.080
 according the leading taught, leading master's taught, or in the teaching set.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 So that's what we're trying to do a little bit, or as much as I can do.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 That's what we do.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.440
 So now here, according to Belem, it is a great secret in the past.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 Sanchi matryamkyu.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520
 That's what Sanchi matryamkyu.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 So this is what?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.400
 Sanchi, I mean, you know secret.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.000
 We all know secret, what means secret.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.360
 And great we know, what means great.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.280
 And then we know, so matryamkyu, matryamkyu, secret.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 So now, what made the secret, actually?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:41.400
 Secret means that generally the very un-teaching is practiced by quietly, peacefully,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.280
 and in the hermitage, not announcing, not proclaiming that very low key,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.960
 keeping yourself that as personal qualities, personal practices, and practices.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.400
 That is really the secret.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.880
 That is the secret, practice that.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 And when we do that, what is the teaching set?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.080
 It will bring the result better.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.480
 Every, enormous, every kind of say these things, these and that things, all that,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.160
 then it will kind of, that energy, quality of the teaching will be of blessing is evaporated.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.200
 And there may be something, quality could come, some hindrance and there are not more kind

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.640
 of unsuccessful things if you want to some successful, and then kind

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.360
 of become a little bit more bumpy situations.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.520
 So therefore, keep quiet and secret and personal into the hermitage or your own places, practice.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.960
 So that is known as secret.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.080
 And there are many of them.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.960
 Then in the very un-teaching, in the more kind of explorative meanings,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:09.520
 there is true secret, natural secret, and then hidden secret.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.320
 All those are in the teaching set in Gohingar Bhatantara.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:23.200
 Appasana, in it available, bhappasana, hiding secret and concerned maybe secret.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.560
 Conserved, C-O-N-S-E-A-L, I believe so.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 Conserved secret.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.760
 And hiding secret, what that means?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.000
 Hiding secret means no body kept that hide, hide it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.960
 But due to our lack of the capabilities and the knowledge, intelligence,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.560
 it just be hidden, really natural hidden.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.320
 Therefore, I translate it natural hidden, natural hidden.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.600
 What are such as that?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.320
 I mean, there are so many, but big things.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.200
 Our mind is hidden.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.640
 Your mind and my mind is hidden to each other or to my mind is hidden to me.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.400
 And your mind is hidden to you.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.160
 Nobody really hide it.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.480
 And who does we find out how the mind is?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.760
 Only Buddha gave the teaching.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.400
 Santa teaches, "Oh, mind is empty now.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.560
 Mind is this and that."

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.480
 Only we explore.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.560
 Otherwise, we really never know.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.760
 For those reason, many teachings say, "Mind is always your work with us,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.920
 but never understood any book by anyone's.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.320
 How strange is."

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.560
 He really said, "It's always with us."

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.680
 Not just only us.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.200
 His mind is also in teaching, he said, "It's beyond death and birth."

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.520
 But yet, we didn't really discover.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.920
 We didn't notice it.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.840
 That's called natural hidden, big ones.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.240
 All the tatangata gabbas, Buddha natures,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.720
 I mean, so many.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.960
 And then, for example, things about what is good to us, we don't know ourself.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.040
 Even we let them do the good things, what is good for me.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.760
 They really don't know.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.480
 And there were things we don't know, what is bad for us.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.680
 How that is hiding.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.880
 So many things are hiding.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.200
 So many are naturally hidden.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.720
 We don't know the past is hidden.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.960
 We don't know the future, what is going to come.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.000
 And even in prison times, we don't know so many things.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.480
 Only we see, thanks to what we see on the front.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.680
 That also popped through in the front of the five senses.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.160
 Maybe we see that still they are detected.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.320
 Really, unless mind is paying some attention.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.680
 Not that.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.480
 Those are called natural hidden.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.280
 Natural is hiding.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.440
 So that.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.080
 And now, the second hidden is such as General already said.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.920
 Such as very inner teachings.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.680
 Very inner teaching, those are what?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.120
 In the poem, some of you may join the quoting, don't call.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.120
 Please, some of you don't call.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.440
 Enouncing the secret things is seven don't call.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.040
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.640
 Unmature of unreadiness people to the unreadiness

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.120
 between them.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.200
 Those people who are not ready to hear,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.360
 announcing or telling of the very inner teaching,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.360
 it is seven don't call.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.880
 Seven don't keep the secret.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.800
 Very profound view of the Vedayana

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.920
 and very vastness activity of the Vedayana teachings

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.200
 should not be pronounced unless people are not--

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.080
 unless they're ready.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080
 Why?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.800
 Because when you're in the nose, even thinking of that

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.960
 is maybe is going to help with something.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.200
 But if they're not ready, it will listen for them.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.960
 Listen to connected teaching in the dharma.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.520
 It's not going to benefit.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.480
 It will jeopardize their continuity of progress of dharma.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.040
 Therefore, there's so many numerous teachings.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.560
 Teachings, mention, don't mention.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.680
 So now, among these two, what is this secret matter?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.240
 Because this secret teaching of the Buddha's teaching

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.160
 will explode the profound hidden qualities,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.640
 hidden such as enlightenment, three kaya qualities.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.520
 That one is going to explode.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.760
 Therefore, it will explode or discover.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.320
 Therefore, it is called great secret.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.880
 Secret.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.640
 So that is really meaning of the secret, great secret.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.800
 Then in the Tibetan, the second word is mantra.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.520
 Mantaryana.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.880
 Mantarya is a Sanskrit word.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.840
 Of course, you all know.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.120
 And according to the teaching, the mantra has two words.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.960
 Man and the kra.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.000
 What that means in the teaching is that man means mind.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.720
 Also, I think it's simple of English, too.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.840
 Mind and man.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.400
 Man means mantra.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.240
 Oh, so man means mind.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.000
 That means protecting, protecting,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.840
 or taking out from the taboo, protecting.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.160
 So what that means, according to the teaching,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:44.200
 said mantra will protect mind from the dualities

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.200
 and as well grasping to the identities,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:01.840
 or grasping to the perception aggregates.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.840
 It will protect.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.640
 Because our mind is grasping to everything.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.240
 Everything is so serious, not just in a small way.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.440
 Really serious to everything.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.800
 This, this, this, and that, this, and that.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 Realistically, there is nothing existing as we cling,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.720
 as we hold.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.840
 Hold is not.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.040
 We grasp and cling.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.720
 And then we follow with that grasping,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.640
 clinging, and we do the perform activities,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.600
 such as known as the activity of the good activity,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.000
 bad activity, neutral activity, and which is known as karma.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.280
 We grasp with emotion, emotion.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.080
 And then we follow with that.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.000
 And then we create the activity.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.840
 And that will create the karma.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.640
 So mantra will, according to the teaching,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.640
 mantra will protect from that.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.920
 We know the meaning of the mantra

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.800
 and practice properly as it sits.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.480
 And therefore, mantra is what?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.120
 Whole meaning of the mantra is?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.440
 Is, is compassion and emptiness.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.800
 Whole meaning of the, whole world meaning of the,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.520
 meaning of the mantra is compassion and emptiness union,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.600
 not separate.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.440
 Why compassion and the version of soul important?

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.160
 Because it's nature.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.240
 Nature of what?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.560
 Of a Buddha nature.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.200
 Our nature, the own beings sometimes we use terminology.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:03.000
 All true beings is compassion and wisdom.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.560
 Also that means what?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.720
 Compassion and wisdom, to target the kind of right and left

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.400
 or kind of black and white, no.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.000
 This union with emptiness, there's

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.600
 no substrate in solid existing compassion, neither wisdom.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 That is our nature.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.200
 That nature, when it came, appeared

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.920
 in the form of the, of the skillful means

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.280
 ways to help us, guard and protect us,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.720
 then called mantras or the mantras.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.880
 So reality of mantra is?

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:55.080
 No other than the wisdom and compassion united union.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.920
 That is really mantra.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.400
 So that is, that is also echoed in this way,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400
 the greatest signal of mantra yana.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.160
 That is spirit.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.320
 Again, why?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.640
 It's naturally been a spirit.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.280
 We didn't discover compassion in the mantra.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.400
 The verses are mantra.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.200
 And we practice that compassion and wisdom

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.240
 it will task muted every negative emotions

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.760
 and transform into the verses.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.560
 Therefore mantra is so powerful.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.400
 Mantra is so powerful, that song of there

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.400
 is appeared in the form, the song,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.080
 the compassion and wisdom in mantra or the syllabus.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.160
 We join.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.240
 And that also connects to our heart or our nature

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.280
 of the mind, all beings.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.080
 Therefore it is spirit.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.640
 Spirit.
