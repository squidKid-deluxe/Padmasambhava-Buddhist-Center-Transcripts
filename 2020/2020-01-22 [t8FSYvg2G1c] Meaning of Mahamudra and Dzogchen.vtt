00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.390
 It cannot be diluted. It is an undiluted state. It is like sealed and can't be diluted or can't be

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.000
 changed by the conceptions, by the duality mind.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:30.780
 That is what is known as Ja, Seel, S-E-A-L, Seel. And what is the tempo in this case? Because this

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.000
 technique is not taught by the Grecian teacher, Buddha Shakti Aguni, in other teachings,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 such as the foundation teachings of Buddhism or the Hinayana teachings, Satramayana teachings.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.160
 This teaching is not taught by Buddha in the outer tender teaching, only in the inner tender

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
 teaching, but therefore it is known as the Great.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 It is a great teaching which is not taught in other teachings, except in the inner tender teachings

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.000
.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 So that is the word meaning of that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.610
 Then, again, I told our visit Dzochen meaning. What means Dzochen? And of course, I am sure many of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.000
 you already know that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 But Dzochen is a very old, again, Dzochen, G-Z-O-G and Dzoc and C-H-E and Dzochen. So that is Dzoc

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.000
hen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.020
 And what is Dzochen in Sanskrit? In the teaching said, "Maha-sindhi." "Maha" means say, like Maham

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.000
udra. "Sindhi" means completions.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 "Maha" or great completions. Great completions. So that is.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 Or sometimes also translated Maha-sindhi and Ati. "Maha-ati." In Ati what that means? The great

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.000
 observing status.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 The ultimate big P-E-A-K. Big of the ultimate state of the observing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.010
 All the namgya or the great namgya or the one that becomes the great familiar of the true nature,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.000
 there is nothing more go beyond that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.730
 That is the ultimate state of the discovery of the nature. So Ati. Ati. So that is what really the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 word meaning or word of the Dzochen.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.990
 Now I go to the word meaning what means the great completion. Complete. Great. Of completion first.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.000
 Dzoc. Dzoc.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Because in the teaching said, it is complete with what is Dzochen, with nature again.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.640
 Nature. Nature of the mind. One's own awareness. Nature of the mind. Everything is complete within

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 the nature of the mind.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Samsara is completed in the nature of the mind. Narayana is completed in the nature of the mind.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:29.430
 So all is both Samsara and Narayana are completed in the mind. Everything at foundational level or

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.000
 basic levels.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.270
 Then in the educational level or the practice level and both accumulation merit, worst merit are

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.000
 all complete within the nature of the mind.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So two merits are complete within the nature of the mind.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.490
 Then ultimate level, result level or achievement level or the two forms of the enlightenment is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.000
 completed.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Which means what is it? Two kyas. Two kyas in Sanskrit world and the ability of Dzochen.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 All the three kyas we say that all is completed within the nature of the mind.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Or within the Rupa state. So nothing is not complete within this teaching. Everything is complete.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 For that reason, then it is called Dzochen. Completion.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And sometimes translated as perfections or great perfect.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Because again, if we think of the perfect level, then everything within the Rupa is perfect.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Nothing is missed out. Everything is perfectly completed. Everything within that state.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.150
 And then Chimpu, meanwhile, in the teaching, said that there is nothing higher realization and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.000
 bigger realization and better realization

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 then they discover our own inner nature or our Rupa. For that reason, it is called Dzochen.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.390
 So now, what about Mahamudra and Dzochen? The reality level, both are pointing to the nature of the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.000
 mind.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 So there is nothing. There is no difference between the nature of the mind.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So it is the same. Same. There is no difference. For that reason, it is union.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 It is union. It is not just a great mass, a king of karmachami, mad union.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Also a master is mad union. It is union. It is together. It is inseparable.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 It is just different terminologies and different techniques to discover.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.740
 But the reality, the discover is the same thing. So that is really the basic meaning of the union

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.000
 of the Mahamudra and Dzochets.
