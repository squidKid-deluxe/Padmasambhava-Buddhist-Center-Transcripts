 Thank you very much, everyone. Welcome, everyone. Welcome, everyone. Thank you, very much. Thank

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.000
 you, very much.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 Again, it's one of the beautiful moments we talk about discussing the teachings of the Buddha and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.000
 the practices with joy and devotion, with determination,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.130
 and with all the good environment. It is really one of the very beautiful, I thank you all,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.000
 opportunities, and be part of this and be together.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 So thank you again, everyone. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Again, welcome, everyone. Thank you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.290
 Then, we're going to, during this week, we're going to go to the teachings of the very famous

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.000
 master, many of you all know,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.930
 known, known as Kedav Karmachami. Kedav Karmachami is the, Karmachami is his name, but Kedav is his

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.000
 title, what means scholar in the Siddharth.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 Truly, he was a great scholar and a great accomplished master, master of that. And yet, according

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.000
 to the life story, what I heard from my parents in the village,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.840
 he used to call, he was so humble, drawn to the earth. He was not, kind of like, stay in a big

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.000
 principle, a big entourage, and big things, and all that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 Stay in a hermitage, in a cave, and so humble, so simple, and practicing all the time. In a way,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 almost all, entirely his life, been practicing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.250
 So, his teaching, what he realized, what he got, visualization, he said to us, his teaching, then

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.000
 we follow it, that his teaching, his teachings,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.430
 are known as the Condensed Heart instructions of the union of the, union of the Mahamudarai, and

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.000
 looking for the practitioners.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.710
 There is series of the teachings on a bit as instructions, which is the union of the Mahamudarai

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.000
 and the Dzogti teachings.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 So, this is one of the deaf teachings, those teachings.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 So, we're going to go through these teachings during this week, as much as we can.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.730
 And so now, I go a little bit, again, generally, talk a little bit about the practices, that we all

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000
 come here to practice, and meditate,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.340
 and activate our beautiful inner nature, natural and re-glorified. That's really the purpose of the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.000
 whole, we come together here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.710
 And our also, glory is not just glory to outside, but either inner glory. Inner glory is what is

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.000
 that inner glory.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 It's the glories of the loving kindness, compassion, versatile. That is really what it is.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And that is the essence or the embodiment of that is known as bodhicama, or the realization.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 That is what is the whole practice. So therefore, let me discuss these teachings.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.190
 Again, as you all know these things, what I'm going to talk, but I'm going to go over again that,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.000
 in a way,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 remind you to all of us, not just you, for me, and we all really have to edit this little bit.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So this is, again, generally gracious teacher, Bhadakshat Yamanu, give a riot with teachings.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.180
 All those teachings are designed to benefit, to help or revert our nature, to benefit in this life,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.000
 and benefit with others,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 with the context of kindness, compassion, loving kindness, respect and appreciation.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.150
 All that teachings, all teachings, and that teaching is practiced and meditated and activated in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.000
 realization

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 totally three different ways. Those are known as starting, contemplating any meditation practices,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 and it's only a great practice has reached the highest realization, same as the Buddha himself,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.090
 one after another, and in India, in Tibet. And then Buddhism came in Tibet, in the eighth century,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.000
 full-blown Buddhism came.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And not just only academic or the books and all that, but realization also really born.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So many people individually got the realization in the eighth century.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.710
 And by the gracious teacher, Bhai Garpay Masambhava, and the great Master Shandara Kedah, and the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.000
 great Master Bhamal Matara,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 and as well as so many others, too, came, and so practiced, many, many, so many great Master Kedah,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 one after another, great practice, and that, that, continually there, continually there.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Now, what, when we practice, what are the essence of the practice in the teachings?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 This is what, again, I'm going to list. Those are the foundation of the practices.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And whether we do the retreat, whether we do individual practices, or do the retreat,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 or any time we practice, this is really the teaching, so important.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 I mean, we all have this. It's not something that we don't have. So what are those?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Those are, if I listed that, first is 18 endowments. 18 endowments.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Oh, yeah, 18 endowments. Second is devotion or the pain.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And the third is, is, is, what's called, joyful effort.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And fourth is, recidence.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And the fifth is, qualified teacher.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And then sixth is the practices. Practice without obstacles, hindrance.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Those are the six, there's a sixth group. They are like bad rocks of the practices.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 And we reflect that to each of those. We all have that.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 We have the 18 endowments. We have the devotions or the pain.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 We have the joyful effort. We have the Muslims.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 We have the qualified masters. We met so many great masters on our pranamas.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And then we received the teachings. And also we don't have much obstacles in practicing.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So that we have that. So therefore, I mean, we all have the perfect conditions, cause and condition

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 to the practices.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Now the first thing of this 18 endowments, I'm not going to list that. You all know that.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So I'm not going to list that. First is at freedoms. Definitely, we all have that at freedoms.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Ten luxuries among the 18 freedoms. Ten luxuries, that makes 18.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Ten luxuries are related with externally five.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And one's own self related with one's own self individually is five, ten.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.220
 And ten, have you looked this, even though we have the, well, we have practiced in meditation, we

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.000
 have the ten.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 But these ten luxuries is fluctuating, particularly few of those.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.190
 So that means, even though we have the ten endowments, but when we are out of the practices, we

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.000
 miss the practices.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 We can't remove the different things. Then 18 endowments is not. We don't have the 18 endowments.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 We have at freedoms, definitely. Those are at freedoms, but ten luxuries are fluctuated.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.400
 And what are actually those tens? Whenever you know, I mean, you all know, actually, this, this,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.000
 again.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 However, related with others, others, those are known as Buddha came in this world.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.280
 Those are listed, and then I will go over a little bit, maybe. You already know that, but I will go

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.000
 over that.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Buddha came this world. The second is taught the teachings. And the teachings still exist.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 And there is practitioners. There is teachers, practitioners, teachers.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 So those are the five. Five. Five that are related with others, or external others.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Five luxuries are related with one's own self. Those are known as virtual.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.180
 These are the four we are known as human beings. And the second is our organs, or the senses, are

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.000
 perfectly intact.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And the third, we are placed with the teachings available.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.230
 And the fifth is our professional activity and registry is not something that negative or, or

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.000
 negative and beneficial.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Our interesting, our professional hobby, those all quite lined up with our way of our beliefs.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And the fifth is interesting and devotions to the Dharma.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 So those are known as five related luxuries of us.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:58.420
 And what I'm seeing is that few of those ten luxuries fluctuate us. Even there is, of course,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.000
 Buddha came in this world.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 That means indicating sometimes there is no Buddha came.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Buddha is not came, did not give the teachings. And so there is no teaching available.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.340
 Even you are over-enters with them. And that is not happened. Buddha came 2,500 years ago or 600

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.000
 years ago.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And sometimes Buddha came, but the teaching is safe. There is no teaching available.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 That's not happened. The teaching is still available.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:46.940
 And third is there is the practitioners. And the fifth is our Buddha gave the still teaching is

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.000
 existing.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.510
 So sorry, I think I missed that. Buddha came, Buddha gave the teaching and the teaching still

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.000
 remain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.920
 And there are practitioners, poor. And then there is that there is practitioners and there is

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.000
 teacher available.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Those are the people. So even there is Buddha came and all that.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 But if there is no practitioners or no practitioners and no practicing, then again it's like that.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.740
 Really according to the teaching is a blocked word. And then now we're going to think of our son,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.000
 one's own son.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And we're born as beautiful human beings. That is for sure. That is perfect.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.700
 And the second is and our senses are all good. And then we're born or we are placed where the

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.000
 teaching is available.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And that is also. And there is also a lot of practitioners. That is also true.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.730
 And then the fifth one, and we're not interested in the devotions, then we are not really

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.000
 practicing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And then so it is missing. The fifth, the last one is missing.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.300
 Even though the practitioners, ever since we are not interested, ever not kind of participate in

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.000
 practice with the Sangha members or not practicing.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:26.290
 Then even the second, sorry, the fourth one, fourth one is also not really, not any lectures, any

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.000
 normal lectures.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So everything is kind of demolishing or decreasing, going down and down.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.690
 So that is not, for us, for where we are practicing, we are not in that state. Therefore we have to

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.000
.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 We have all that 18 endowments, perfectly and beautifully now, for where we are practicing.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 So that is the number one related with it. Number one of the practice analysis. So 18 endowments.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And the next one is the devotions. Devotions is so important.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.850
 Now even we have the importance, as I listed, that the ten luxuries, among that, the five luxuries

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:16.000
 related with our self, one's own self is the devotions.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.910
 So that every, somehow, if we don't have that devotional, then there is no progress, no activities

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.000
 of the practice at all.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.710
 Or no endowments. Generally there are three devotions. Those are known as the beginning devotions,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.000
 known as interest rate devotions.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Second is more desired devotions. Third is known as, then, the very confidence, trusty devotions.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 So those are the three devotions.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.110
 And the fourth one, according to the great monk, said uncheckable devotions. That is really the

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.000
 fourth best.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.650
 And it is uncheckable. No matter whatever the situation happens, you are really going to keep

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:09.000
 continually your perseverance, your joy in the devotions is so strong and beautiful.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Beautiful. So the devotions are so important.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.040
 For that reason, Mother said, many times in teaching, all the Buddhas and all the other great

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.000
 Master's making,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 with all the devotions, there is nothing, it can't be activated.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.860
 Those people who don't have in the suttara known as avatamsaka suttara said, if there is no dev

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.000
otions, those people who don't have the devotions,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 they don't have the enlightenment, they don't have the progress of the realizations. Never comes.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Therefore, with all the devotions, nothing happens. Everything is started with the devotions.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So therefore, first important is the 18 endowment. Second most important is the devotion and faith.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Faith is so important.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And the third is so important, even if you have the devotions, if you don't have the joyful effort,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 then it really won't go that far.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Even our devotions are strong.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 We have all 18 endowments, but if we don't have our joyful effort this week, then it won't go far.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And what won't go far? It won't go far any of our spiritual practices or Dharma practices.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:45.750
 In the Panya Paramata teaching, we don't have the joyful effort, our six Paramatas will become

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.000
 shaky.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 So that means generosity is not going to go well. Paramata is not going to go well.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And variety is not going to go well.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 And patience is not going to go well.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Joyful effort, then of course we are talking joyful effort, then it's lost.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 And concentration also will be shaky. And the Muslim will be shaky.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 So therefore, joyful effort is vital once we have the devotions, once we have the 18 endowments.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.520
 We know that it really won't go far. So for that reason, always in the teaching, joyful effort is

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.000
 so important. Joyful effort is the opposite of the laziness.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Laziness and distractions. So therefore, it is so important.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.300
 For that reason, it's called joyful effort. Joyful effort is combined with joy and courage and

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.000
 commitment to it.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 It really combines the target and the perseverance. It's more so strong and beautiful.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.710
 So foundation. So therefore, that once we have joyful effort, for example, now we have the 18 endow

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.000
ments.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 We have the good devotions and the pain. And we have this joyful effort.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Third important is according to teaching. Then, or the fourth story.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Fourth important is then wisdom.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Wisdom is now again so important.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.450
 And we don't have the kind of wisdom that clearly, kind of keeping that clearly, exactly on the

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.000
 track.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Then our practice, even with our devotion, will be shaky.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Wisdom is that "I" that sees everything.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 In the gracious teacher, Buddha Haryakya Muni said in the teaching, even you don't have the wisdom.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 All the parametas are blind. They are blind. And it really won't go far.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Even though good things, it won't exactly become an affectful and successful force.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 It is just kind of become blind, you see.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.540
 And what the gracious teacher said in the teaching, known as a parameta teaching, known as seta y

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.000
angaka.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And they said, if there is many, what's called many, many people, people who are blind,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 even they don't want, even they want to go to the road, they can't go on the road.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Even there is so many people who join together, it's not going to help.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Help, it won't go on the road, it won't go on the directions.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Similarly, if there is no wisdom applied, all the other parametas are become blind.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 It won't go exactly and perfectly and beautifully.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And who will take that perfectly beautiful? The wisdom.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:25.510
 The wisdom will guide all the five parametas to the right directions, then become, or become the

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.000
 transcendental practices.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.840
 Generously become transcendental, morality become the transcendental, everyone become the transcend

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.000
ental practice.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 So therefore, wisdom is so important. What is wisdom?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Wisdom is clearly understanding exactly where things are and following that instructions.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Following the instructions.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 That means, great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni told clearly and lay out perfectly beautiful as it is.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.100
 And all the great practitioners and masters kept that exactly as that way, and they become

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.000
 enlightened or great masters.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.700
 And as they shared to their class and keep that instructions in the heart, in the mind, all the

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.000
 simple way, simple that instructions.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 So those are, that is known as the wisdom.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Wisdom that means, clearly knowing exactly as it is.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And then wisdom can be divided into three.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.430
 All of us know, wisdom that sometimes teaching mentioned, wisdom that knows, related truth, exactly

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.000
 as it is.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Wisdom that knows, absolute truth, exactly as is.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And we divide them, let them pull them all, and then three, wisdom.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.350
 Wisdom that comes from the starting, wisdom that comes from the contemplation, wisdom that comes

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.000
 from meditations.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Meditation is the, what actually every kind of highlight of the,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Muslim of the starting, Muslim of the contemplation, what is that?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 That is, we highlight that, or kind of like, that is, wisdom of the relative truth.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 These both are, Muslim of the relative truth.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Wisdom of the meditation and practice, we highlight that, that is mainly, Muslim of absolute truth.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Absolute truth is beyond the intellectuals, beyond the investigation and analytic ways.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 How you can recognize is by our own awareness, self-awareness, pristine cognition,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 it will recognize that profound nature of the absolute truth as it is.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.300
 Absolute truth is also nothing, mystery or something so spiritual that absolute truth and the

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.000
 relative truth are completely connected.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 There is no difference between related truth and absolute truth.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:23.050
 So for why we don't recognize that, or we don't immediately realize that, because truth, according

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.000
 to the teaching, is our duality, grasping mind.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Just always looking one direction, and with the clinging, with the grasping.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 So that means, what is the grasping, clinging?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 According to the teaching, grasping, clinging is not natural.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 It is completely artificial.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Completely, what is the teaching says, obscurations.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Completely deluded.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 By who?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 By our self. Nobody else deluded that.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 We, our self, we clinging, we grasp, we make distractions.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Restractions, we make labels, there is nothing, any label.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 All these nominations, labels, all these ideas are not coming from outside.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Say, this is my label, this is my name, this is the disadvantage of this.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Everyone is nominated by our duality mind.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 And we follow them.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Realitally, none of those existences in that.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 But when we label that, that is according to the teaching, it is okay too.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 But we grasp it, we cling.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Then we are crashing.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 All what we label, what we are holding, back and forth, then it becomes each more and more that.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Crashing and more hindrance, more challenges, more difficulties.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 So therefore, this is what is called duality creation.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 So therefore, that reason, the absolute level is generally just everywhere.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 It is nothing really unusual.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 It is like space.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Space is everywhere. It is nothing unusual.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 But the same thing is every relative truth is united, joined with the absolute truth.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Because the absolute truth is related to the head.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 And the relative and the absolute truth are joined together.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And the way they appear is known as interdependent coordination.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 We are all connected.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 That is what the great master Narayana said.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 If it is interdependent coordination, that is absolute truth.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 If it is the absolute truth, that is then interdependent coordination.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 This absolute truth is so flexible, pervasive, or absolute truth.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 In other words, we can use emptiness.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Whatever emptiness is interdependent coordination.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Whatever is interdependent coordination is emptiness.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 They are identical.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 They are inseparable.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 But yet, we don't recognize that emptiness aspect, or the absolute truth aspect.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 We will discover that only by meditating, and then we will fully discover,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 the Buddha sees all the time, or great master sees all the time.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 That means the duality is removed.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And duality removed, then absolute truth, the relative truth, the eyes, the continues,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 those same things, same places.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 And for that reason, the Buddha gives all those sophisticated teachings.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 In the modern time, maybe we call, or not maybe, it is called,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 can be called as like quantum physics teachings.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Buddha gives that 2,600 years ago.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 All that.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 We see clearly.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 It's not something that machine or some kind of measures come.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Anyways, he gets analyzed and then found out.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 It's through his wisdom.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 See?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 And Gopin Masambha says the same thing.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 All those great masters say the same thing.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 As they meditate, they see, they conform.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Therefore, everything is in that transcendental enlightenment state.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 So that is, again, in the wisdom state.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So now, for example, we have the beautiful Indian endurance.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Second, we have the beautiful devotion and the pain.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Third, we have the joyful effort.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Fourth, we have the Muslims.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Now, what we need?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Equally teaching the practioners, then qualified teachers.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Qualified teacher, again, that is, even though we have all those first three or four,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 it's in the endowments of the precious human body or precious human lives,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 devotions, joyful effort, and the Muslims.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 What, then?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Next is what we need is a quarterly teaching of the qualified teachers.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Qualified teacher, what we do?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 That will help to activate all your beautiful qualities, what do you have?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 It will activate our eating endowments.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 It will activate our devotions.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 It will activate our joyful effort.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 It will activate our Muslims so that we can properly use and discover the benefit.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And for that reason, the gracious teacher Buddha said,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 and also in one of the parabola teachings, said, "Oh noble children,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 you should contact the qualified teacher until you become the enlightenment."

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Until you reach the enlightenment, you should have the qualified teacher.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Teacher.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 So it's not just once in a while we need, but until we become the qualified teacher.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And for that reason, we looked back in the history of all those great Muslims,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 they contacted the qualified teacher.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Qualified teacher.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And the qualified teacher, of course, there's many explanations in both,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 not just both, in the Vinaya teaching, the Mahayana teaching,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 and the Vedayana teaching, and many times see that.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 But what the great master Shandi Deva said in his teaching, to simplify that.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 The qualified teacher, the teacher who is, who are, maybe who is or who are,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 always residing on, I'm sorry, always expert of the knowledge of the teachings,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 or who knows the, not, or maybe, the qualified teacher who knows the teaching quite well.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 And knows well.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And then that qualified teacher is presiding always with the teaching,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 as teaching explains.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 So that means that qualified teacher is presiding his or her body activity as teaching,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 speech activity as teaching, and mind as the teaching says.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 So that means we're residing the body, speech, and mind within the teaching,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and then the heart is filled with body chakra, and to benefit for all the beings.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Body chakra, that individually is the qualified teacher.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 That's what really the simplified that.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Simplified that.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So that means who knows the teaching, and then, so that means can speak,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 or can teach, or can tell about the practices, dharma.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 But at the same time, not just only talking, but also practicing that.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 Practicing that.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 So therefore, that individual is body, speech, mind is completely best upon the teaching.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Gentle, peaceful, exile as teaching, I mean that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Remaining that, conduct all that, then, above that, the body chakra, the compassion.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Compassion, loving kindness is filled with that individual's heart.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 That is really the qualified teacher, the teaching said.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 So that is the way we take that as teaching.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Then, besides that, there are many, many qualified teachers explaining,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 explaining a code in the Buddha teaching, many things, but that is really the essence.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 I like that simplified that.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 And the ones you have to qualify the teacher, then the next is what, important,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 is contrary to that qualified teacher.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Hopefully, and nicely, with all the tools of the yog.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Devotion, joyful effort, no wisdom, three of that, with that three.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Devotion, joyful effort, and wisdom, and contrary to the qualified teacher.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And they receive the teachings, learn the teachings.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And that when you receive the teaching, you're going to,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 or we're going to preserve that teaching with the devotions.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 We're going to preserve that teaching with joyful effort.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 We're going to preserve that teaching with the Muslims.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 When you preserve that teaching with the devotion, joyful effort, wisdom,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 what is happening to, what is going to us?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Our body becomes gentle and peaceful.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Our verbal speech becomes gentle and peaceful.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Our mind becomes more gentle and peaceful with full of common sense, full of practicals.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 And that means what? When we become gentle and peaceful, why is it becoming?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 That means our negative emotions are suffering.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Our negative emotions, what are those negative emotions?

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 That arrogance is the letter suffering.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 And self-important attitude is the letter suffering.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 And then greed is the letter suffering.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 And together with that grasping, attachment, anger, jealous thoughts, all these softness.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 That is softly become more gentle, more softly.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 When that happens, what is coming out?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Then our greed and the fallout, our beautiful richness fallout,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 the Buddha nature begins to shine from our heart.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 More calm, more loving, more compassion, more gentle, more peaceful.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 That is the external appearance.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 But finally your realization of the understanding of this really expanding, deepening.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Then you also feel calm and peaceful.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 And also more beneficial, benefiting to the others.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Helping to the end. But what in the greatest teaching,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Mother Shakyamuni said in the teaching, "Proper the dual purposes."

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Helping to the others, helping to proper one's own wishes.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 In the context of the joy and apprehension, respects, with full of common sense,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 with the humble symbol blown to the earth.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Earth, not convalescent, hovering, clashing, these and that things.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Those are the old habit, old habit of the ego clings.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 That all happens. So really, observe it.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Then when that happens, what is so important?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 When you are really happy, now that should be really smooth ride.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Smooth vertical, sailings, smooth sails.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 So no more obstacles. Try to avoid obstacles.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Obstacles come part of the practices. Generally there is nothing.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 But they handle the obstacles nicely and beautifully.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 When we go through the lives, when we are in the life, there is always obstacle comes.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Even you read the life story of our teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 In his teaching, explain even he had many obstacles.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.310
 During his time, when he is fully enlightened, when he is giving the teaching to the old Sangha

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.000
 members,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 monks, nuns, they are practitioners.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 At that time, also some obstacles. He is so humble.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 So simple. Sitting on the same place where all the Sangha members stay.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Staying, carrying his own bagging balls, walking with bare feet, with a group of Sangha groups.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Yet, he has sometimes obstacles.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Even you read, this is part of the samsara.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Why are these obstacles coming? Because samsara has so many,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 many. It is full of negative emotions.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 So many negative emotions everywhere.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 In a way, we are surrounded with so many negative emotions.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Don't make our negative emotions. There are so many others.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Then it bursts, crashing. Then it becomes the obstacle, handles.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 But the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, all those individuals, how they handle that.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Just handle that. So, it pacifies. It doesn't affect them.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 And many times in the practicalness, when they have the difficult obstacles,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 it's part of the life you qualify, you are cleaning.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 That means harder. That means stronger.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 That means what the great teacher, Buddha, gives the teachings among the six paramsa.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Patient. Patient practices.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 That is what the gracious teacher Shanti Deva says.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 We will have no patience. We don't have patience. There is always trouble.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 There is always trouble everywhere. It is coming in every direction.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 When it is so sensitive, when it is so kind of like tempting.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 That is then what the great master Shanti Deva says. That is tempting.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Then you can't handle anything. Just become more and more obstacles come.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 And we become that. But when you have the courage, the confidence, and the strong,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 and we have the courage, the commitment, and the wisdom, those obstacles are there.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Dissolving is so nice and beautiful, not just dissolving or going away.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Because of those obstacles, we make it so stronger.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Stronger, harder, and performant than advancing our parameters and our practices.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 So therefore, that is what it is. But however, there are obstacles,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 hundreds could come. As obstacles could come externally, as I said,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 there is so many, we feel the surrender, but we have so many negative emotions.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Beings. And there is always. And then there is also so many obstacles

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 could come from, not like all the beings, but also such elements could come there.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 So there are obstacles. What is the great master, the great Muslim Dakini?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Dakini, Matik Laghram said in his teachings.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Thom Gidhiu. Those are invisible obstacles.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Invisible obstacle or untenable obstacles. There are so many things will come.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 But more, the big obstacles, most of the time, arise from our mind.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 The inner obstacle, those are what we call here, modern time, psychological troubles,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 psychological, emotional problems, psychological problems.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 And all the anxieties, all those really obstacles can come, can.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 It comes from inner. It's not coming from many things out.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Maybe it has a small percentage to do that as convergence, but cause is inner.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 All that. By the practices, then a good practitioner, those all handed,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 even those great practitioners who practice in the cave,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 they also experience those obstacles too.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 But the handle is so beautiful, as is arising.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 All the different tools, different instructions they receive,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 handle those so well, they didn't do anything.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 For when did they practice the realization, then they become the great masters.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Masters. So that's how really this goes.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 So therefore, this smooth, like once we have the post,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 we have the program of beautiful human lives, then we have the devotions,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 then we have the joy of effort, we have the Muslims,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 then we have the qualified masters, and they receive all the instructions,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 the empowerment, the teachings, all that.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Then we put that practice, make that activated.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 But preserve that one. And as you have the devotion,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 preserve that with the joy of effort, preserve it that with the wisdom,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 then bring the realization. And then can benefit it to ourselves,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 to all the things. Even the obstacles, different things come,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 but it's all going away, it's part of the process, part of the preification,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 part of the removing of all those bad habits, bad things.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 So that is the foundation of the practices,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 or the bad drugs, as I said, the six bad drugs of practices,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 then it will perform that.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 And now I will go a little bit over the teachings,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 or the life story of the greatest master and carer.
