00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
 "Innish, you are renowned as the Pema-kara, or Pema-yune, or Pema-sama. Renowned. It is

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.780
 renowned from the beginning of time, until now. It is continually renowned, continually

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:26.760
 shining, and continually guiding, and never left us, never left after us. It is always

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.080
 this. Whether we know, and whether we don't, whether you could, whether shine, and whether

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:42.840
 rain, it is all time. This nature, whether shine or whether rain, 24 hours a day, seven

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.280
 days a week, day and night, it is here. That is the beauty of this nature. It is renowned.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 Because the renowned, what the God is standing, it is free from the conceptions, free from

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.900
 the combined, compounded things. That is what it is. And then here, many, many, one after

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.440
 another, a great teacher, taught a lot of sport quotations. It is similar, all pointing

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.280
 out exactly the same, this beautiful God, this beautiful nature that we interpret. Therefore,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.120
 it is a reason, it is worthwhile, it is a reason to be ourselves, happy, joy, with competence,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:38.540
 with determination, then explore and glorify this beauty, this nature. It is our very

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.720
 responsibility

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.920
 of this life. That is love. It is love. It is compassion. It is wisdom. It is intelligence.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 It is smart. It is very expert. And it is very practical. This is what this nature is.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.200
 So good, so special. It is also very knowledgeable, consideration of things, respect and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.240
 appreciation

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.440
 to everyone. Everyone is welcome within this nature, because everyone has this nature.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 No one is strange, the aliens from this nature. Everyone inherited such a beautiful, simple,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.760
 unique. It is simple, it is unique, it is beautiful, it is rich. This is what this nature is. And

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.640
 this beautiful nature is then, again, here, I mentioned yesterday, the great Master explained,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:51.000
 and we recognize this beautiful nature, then we have to activate this, activate this. Recognizing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.600
 and not activating, this is not, then, we're not really bringing the beauty and the richness of

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.920
 this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.760
 too much. Even though this beautiful nature is guiding us all the time, time, but we're not

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.360
 getting full power, full explained qualities. Therefore, we have to activate this. Activate

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.280
 is then practice. As I said yesterday, about through the recognizing of the body and the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.920
 channel structures and wind, and then as well as essence element of body, and exactly the same,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:39.400
 those instructions. We need more practical instructions, and then we practice this.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.880
 Practicing is activating, practicing is glorifying, practicing is revealing our beauty

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.920
 nature, the beautiful nature. It is therefore, it is joyous. I said the other day, it's something

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.040
 joyful, not just boring, tiring and drugging that, but it is a beauty, right? Beautiful. Not just a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:17.760
 beauty, but it's getting joyer, joy, good, better, best. That's what it's going better, deeper and

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:26.320
 deeper and wider, then whole thing is blow up as a great joy status. This is what he said in one of

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.560
 the teaching here, I think he said, it's every, the whole pervasive joy, happy, fierce. This is

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.760
 the goal of the Vadiyana practice. Not narrowly connected, kind of, pacifically divided, something

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:52.160
 joy and happiness we're looking. We're looking at the entire, the cosmic joy and peace, happiness.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:04.240
 That joy begins from our heart. That blessfulness begins from our heart with Asugad Moojapayama

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.880
 Samadhi. There'll be this beautiful potential of the nuclear of the Western solid that we all

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:19.480
 inherited. That is the focal point. And that is the focal essential, let that prevail to every, our

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.600
 perception and conceptions. Not our conception and perception, now ruled by all this itsy bitsy,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.320
 busy, kind of like this duality and fabrication taught, taught in the narrow, this and that. For

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.030
 most, kind of like climbing on the sand mountains. This is what we are now, most time, this. This

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.440
 is

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:49.200
 the conception. That is, the deluded us and the deceived us. And that's what one most of the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.720
 carried with this abhiji practice. This generally ourself, when we're looking to ourself, I'm

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.080
 making

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.000
 one talk to you here, but it's really, it's kind of more and more is true in the teaching set too.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.720
 How our nature of the ego is, if it's good for us, we have to make such a big effort. We have to

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.840
 have

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.680
 courage, commitment, confidence, effort's good, good for us. We have to make that effort. If it's

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.700
 not good for us, we don't have to make any effort. It goes so easy. It's so, it goes there. We don

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.800
't

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.320
 even have to make effort. It's just a case. So smooth. And we just kind of swing on that. But look,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.630
 this is in the teaching set too. You lead to ourself. I mean, you lead to ourself. If it's really

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.840
 good

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:50.080
 for us, we have to make big effort. We have to have courage. We have to have confidence. We have

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 to have all the motivations geared up to bring something is really good for us. But if it's not

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:06.800
 good for us, as I said, we don't have to make any effort. And we feel happy with that, actually. We

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:15.560
 feel happy. These are things too. So for example, medicine is so bitter, right? Most of the

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.040
 medicines

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.000
 are so bitter. We really don't like to eat that. We like to cover that with what's called chew,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.560
 capsules. Capsule something, something we like to eat. But sweet, we don't need to have any color

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:42.040
 with that. Just so sweet. It is sweet. But which is good for us? Which is really good? This is just

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:51.960
 simple how our attitude, grasping is. This is the world, all of this. And therefore, again, this

00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:00.680
 explore of this, our beauty, our nature is so special. And this is the world, then. Progress,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:15.200
 our goal is true. Everything starts from here. And thenâ€¦
