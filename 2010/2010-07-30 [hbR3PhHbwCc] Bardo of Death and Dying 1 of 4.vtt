00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.100
 It's not just to one person, two persons, time this samsara started. Everybody came, stayed and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.600
 then they left.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:24.040
 That is the procedure. Not just only the older beings, but even the highest beings also left, that

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.800
 same way.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 No matter whatever that is, they left. They, in a way, went out of our sight. And that is how it is

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.000
.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.540
 And now, according to the teaching, there is generally, because this is generally that, two minutes

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.800
 to do, two.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.400
 One is called karmic life experiences, one is sudden time with a lot of obstacles.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:59.790
 This example of these two is, I think so, in the teachings, they said that, for example, if there

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.800
 is a battle land, battle land, battle land or the candle,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.000
 candle, that duration of the wax and everything is planned to stay at ours, at ours.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.760
 And that at our, started like a candle and stayed under that old, which the last drop of that wax,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.600
 wax, that is karmic death.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 And then even this is at our candle, but suddenly wind come or something fall down and start.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 Stop that light burning and that is called obstacles.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.800
 In obstacle, death is always, in the teaching said, is avoidable.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.990
 Avoidable through the medicine, through the mantra, through the practices, through the meditation,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.400
 through the ceremony, it is avoidable.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 Ma zhi thingizi, in the teaching said. Ma zhi thingizi, they can avoid that. But this death of the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 karmic death is then unavoidable.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:28.800
 Unemotable, nothing can stop. That is the expenses. Or that is the limit. Limit, you reach to the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:39.400
 limit. Limit, and therefore, that functioning of the element is not prepared to continue to care.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.550
 You know, it's just, that's it. And for that, that is then happen to eliminate all those great

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.400
 things.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.100
 And that we know. Everyone, even in the open, in the teaching said, "Buddha Shatya Muni", such that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.400
, that.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 And all that, actually, even they can change, move, but that just low, what the great things are,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 that's what the karm should, should.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 And that's what all these great masters, and great peoples, all that have.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 So, therefore, this is the how, how, how does.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.580
 And then those great, great, taught you practitioners, great, great practitioners, and then you

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.400
 heard so many times, as transcendental, wisdom, blendable, they achieved.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 But still, they changed. It's not the same that, that, what, how they started.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 That the body is changed, in a way, that element is changed.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 And then, there is also, I think, other way, in the teaching said, sometimes those great masters,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 those great, taught you practitioners,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 just instantly, kind of, left it, left it up, or left it, left it.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 In a way, suddenly, they dissipate.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 Even use an example as "pot broth".

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.400
 Pot broth, and then that sky of the pot, merged to the sky.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.690
 The sky of empty bottle, broth, and then just merging, even that, the remaining is, in a way,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.400
 evaporated, transcendental to that.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 So, those are. And then sometimes, those great masters, in the teaching, we read,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.560
 as the god of dirt, transformed into the hymn of the light, glowing light, and that light began to

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400
 lift it up in the sky,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.400
 or that you see, glowing light, something, and then this equipped.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.800
 All he did equipped, by the request of his foremost disciples, and extended his right arm, and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.400
 again, his last teachings,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.730
 which is called Satsang, there they are, the many of us, we all had a great opportunity to receive

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.400
 those teachings.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 And so, those could have.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 So, there is many, many, many of us.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 And then, many of those great masters, sometimes, they're vast, vast way.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 They don't kill any situation, circumstances, anything.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 They just vast any places, places.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 Those are the teachings said, without any expectations.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.400
 And without any kind of, like, choosing the places, this and that and that,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 wherever that happened, left that happened, that, and vast as beggars in the street,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 because many of us, they're vast, they're vast, wherever.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 It's nothing really true, particularly location, this and that, all that, as vast as beggars.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 Beggars or some guys said, without any kind of, without any expectation, as living body, as babies,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 babies.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 When babies die, they don't have any particular, supposedly, they don't have any expectation,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 this and that, or worries, anything, they just, it's a difference.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 And some guys in the teachings said that some of those great masters died,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:31.400
 without any external circumstances, died in the mountains, in hermitage, as lions, as leopards.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 They didn't get it. So, nothing, any death.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 And most of the work, now, we average person, average only person, when we die.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 When we die, and death is conduct, death is inevitable.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 And some guys in the teachings said, as maybe you heard, and said, you try three times.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.400
 You try to treat three times, do everything, it didn't work.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.040
 So that means, have treatment three times, and do the ceremony three times, do the mantra three

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.400
 times.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.400
 This is just a kind of like, ever-ready thing, but do as many as you want to do.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:23.400
 But ever, it doesn't really work. That means, now, coming out at lifespan,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400
 is rich to them, the limit, limited. I try everything.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 Medicine, mantra, ceremony, practices, everything, and that's it, nothing.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.400
 When that situation comes, then in the teaching, always said,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 then we should stay calm, peaceful, confidence, no worries.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.400
 That individually who is leaving, or who is going to die.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 But at the same time, family members, the friends, also support for that.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400
 You did everything, you tried everything, now it's not really working.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.400
 And then when that comes, don't break up any emotional statements.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 Emotional things to that person.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 Make comfortable everywhere, comfortable, happy, peaceful, quiet,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 and therefore open the kingdom, you say, tell the ugly stones to that person.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.400
 You did wonderful, you're a wonderful father, you're a wonderful mother,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.400
 you're a wonderful wife, you're a wonderful husband,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.400
 you're a wonderful man, you're a wonderful woman.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.400
 Tell all good things, you did wonderful things, everything wonderful, special.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.400
 And then they have some heads, bring up, support their heads.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.400
 Heads, not opposing, or imposing our belief,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:04.400
 or imposing each individual's belief.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.400
 But support, if that individual has some belief,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.400
 if that individual don't have any belief,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 if that individual acts up, then you should have, can have your belief.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.400
 If that person only acts, only cleans up, how?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400
 You should support and have.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.400
 Those are always in the TTC.
