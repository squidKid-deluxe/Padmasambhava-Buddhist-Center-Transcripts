00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.320
 "According to the teachings today, all phenomena are without base and without root, and that sounds

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.310
 very different from the teachings of dependent origination and karma where everything comes as a

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.000
 consequence of causes and conditions."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:32.850
 That is again, as I say, this is two different sections. What we are talking about today is our Dok

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.000
ki teaching. This Dokki teaching is Absolute Truth teaching.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 Absolute Truth, when you look from the Absolute point of view, there is no, those own causes, cause

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.000
 and conditions are not real existence.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.450
 For one reason, for example, in samsara, we said cause of samsara is negative emotions, in relative

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.000
 truth, or interdependent ordinary levels, is negative emotions.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 And cause of nirvana is positive thoughts. But where are those two positive negatives? Where that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.000
 is?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Even on the relative truth, have we tried to look to those source, or where is my loving-kindness?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Where is compassion? Where is the versus? We have that question, and search that. Where is that?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 Of course, we say is in my mind, but where is in my mind? Where is our mind anyway? And we look and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.000
 search.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.120
 Immediately, we ask that question, immediately we are in Absolute Truth. That is what I am talking

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.000
 here, I mean teaching here, everything is worthless.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.480
 On the relative level, desire the truth. There is karma, there is interdependent ordination. There

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.000
 is always cause and effects.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 For that reason, even maybe I forget to tell you, even you have the highest realization of Dokki,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.370
 but when you come to the karma contract level, follow so subtle, so detailed, detailed, detailed,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 very important.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.690
 On the other word, in the teaching said, the womb should be wide, wide, and expensive, and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.560
 limitless, but the contract should be very thoughtful, very subtle, very timid. Never bring the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.000
 womb to the contract.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 That again, when someone says they are teaching, or great things, my Dokki teachings, my womb of D

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.000
okki teaching, you should not apply to the contract, conduct and activity.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.380
 And when you do that, apply and we will become completely like atheist, or nihilism. Nihilism

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.000
 states.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.070
 But if you bring, so therefore follows subtle, leave and conduct, follow perfectly beautiful,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.000
 according to the system of the way things are.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 And that means good is good, bad is bad, and do these the right things and wrong, avoid the wrong

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:32.000
 things, that is what we live in.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.760
 Then when the great king should not bring the conroad to the womb, if you bring that, your womb

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:53.290
 will be so limited, so peaceful, it is not vastness, it is just limited, and then you never come

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.000
 out of that, you create that.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.420
 So therefore, the conroad is the contract, and the womb is the womb. Even the Dokki, the Dokki, or

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.000
 the Ben, the women, whoever, realization, that realization is heart.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.380
 The contract is action, that communicated with the world, and others follow exactly where things

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.000
 are.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.980
 And that example shows, the Buddha Chatur Muni, too. Buddha is totally enlightened beings, has a

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.260
 realization, but yet he follows exactly the same way, over his students, monks, carrying his own

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.000
 arm balls, wearing the robes, walking with bare feet with the Guru, Guru to the city, Lord to the,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 to the dhana, I mean, that's really, that's it.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.180
 I mean, Buddha didn't ignore, I have got the highest realization, I don't have to take care of the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.000
 contract. Even he taking care of all the contract, so that was the example for this.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Okay, thank you, Mr. Dovki, thank you.
