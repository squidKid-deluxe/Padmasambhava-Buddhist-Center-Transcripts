 "Six Raims, Whirl, Eh, What are you Tainting, in their own language, their own thongs, a word,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.800
 they will understand so that everyone will wake up as origin states, everyone, as bhudah,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.400
 bhudah, some of the bhudah wake up in the states, because we all have the same portage and same

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.800
 nature, as well as the city, so therefore, really, we do compassion, we do bodhichitta,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 we do commitment and devotion, chai, this grace, this again, very good, very chori practices,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.720
 also, when you chai, you can reflect the meaning that you have, it's not just the same,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.320
 all reflected to the teaching, it's directly pointing out teachings to all of us who chai,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.480
 it's very powerful, so rugged, so strong, so clean, so brilliant, and go to the heart of the really

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.480
,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:09.120
 the nature, or the heart of the obstacles, all negative emotions, obstacles, and handedness,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.240
 handedness of obstacles of our joy and peace, of well-being in the performance now, and handedness

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.960
 in obstacles for our relationship with our hope, so it's obstacles now, it's obstacles

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 future, so if we can uproot it, liberate it, that it does go into a diversity, as the teaching said

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.960
,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.640
 then, that's an absorptive practice, that is known as fearless, so chai yogi, yogini,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 oh, what tourism was, then yogini, what tourism, oh, we are getting towards our negative emotions,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.680
 we've been the troublemakers so long for us, and now we really uproot like that, it does for me,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.480
 that so is wonderful, and thank you, thank you very much everyone for what is speaking,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:17.440
 krahi delay is the best wishes to you all, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
