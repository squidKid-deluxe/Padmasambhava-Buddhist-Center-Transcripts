NOTE     "synopsis": "\"The Channels and Winds:\" Morning Dawn Study Group on Chapter 10 of The Buddhist Path by the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches\n\nI. Main Topics Being Discussed\n \n1. \"According to the tantric Buddhist system, of all the aspects of the body\u2014its bones, muscles, blood, and so on, the three principal aspects are the channels, the wind, and the essence element. The channels are the most important because they carry the wind, which moves the essence element throughout the body. When the channels are perfectly balanced, then the wind energy and the essence element are also balanced.\n The three channels and four chakras are the basic ground of the body; they are the source and the main condition for all of one's experiences and sense consciousnesses. In all human beings, the three major channels and the four chakras are basically structured in the same way. However, the minor channels are formed differently in different people. Because of differences in the minor channels, people have different personalities, different ways of talking and acting, and different experiences.\" (pg 49 1st paragraph; pg 51 2nd paragraph)\n\n2.  \"In the Vajrayana teachings there is a well-known example for the relationship between the body, the channels, the wind, and the mind. The body is like the ground or the earth, the channels are like the roads, the wind is like a horse, and the mind or consciousness is like a person who is riding the horse. If the horse is wild, the person is carried in all directions, wherever the horse ends up going. Similarly, if the wind is unbalanced, the consciousness is carried by the wind through all the channels of the body. But if the wind element is tamed, then the mind that rides on the wind is tame as well.\" (pg 52, 3rd full paragraph)\n\n\nII. Important Concepts and Terms\n\nfour empowerments [Tib. dbang bzhi; Skt. caturabhisheka]. There are many ways to explain the four empowerments, but generally speaking they are related with the crown, throat, heart, and navel chakras, respectively. As Gyurme Dorje explains, \"The four empowerments of the Unsurpassed Yoga tantras, including Mahayoga are: (1) the vase empowerment [bum pa'i dbang, at the crown chakra], which purifies the ordinary body and its energy channels into the Buddha-body of Emanation [nirmanaka\u0304ya]; the secret empowerment [gsang ba'i dbang, at the throat chakra], which purifies ordinary speech and its vital energy (lung) into the Buddha-body of Perfect Resource [sambhogaka\u0304ya]; the empowerment of discriminative pristine cognition [shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, at the heart chakra], which purifies ordinary mind and its seminal point (bindu) into the Buddha-body of Reality [dharmaka\u0304ya]; and the empowerment of word and meaning [tshig dbang rin po che, at the navel chakra], which purifies these three equally into the Buddha-body of Essentiality [svabhavikaka\u0304ya].\" (Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence, pg 155)\n\nmental formations [Tib. 'du shes kyi phung po]. The fourth skandha, or aggregate, is \"mental formations.\" The term \"formation\" is used here to convey a sense of \"bringing into being\" in both our body and mind. This is the aggregate of karma, which begins at the mental level and is then reflected on the physical and verbal levels. Every action performed in this world is part of the fourth skandha.\n\nIII. PBC YouTube Videos of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches for Further Study:\n\nThe Meaning of Windhorse Energy\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crMm5hwl1ZY\n\nOn May 27, 2011, during the Annual Windhorse Retreat at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche taught on the outer, inner, and secret meanings of raising up the windhorse energy.\n\n\nTo download the pdf of all the Main Topics, Concepts, and PBC YouTube Videos to refer to for this PBC Morning Dawn Study Webcast, go to the main \"Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\" Facebook page: www.padmasambhava.org/facebook\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 Welcome, this is the 10th webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group from Padmasamy Ling Monastery

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.000
 in New York.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Here we'll be discussing Chapter 10 of the Venerable Kheertility's book "The Buddhist Path".

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.880
 Thanks so much for joining us. We'll begin with opening prayers, and then we'll go into our

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.000
 discussion. Thanks so much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 [Singing in Tibetan]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Thanks again. So we'll begin this Chapter 10 of the Buddhist Path. I think it's on page 49.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.220
 And then I'll quickly just give a little overview leading up to this first topic point that we'll

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.000
 discuss.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.670
 So in the first paragraph, paramiches say that according to Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism, there

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.000
 are three principal aspects of the body.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And these are channels, wind, and essence elements. And in Tibetan that's sa, long, and tigle.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.450
 And among these three, the channels are the most important because if we balance the channels, then

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.000
 the wind and the essence elements will become balanced as well.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And then the channels, or the nervous system, or meridians, are the root of the body.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And after conception, in baby's conception, the first thing that is formed are the channels.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 First at the navel center, and then the channels to the two eyes are formed.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.690
 And the third paragraph that according to the inner tantras, the human body has three main channels

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.000
.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The central channel, and the right channel, and the left channel.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 And then fourth paragraph, the four chakras, or wheels, of the channels are joined to these three

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.000
 main channels.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.100
 And they are located in the four places of our body in our crown area, and then throat, heart, and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.000
 the navel.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 So these are our four main chakras of human beings.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And then the three channels and four chakras are the basic ground of the body.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 There are many other minor channels and chakras, and these form differently in different people.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And this is why different people have different experiences.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 The formations of their chakras or their channels mainly are different.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.680
 And so different beings and different types of beings see things in a variety of ways because of

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.000
 this structure of the channels and chakras are different.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.220
 And what we experience outwardly very much depends on the inner structures of our body, which

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.000
 affects our mind.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.250
 And if we know more about our body and mind, then we won't be as confused when we experience

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.000
 various external events.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 So that's more or less the first half of the chapter.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And then, Lordra, if you'd read that first topic point.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.440
 According to the Tantric Buddhist system of all the aspects of the body, its bones, muscles, blood,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.000
 and so on,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 the three principal aspects are the channels, the wings, and the essence element.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.690
 The channels are the most important because they carry the wind, which moves the essence element

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.000
 throughout the body.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.220
 When the channels are perfectly balanced, then the wind energy and the essence element are also

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.000
 balanced.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 The three channels in the four chakras are the basic ground of the body.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 They are the source and the main condition for all of one's experiences and sense consciousness.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.150
 In all human beings, the three major channels in the four chakras are basically structured in the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.000
 same way.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 However, the minor channels are formed differently in different people.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.140
 Because of differences in the minor channels, people have different personalities, different ways

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.000
 of talking, acting, and different experiences.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Page 49, first paragraph, and page 51, the second paragraph.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Thank you.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Well, I had just a brief question before we move into the details.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So now all of a sudden we have channels in the winds and the essence elements.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So have we seen this before, anywhere else, in the other yanas, like the Hinayana and the Mahayana

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 teachings up to this point?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Because I think this is Chapter 10, right?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So now we're just rushing on the scene with the body or body.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 So where do these appear in the other teachings?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 In the other teachings in this book?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.450
 And depending on the frame of view you're taking, particularly when it seems like this chapter is

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.000
 adding,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 is that here's some physical components to take with you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.850
 So particularly the way Rinpoche was stressing in here, when you bring a straightness and a balance

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.000
 to the body,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.500
 that's going to help not only straighten the channels but then the winds and the essence, all of

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.000
 that balances.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.690
 And it seems like even that itself goes off the earlier chapters of taming the mind and the causes

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.000
 and conditions of the mind.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.440
 Even though I don't think the channels were referenced before, it seems like a different view on

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.000
 that same core.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 All of these practices are going to taming the mind.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And I think this is now more of a physical element to take with it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.440
 And so I would go off of what you're saying, Lojo, and just say that I think definitely Rinpoche

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.000
 has talked previously in this book about body, of course.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 So body, speech, and mind, we all have that.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And so they've definitely talked about taming the body.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 And here I think they're introducing a more subtle level of body.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And this is specific definitely to Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Specifically I think the inner Tantra teachings of the Buddha and Guru Rinpoche.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.440
 And so I think there's a subdivision between the more common apparent way that we experience form

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.000
 or body.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And then there's a more subtle energy or a more subtle type of form.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.980
 And then both outwardly and then also specifically these chapters dealing with the more subtle

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.000
 structures of our bodies.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And so in a Vajrayana context, that's talking about a body is a relative thing.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.480
 So in terms of relative and absolute truth, it's talking about the part of relative truth of the

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.000
 body.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And then specifically in the Vajrayana context,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.220
 it's talking about how that relative truth is experienced more as in a balanced or pure way, an

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.000
 enlightened way.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 The way enlightened beings experience that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 So it could be called the pure relative truth or the pure way in which this more subtle level

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 energy

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 or structure of the body is experienced by enlightened beings.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Whether we see it or not, these great masters are saying this is the structure of our body.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And if we look at it closely, then we can experience that for ourselves too.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And maybe similar as it relates to the whole body of the Buddhist teachings too.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Both the points touch on it, so I think we'll touch on it in both of the two main points here.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.050
 But even like with interdependent origination, which is like from the very beginning of the

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.000
 Buddhist teachings.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 How just all of those, because really the channels and the winds, there are the karmic effects.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.190
 So it's again on this deeper level, looking at our experience and using that as in the process of t

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.000
aming the mind

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 and revealing our Buddha nature and everything.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 I think that the 12 links is one way from the beginning.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.270
 Of course it may not specifically, the Buddha maybe didn't talk specifically about the winds and

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.000
 channels

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 but if we look from the viewpoint of them, we can see how that is within the 12 links.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Like it just becomes more and more profound or inclusive.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 What do you think?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.680
 In terms of where it's located or how, why, so we're on chapter 10, it just almost, do you think it

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.000
 kind of pops out of the blue in the book?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 I mean it's definitely a very specific topic.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Yeah, in the book it does, but I think I don't know if the book is from a series of lectures or one

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 continuous teaching or compilation.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 But just like what you guys said too, it's a full spectrum thing.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Whatever you practice, you're not disembodied.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.260
 You're rooted, it's rooted in the body and I think it's really nice to hear how they're just

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.000
 highlighting

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.550
 our inner experience of practice of the Dharma on a mental level is so intimately related with our,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:07.000
 even our physical experience on the subtle levels and the gross levels, so that's pretty cool.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 And so far, in a way, maybe even this chapter on, I mean they're all talking about ways we can

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 apply,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.760
 but it seems like the first few chapters are giving kind of a view and a lot of the really

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.000
 essential qualities that are good to connect with that are related to the nature.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.070
 And then maybe, like now we're starting to see more looking at how the channels and winds, because

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:40.000
 this is a Vajrayana book from the inner tantras, which of course include all the nine yamas.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.400
 But then maybe the chapters after here are talking specific techniques and things we're looking at

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.000
 in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra practice.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.780
 So maybe that's it, kind of making that move closer to actual practices and things directly in our

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.000
 experience.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.280
 There's this chapter, like the second chapter that causes and conditions of the mind, I was just

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.660
 kind of looking back at that, but that's almost like, it could be like an introduction to this

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.000
 chapter.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.830
 People are kind of wanting to get a basic groundwork to maybe reread that second chapter, because

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:23.920
 it does talk about how our consciousness connects with the elements from our parents and then just

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.000
 basically a little bit about the body.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 But of course in this chapter it's more into the subtle details of that.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.090
 I think too just a really quick, important point though, is that since this is, we are moving into

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.000
 the Vajrayana and the techniques of the Vajrayana and how to see the Vajrayana body.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.800
 It seems like Rinpoche has really emphasized that at this point, we're not doing this as a means to

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.000
 gain some special...

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 It's not a yoga in the strict sense of, maybe that's the wrong word, but it's not an exercise.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.290
 We're actually getting into ways to work with the body on this deep level that's rooted in our bodh

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.000
icitta motivation, in our pure perception of the Vajrayana.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 It seems like Rinpoche has emphasized this over and over again, and they've shed on the ani-yoga.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 How the basis of all this is within the context of refuge, bodhicitta.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.190
 When you practice on these things and with these techniques, which they don't go into so much

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.000
 detail in this chapter, but that's our foundation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.950
 That's always our foundation, and if that's not our foundation, then it's not Buddhism and it's not

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.000
 a liberative technique from that perspective.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.290
 When you asked that question during the Shirda of Aum Yoga too, what's the difference between

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.000
 exercise as just a yogic discipline and a liberative...

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 What makes it lead to enlightenment, working with the channels, wins and ends and so on?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Thank you all. I think that puts a nice context.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.250
 I think there was, just to go right off that, if it's all right, that specifically Rinpoche has

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:13.000
 definitely mentioned that practices that relate to this more inner subtle structures,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.910
 like they relate to the channels and they relate to the winds, that these existed before the Buddha

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.000
 Shakyamuni came.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 In India, they had been very well established.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.780
 In addition, like mantra recitation, like these more subtle level practices that are also

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:33.000
 incorporated in Buddha's teachings of the Vashriyana or Tibetan Buddhism,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.720
 like Trulkor, these exercises with channels, or Salaam, the exercises with winds, that those

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.000
 existed prior to the Buddha coming and teaching a complete path to enlightenment.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.730
 And so, specifically regarding your point, that it is what made those practices, or what made us

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.000
 being able to use these subtle structures, actually a vehicle for enlightenment,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 that we could manifest our own Buddha nature and help others do that too.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And it's just those points you said, this motivation, this renunciation, and then based on that,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 then a bodhicitta, like refuge in bodhicitta.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.480
 And then also, like that Buddha teaching, that emptiness nature, which we've talked about many

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.000
 times in these other chapters,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.530
 of the Shammatava Pasha and I are looking directly at the nature of the mind, not just its own kind

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.000
 of dualistic karmic grasping tendencies.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.790
 But it's really good, as this topic is introduced, because it's so subtle, like, and for a lot of

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.000
 us, it's subtle that we can just have, we can only read about it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.120
 Like, we're not really directly experiencing it much, or we haven't done many practices with it, so

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.000
 we don't really know personally in our experience.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.330
 But it's just to say that, specifically, like, these techniques are in other traditions, but what

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.000
 makes them part of the Buddhist tradition,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.580
 and how Buddha specifically taught about them, is that there's a bodhicitta motivation, some degree

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.000
 of recognition of emptiness,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.250
 and based on those two principle foundations, then we're also being in touch with these subtle

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:07.320
 structures that are actually, that the Buddha says are actually there in our body, right here and

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.000
 now.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.130
 And so, I thought to just go, kind of elaborate a little more on that point you said, which is, it

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.000
's important to see.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.030
 No, I'm kind of going off of what was being said, but when I was reading through this, you know,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:30.000
 there was, you know, I think they're going into it a little bit more in the next chapter,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.660
 because I peeked and went ahead a little bit, where they're talking about posture and the breath

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.000
 purification.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.600
 But I also, you know, some of the ways they're talking in here, like, for people who are reading

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.000
 this chapter, and maybe a little bit newer,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 like, maybe, what are some of the more practical takeaways from this?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.200
 You know, because, like, they're specifically talking about being conscious of the winds, being

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.000
 conscious of the body, and holding the body, you know, straight.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.780
 So, I don't know, maybe, what were some of the more, like, practical things that people could take

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.000
 away from this now,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 and how they reflect more physically on the practice?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Yeah, so, maybe not going into the divine yoga teachings.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.420
 I think maybe this, I mean, it struck me, it's kind of, in one way it's just, it's simple and

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.000
 straight forward, so maybe that's why it could be practical,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 as far as, page 52, the middle paragraph thing, talking about the breath specifically.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Right.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.420
 Talking about how the breath, or wind energy, is an important element of the body, because it

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.000
 communicates between the outside and the inside of the body.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Yeah.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And our whole body, as well as consciousness, relies upon the breath.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 So, I mean, to me that seems like pretty, most people can relate to the fact that they're breathing

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
, and that's their way of maybe,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.780
 but that point is really nice, it's how, our breath is how we're communicating with the outer world

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.000
 and our inner world,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.320
 and the importance of that, and, like, kind of understanding that, you know, maybe, you know, we

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.000
 all have had an experience of when our energy is,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.190
 or we're feeling, like, really anxious or something, or when it's very calm, and how our breath

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.000
 changes.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.400
 So, in a way that's, it's very, I think it's very profound, of course, on one level and another

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.000
 level.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 It is something maybe practical that someone just reading this or coming into it could work with,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 or think about, contemplate.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.520
 And even when somebody's upset, and they say, "Oh, breathe deep, breathe deep, calm down," and as

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.000
 you breathe deep,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 then your mind calms, because they're related.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Well, I was wondering about the kind of implications of this for the existence of outside objects,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 and so maybe it could tie in a little bit with emptiness, too.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 If it's all, you know, from the channels, or how much of it is from the channels, winds and wind.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Can you clarify what you mean? Is that, like, what you were experiencing on our perceptions?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, if we think of, like, this table,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 how much of this is from each of our own channels, winds, and things like that.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 You know, Rinpoche's, in a way, say that.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 In the chapter here, they talk about how, in the Buddhist teachings,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 it's really these fundamental, deeper, in a way habitual patterns of the winds and the channels,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 are the way the channels are aligned and working, and how smooth they are,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.090
 how balanced, and the particular ways they intermesh and have juncture, and all of that definitely

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.000
 affects.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 So we are all human beings, and we all share very similar karma,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 and that's why, like, our three main channels are, like they say, the most the same,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 but then there's subtle differences, you know,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 and then, including, they talk about how, in, like, the different realms,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 there's even particular colors that are more emphasized, or different abilities,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 and then, obviously, different kinds of bodies, and things like that,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 are all reflections of these habitual, deeper levels of, you know,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 all coming from the mind, and then reflecting out,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 and then, you know, so our experience of our body and our world

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 is definitely related to how the channels are aligned in the teachings.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And then, just on that level of just how the whole point of what Buddha bringing means up

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 is as a means of just harmonizing and balancing the body, speech, and mind, even,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 and that's very too simplistic, but that's what it really comes back to, it seems,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 and that due to the fact everything is open and able to change and move,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 then definitely work on kind of just bringing things to a natural balance,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 and this sort of paying attention to that is all part of that, our posture, our breath.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 I mean, definitely we go on in the later chapters when we talk about meditation

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 and posture and the breath purification and mantra, and again, again,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 this is like a kind of basis setting, Rinpoche setting all the foundations

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 to understanding the Tibetan Buddhist practice.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And that's it, maybe, should we kind of merge into the second point,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 or, I mean, I want to, maybe, could I say something before we go on?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Just related to what you said, and one else's question is that,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 like what you said in terms of harmonizing body, speech, and mind,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 another way to say that is to have a balance between relative truth and absolute truth.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 So this is a core, essential teaching of the Buddha, even in, like, Sutra Mahayana,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Heart Sutra, for example, form is emptiness, emptiness is form,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 form is none other than emptiness, and emptiness is none other than form.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 It's always a union of the two truths, so there's always relative and absolute.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 It doesn't only just end up being emptiness,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 or only being relative apparent expression, either.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So in the terms of this more subtle level of structure, with sa and lung,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 or with channel and wind, this is relative,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 but it's more subtle than what we're usually dealing with.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 So in terms of, there's always a relative expression.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 It's a key teaching of the Buddha. It never ends up just being empty space.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 So there always is a relative appearance,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 and there's degrees of subtlety in those relative appearances.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 There's giant planets, and there's more medium-sized people and objects,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 and there's more subtle level buzzing of atomic structure,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 and there's subtler subatomic structure,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 and this is more saying that when the mind is more balanced,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 it can also see this very subtle way in which relative phenomena function,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 and that specifically channels and wind and essence element.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 So in one way it's saying that there's always going to be this apparent relative aspect to things,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 even if that apparent relative aspect is the mind and its movement.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 There's always a movement and expressiveness,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 and then there's a question of how does it move.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 So there's ways it moves through channels or junctures,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 or you can describe these patterns.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 There's like relative truth is always patterned because of causality, cause and effect.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 And so it's just to say, yeah, that I think this is on the relative side,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 that's in union with emptiness side, with emptiness for sure,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 but it's a subtle level relative truth that's there and available

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 for anyone to investigate and look into if they so want to, just like any science.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 You have to look into something and investigate it to see this subtler level structure.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Otherwise there's no way we ever know that water is made of H2O, which is we won't know.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 So it's saying that this is there and there is this subtle level relative truth aspect,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 which is unavoidable.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Whether if it's gross level relative truth, subtle level, and the end doesn't really matter,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 but it's saying if you're interested in also seeing this subtler level relative truth,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 and that's helpful for you on a path of enlightenment,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 then it litigate all these teachings about here's this subtle level structure

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 and here are techniques you can use to be in touch with them

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 and relate, have your mind express its goodness qualities that way too.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And this is a huge topic, your question.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 You too.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 And is it general, just one additional point.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Generally in these teachings on the channels, the winds and essence elements,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 like from say, ama yoga, they say the physical, the vajra body,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 those components of the body are like a mirror image of the external world

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 and the external world is like a mirror image of the internal physical system too,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 including like the sun and the moon and the stars and the planets and all the alignment.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So as within, so without kind of thing.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 So the more you purify your own perceptions in your own karmic vision,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 so that it travels through the channels and the winds

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 and the unimpeded way of wisdom,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 instead of just normal ordinary diluted karmic habit patterns through the channels,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 then that external appearance of phenomena actually changes from that individual's perspective.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 So even though they can recognize the table as a table,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 the wisdom element of that refined pure perception of like the vajrayana,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 the subtle level of pure relative truth starts to become more and more apparent.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 So it's like by working with ones online and the physical system and the physical body,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 from the individual's perspective, the external phenomenal world

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 actually seems like it's being purified.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 It's innate and pure according to the vajrayana, it's already pure.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 But from our perspective, we don't see it that way.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 This huge topic, what is it?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Amazingly profound, and the aniyoga scriptures too are now like the most

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 fullest expression of all the sahana and all the tantric teachings.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 They say some of the aniyoga practices, is the vajrayana the most refined pinnacle

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 of all the vajrayana ritual and practice wise is found in aniyoga.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 It's really profound and deep.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Well, the second point.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 That's the short answer.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 I think I'll do a summary thing real quick and then do the second one.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 So, this is picking up paragraph seven that by balancing the channels,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 we balance our wind, we balance the wind energy or our breath.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Since everything relies on the wind energy to happen, including the mind,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 and this will balance the mind and also our perceptions.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Then they compare like this second topic, the body to the earth,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 the channels to roads, the wind to a horse and the mind to a rider.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 And I think we're also going to pick up that quote here in a minute.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 The Nurbiches go on to say,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 "The purpose of meditation is to bring everything into a natural balance,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 and therefore it's important to know how channels affect the body

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 and how wind affects the mind.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So every moment of consciousness rides the wind energy.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Our wind energy affects how we experience time as well.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And there are two types of wind.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 There's karmic wind and then wisdom wind.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Now karmic wind is based on negative emotions and obscurations,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and wisdom wind is free from ignorance,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 so free from negative emotions and obscurations.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 And while most of the breathing and breaths we experience

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 are based on these negative habitual patterns or karmic winds,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 there are like regular wisdom winds that also happen in our system

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 and that they can be calculated in a specific way.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 But more if we get in touch to that wind system in ourselves,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 it becomes easier to recognize when that wisdom wind happens

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 as a natural process in our body,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 and that by recognizing that more easily,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 then we can extend that recognition and have that wisdom wind energy

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 last for longer and longer periods of time.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And so that will keep our winds more balanced,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 our channels more balanced, our body more balanced.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 In Zochen, they talk about these four levels of straightness related to this.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 And we've talked about this a little, keeping the body straight

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 affects keeping the channel straight, which keeps the winds balanced or straight,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 which makes the dualistic mind straight, which reveals the innate primordial wisdom.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And then they kind of conclude the chapter by saying that samsara is not straight at all,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 that it is always circling back on itself, and so this is known as the wheel of life,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 this constant korwa, or succession of wondering,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 and that based on our own ignorance and attachment, which leads to anger,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 we continually cycle and circle within this unbalanced system.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And so one way of rebalancing our system is to be in touch with these channels

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 and winds and essence elements in our mind,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 and that actually will straighten or balance our own experience,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 and then we'll become free of this cycling, of suffering,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 and become enlightened and reveal these goodness qualities we have.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 So that's the whole chapter.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Then, Ross, if you do that topic to you.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 In the Vajrayana teachings, there is a well-known example

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 for the relationship between the body, the channels, the wind, and the mind.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 The body is like the ground or the earth.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 The channels are like the roads.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 The wind is like a horse.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 And the mind or consciousness is like a person who is riding the horse.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 If the horse is wild, the person is carried in all directions,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 wherever the horse ends up going.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Similarly, if the wind is unbalanced,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 the consciousness is carried by the wind through all the channels of the body.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 But if the wind element is tamed, then the mind that rides on the wind is tamed as well.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Page 52, Third Full Paragraph.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 It's just a classic metaphor, then, if we can remember that, those points.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Body, channels, wind, mind, how they relate.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 It really lines up the teachings so beautifully,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 especially these more subtle-level teachings, I mean.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Practically, this seems like it has important implications for formal meditation

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 versus post-meditation.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Because sometimes you hear people,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 generally for beginners, when they say, "Oh, I practice while I'm doing whatever.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 I meditate while I'm doing this and that."

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Well, this is just a reminder, too, that to keep the body still can be really helpful.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 To sit, be quiet, let the winds calm down, let the speech calm down,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 let the mind calm down, engage in the practice from that.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 From that place, and then that will carry it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And then you can use that momentum to carry out through your daily activities.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 But just how it's an important point to use that as a support for you

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 as you engage in different other activities.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And the way it relates to it, even the levels of just the conditions of setting up good conditions

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 for things to just be healthy and more natural and simple and in balance more.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 So the way posture relates to that, whether you're meditating or not,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 what food you eat or the conditions you put in,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 just how any way of setting up good conditions for things to flow naturally.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:50.430
 I was just thinking about this metaphor they're using about the ground, the roads, the wind, the

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.000
 horse and the mind.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Because they keep also talking about how important it is to have the straight posture.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 And so then having straight posture means that our channels are straight.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 And so the channels are the roads.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.620
 In a way, I was just thinking, even if our mind may have a tendency to be wild by straightening the

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.000
 road,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 at least it kind of starts to direct it from there.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 And then we can work with our breath.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 So at least it's not like this way and that way.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 So just again, how important posture really is.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 I also was just thinking that in terms of what you asked earlier about for beginners.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Just really the importance of posture and working with that and then the breath.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Those are simple, very profound ways that we can really begin to tame that wild horse rider.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 I definitely agree with you, Andrew.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.660
 It does give a great level of importance to having that formalized meditation where you're

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.000
 maintaining good posture.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.510
 And at the same time, as you're saying, it gives that reminder that mindfulness of how we use our

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.000
 body in our day-to-day life.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 It's also providing that nice foundation.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Maybe not foundation, but providing a nice space for the practice to carry off the cushion as well

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 as the good on the cushion.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And carrying it forward as well.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Is there time for a question?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 I was just wondering on page 53, the top of 53, they talk about how the wind and time.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And I just was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about that.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.860
 It was a little bit confusing for me thinking about the watch that you wear is like a duplicate of

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.000
 your pulse.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 I'm late for a very important date.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 It's like time to say hello, goodbye. I'm late, I'm late.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Anything else to say?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I don't know. I get what you mean.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.400
 I think if I'm not mistaken, because we were also talking before about taking that deep, calm

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.000
 breath.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.860
 It seems like it relates to it on that level too, where when you have the healthy winds, they're

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.000
 moving at that pulse-like quality.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 But if you're rather agitated, your pulse kind of rockets too.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 It's those indicators it seems, but I don't know what you think.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Wind is movement. As far as the pulse, wind is movement.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Anything in the whole universe that's moving is the wind element.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 That aspect of the fire, the wind, the air, the wind.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 So it's like any time you move, the wind is what makes that possible in the channels.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Otherwise, they say without wind, it just wouldn't be possible to even have that.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.990
 So would you make the jump then to say that if the winds are wild, that our sense of time would be

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.000
 rapid or fast?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And vice versa, like when the winds are calm, that our sense of time is more expanded and slow?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Spacious, regulated, rhythmic, matching up with other things balanced?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.440
 Even day to day, if you have a very go-go-go-go-go kind of day, you get to the end and you're

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.000
 usually like,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 "What the heck just happened and when did it happen?"

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.050
 That kind of a thing, whereas if you're going to have a nice, calm and peaceful day, it doesn't

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.000
 feel as harried.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:48.270
 That's not particularly practice speaking as much as going crazy in the kitchen speaking from

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.000
 experience.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 I think this is as esoteric as this might be, this topic.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 We really experience this all the time in our lives.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 One really clear example is such a rushed culture.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 This time is so busy, there's a tension, there's a pressure to achieve all the time.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 There's just this rapid pulse.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 I think people feel that.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 I definitely feel that.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Just to talk about it in this context, that's wind.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 It's at tightened channels.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 It's things that aren't as open and confident.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 It's just more twisted and tight and narrow and that's all related to inner level structure

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 and how our breathing is so shallow and how we have to always just caffeinate and get supercharged

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 and overcome in impractical ways.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 It's almost as if we're beyond our bodies and we can just overcome physical limitations

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 if we just push it hard enough.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 These teachings are very clearly saying it's not really that way.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 We can do a lot if we become more sensitive to these patterns in ourselves.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Because we're already sensitive to these patterns in ourselves.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Why do we have coffee right when we get up?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Because we're sensitive to that pattern.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Maybe we're a little unconscious about it.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 At the same time, this point is that while Rinpoche has to really talk about this subtle level

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 structure

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 and this isn't just Rinpoche, but the Buddha and Rinpoche too.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 They also said that because we all have this primordial nature,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 we don't have to use these subtle level practices like of this Trulkor and Salong

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 and all these subtle level practices that because we have that pure nature already,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 we can directly connect to that nature.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 That's called Drolang, right?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Liberative practice, directly connecting to the nature.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 But as a path, to do that, for a lot of people,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 it's more practical to also incorporate our energy, our subtle level structure

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 because it's hard to just directly connect to something regardless of the conditions.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 It's really high level, hard to do.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 There's this whole system of connecting to this subtle level structure, body,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 which is a gross level body, and then using those as a way to ground

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 and create proper causes and conditions for the mind to become more balanced

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 and have that nature be revealed.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 So while it says it doesn't have to be done, it is there, the subtle level energy,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 that we're all aware of the subtle level things.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Thank you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 From the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 The preface for the cheetah and those without it may it be generated.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 And those who have it may it never diminish, but always continue increasing.
