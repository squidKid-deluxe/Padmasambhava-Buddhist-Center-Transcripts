00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 The great Master Nagardyana said also in the teaching that the Devotee films scholar, scholar and

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.000
 lecturer, and is one of the great masters, master in human history.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.690
 He also said the devotion is so important and without the devotion there is nothing really we can

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.000
 reach.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.690
 He said in one of the realization enlightenment will not come in his like the garland of the Madem

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.000
aka,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.270
 break his garland of the Mademaka. In that teaching he said, "To reach the enlightenment we need to

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.000
 ingrate," he said, "the wisdom and the devotions."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.240
 This is the most important. Wisdom is so important to look at the realization, but even before the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.000
 wisdom he said,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.090
 even before the wisdom devotion is needed to ignite and sizzling, to bring that meaning what you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.000
 learned from the wisdom have to settle in the heart.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 That is the by the devotion he said. So therefore devotion even comes before the wisdom.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 And if you have this integrated and then enlightenment will come and grow the realization.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 Because when we don't have the devotion, knowledge becomes, the knowledge of course is very

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.000
 important, it's so special,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 but knowledge becomes almost kind of dry. It really don't sink in the heart, in the mind.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 It helps, but it won't get full benefit from that knowledge.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 If we would like to get full knowledge from that knowledge to this line and the next line and all

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.000
 the time,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 then devotion is the most powerful ingredient that will make, that knowledge is absorbing the heart

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and then become,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 bring the realization. So it is like devotion is like moisture. Devotion is a warmth.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Devotion is like sunlight that brings full growth of this. The realization comes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.620
 And for that reason, then again Gurbam Sama said, at the beginning of this Laidom there is for

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.000
 reaching enlightenment,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 there is four things we need. One of that we said is so strong that devotion is the most important.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 That's what we said. So this is again general kind of overview of this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Every in the teachings said, new practice meditate, devotion you should must ignite it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.160
 So they bow each other, devotion, and for your own second thought. Those are really good to ignite

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.000
 and bring forward.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Then it's settled down that practice is just the most powerful meaning of the practitioner.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.020
 So therefore, it's just a kind of overview of the minding of the how and importance of the dev

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.000
otions.
