00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 "Blessed one, that is a perfect teacher. Perfect teacher. He had asked later, once, 'Blessed one in

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:18.530
 Tibet. Tibet is a Chomninde, in Sanskrit it is. It is a Bhagavadhi. Bhagavadhi. No, not Bhagavadhi,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:26.240
 Bhagavan. Bhagavadhi is for the female and Bhagavan is male and this time Bhagavatamuni is male and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 therefore Bhagavan is."

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:40.740
 And when you look to the Chomninde, Chomninde, Chomninde, Chomninde, that Bhagavadhi, Bhagavan,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.980
 sorry, Bhagavan translated in those great translators in 8th century into Chomninde.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.430
 Here you look in the Tibetan word, in the Chomninde, it is a blessed one, I think, but that must

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.860
 have meaning to you. We translated this and we followed with other, those translators, how they

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.340
 translated that, so use the blessed word, that which is also popular in this country or the English

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.200
 speaking word, word, word, that's what we use.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:25.090
 But blessed one, this Chomninde, Chomninde, there is three words. What is Chomninde? Chom means

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.520
 destroyed. Destroyed. Then means inherited.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 They is beyond. What is now destroyed? What is existing? And what is, is, is beyond?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 First is, is destroyed. What is destroyed? Poor demons, that many of you know, poor demons. Demon

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:09.080
 of the aggregates, demon of the dead, demon of the like, like, Chomninde, Chomninde and demon of,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.760
 what did I say, the aggregate?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:26.460
 Yes. Demon of aggregate, demon of the dead, and demon of the emotions, negative emotions, and the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.000
 demon of the distractions.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.620
 These four demons are. And demon of the, this demon of the aggregate means what? Aggregate takes

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.020
 particularly, for example, our aggregates, takes so much time.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:56.020
 It really takes so much time. And most of all things we are spending for these aggregates all our

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.040
 times. And we are so grasping. We are so clinging.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.500
 So that grasping, clinging of that to aggregate so strongly is like demons, demons. And then these

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.230
 demons, that aggregate that we so attract in, so kind of held so close to our heart, then it will

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.020
 also be destroyed by the demon of death.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.270
 Demon of death is one who is destroying that precious life, that one who is real, which cares so

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.020
 much. So therefore, it is also another form of the grasp.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:49.780
 Then demon of the emotions, that is always, demon of emotion, negative emotion is encompassed, all

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.020
 three demons encompassed. And that is then all the negativity.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.890
 Start with grasping, then with ego clinging, and then all the negative emotions, all five or three,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.020
 whatever. All that emotion. It is constantly controlling everything.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:26.770
 And the fourth one is destructions. Destructions. And destructions is then, many times, we miss the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.710
 points. For example, those practitioners in the teaching said that those practitioners, at the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.020
 beginning time, they started so intelligently,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.860
 they said, delegates, with joy, with some degree of excitement, loonging, yearning, really

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.020
 practicing. And then some degree, you got some good result, good achievements.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 When you're good at achievements, and then what obstacles will come? The demon of the distractions.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.020
 Then kind of become, oh, now I've got good realization, I've got good achievements.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.420
 And the purpose of that, people are also nice, nice to know, they're saying I'm gay and that and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.020
 that. And then you're also claiming that, what people say, almost you're lined up.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.260
 And then, that at the beginning of the, then, more destructions, more difficulties, troubles, we

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.020
 can lose the identities, identities of the rapture.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:29.760
 Loose. That is known as demon of the destructions. These four demons is the best upon the negative

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.020
 emotions, for all that control.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:41.300
 But these four demons, Buddha destroyed. Buddha destroyed, complete that four demons, destroyed,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.020
 removed, claimed with.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:54.490
 And then, because of that, because of that, then Buddha has this, I translated, I think, then, Jung

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.020
 Din, then, then means possessive, possessive or heaven.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.020
 Buddha has six great qualities, or the enlightenment has six great qualities.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:35.020
 And the first is, Buddha is, oh, so six of these, I will list the four, six of those.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:46.020
 And the very magistice, Buddha is very magistice, all very powerful, ever used, powerful.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:07:00.040
 Second is very beautiful. And then, what the God is. And then, third is very glorious, glorious,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.020
 and very beautiful.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.770
 And the next one is the fourth one, I think. The fourth one is very renowned of the good, good,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.020
 good goodness, the renowned ones.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.020
 Then Buddha has great westerns. The fifth is westerns.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:30.020
 And then, sixth is, Buddha is never going to miss the opportunities, or kind of ignore.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:38.020
 Buddha is not under the laziness, or under the control of the laziness, always alert,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:46.590
 always in a vigilant, not in a sense of the forceful, but always aware, for those reasons in the

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.020
 teaching said word.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:58.820
 Buddha sees, sees everything, past and present and future. Whoever having suffering, whoever having

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.020
 happiness, whoever needs protection,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:09.020
 whoever needs guidance, always sees. And we see Buddha never missed the opportunity.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:17.060
 S, use the example, S, tide of oceans. Tide of ocean is, according to the teaching, will come on

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.020
 the tide, exactly on the tide.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:27.020
 As needed, Buddha's activity is like tide of ocean, exactly on the tide, on the tides.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:36.030
 That's why, for example, for example, Angulamala, when he killed 999 people, the last one he's

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.020
 going to kill, Buddha is right there.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:44.020
 That is really his time to protect him. So those are the examples.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:53.020
 That's how Buddha is. Six qualities, a ten. And they mean, because of this realization,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:03.020
 because it's wisdom and compassion, Buddha is beyond Samsara and beyond Hinayana Naranas.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:11.020
 Buddha is beyond, from that, beyond that. That is the whole meaning of the Chiong-Din day.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:17.020
 And that is the description of the perfect teaching, perfect teaching.
