00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Our great teacher Buddha said, one of the, in his teachings, he said, "All noble ones, sun is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.520
 shining, beautiful, and the farmers are harvested, crows are singing, and the robbers are crying."

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.930
 He said, "What that means?" He said, "And the life is so beautiful, you spread time." He said, "

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.600
Everything is beautiful, you spread time."

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:45.130
 Sun is shining, means Buddha came, and Buddha taught the teaching, and the teaching is widely

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.120
 spread right in our hand reach, right here. That means the sun is shining.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.150
 And the teaching often said, there's many times that Buddha did not came, even Buddha came,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.000
 sometimes Buddha did not give the teaching for many years, for many years that happened.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 But Buddha came, this wall, and he turned the wheel of Dharma, light is beautiful, shining

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.720
 everywhere, and for our convenience, for our purposes.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 And because of that, the farmers are busy to harvesting or growing. That means all those who had

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:46.110
 the great, joyful effort, devotion, used their best effort to actualizing, to bring the realization

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.720
 of harvesting the merits, all the merits of their gathering.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.640
 And crows are crying, with all those many people, Sangha members, are practicing, meditating, rec

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.720
iting the suttas, suttara teachings, all the blessings.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:19.580
 And because of that, the robbers are crying, means all the ego-clinging, negative emotions are

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 crying, they are not winning.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.030
 And that's what it means. And therefore, he said, all noble ones, use time, enjoy, appreciate. That

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.720
's the Vinaya teaching, Buddha said.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.140
 This is what we have. We all have good things. Everything, every situation, every circumstances,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 both in samsara and in nirvana, we have enough. We have more than enough. We have good. Everything

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.720
 good.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.230
 When you look to the area around the world, read the news, watch the channels, how many things are

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:16.720
 going on, and on, and on, and look to us, how ourself is living, our standard of living.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:26.960
 All this. And therefore, both samsara level and dharma level, we have every good thing. It is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:35.720
 beautiful. It is our beautiful kind that we collected in the past, and then it is frightening.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 So therefore, joy and devotion and appreciation and bodhicata, and those are so important. We are

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.720
 not just self-kind of like self-important oriented beings.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.420
 We are opening our heart to all the beings, which is known as Buddha teaching. Bodhicata, opening

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.720
 our heart to all the beings, we thank them the best to everyone.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.990
 Every our intention and direction and prayers, even we do the worst prayers, we wish that thought

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.000
 to all the beings, sincerely from the heart. This is what the great teacher Buddha taught us. It is

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 not something we are smart, we know that.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.150
 We know it is a good thing to do, but why we open it? The magnitude, what we open our heart, deep

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.520
 in our collet, is because the wise world of our great teacher, Buddha Shaktamuni, and all the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.560
 lineage masters, continue the past, that openness, that wisdom, that beautiful colletus, we are on

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.720
 that roller-coast, we are on that path.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.720
 It is wonderful, it is beautiful, how precious it is.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.920
 And therefore, as I said, as our great teacher, Kainji Bodhicara, what he used to always say, "Res

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.720
identing the bodhicata, joy and devotion bodhicata."

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.910
 It is not just only him, and I read this in many books, and I heard from many great masters, and

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.720
 even the simple practitioners, low-key practitioners, that is what they taught us.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.750
 So this is our whole mark, wholesome mark, mark that we are trying to retrieve from that, re-glor

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:36.160
ify that colletus, and stay firmly on that ground, then pursue again this teaching that will glorify

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.720
 more about what we are already, and what we are already known, what we are already practicing.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.750
 It is glorify, it is strengthening, and deepening, and moving forward, and that is what is

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.720
 important.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.720
 With this understanding, and now, again, I will talk continually where we started yesterday.
