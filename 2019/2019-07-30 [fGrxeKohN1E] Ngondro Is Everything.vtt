00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 But few of you don't know it. The Ngonro is known as "Essence Teaching" of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.720
 Buddha gave the teaching for 45 years. The essence of these teachings, all different yanas,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.120
 all different yanas, all that teaching to put practice with this Ngonro is the reading essence.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.200
 The foundation practice, but it's not just the foundation, it is the central column of the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.400
 practices.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.860
 It is the practice, the central, the personal practice. And then also when we achieve enlightenment

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.160
,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 that is what we're going to achieve. So this is for, Ngonro is everything, is ground, is part, and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.720
 is a result.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.760
 And this is very, very special practice, Ngonro. And so that is what the Ngonro practices,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.300
 whenever you've already completed, whenever you're already practicing, and also those who want,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.860
 is good to really these practices, really cultivated mind, exactly, meaning what is saying there,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.760
 so good, then with the practices, just wonderful practices, wonderful merit, and all is good.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.560
 So that is really about the Ngonro. And then those people who like to know more about the Ngonro,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 there's so many books and books in the corporation and the English, and you can read,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.840
 and also some kind of practical aspects that if you like to know more, or if you don't know Italian

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.920
,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.440
 if you go out, you can ask me, or ask a little higher, and they're available, so can be

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.400
 clarification.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.480
 So that is about the Ngonro practices. And now we go to that, that is how that works.
