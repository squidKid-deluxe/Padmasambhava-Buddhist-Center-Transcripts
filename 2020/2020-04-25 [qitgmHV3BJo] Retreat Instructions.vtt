00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thank you, thank you.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 Again, we continue the teaching, short teaching, and again understanding our beautiful motivation

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.040
 of the yoga and appreciation,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.520
 and bodhicitta, a vastness, motivation of the bodhicitta, and then we will read the realization of

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 the Vedayan teaching, as of today's meditation.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.480
 So, in some teachings mentioned, raise up the motivation of the bodhicitta, and raise up the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.560
 motivation of the Vedayan teachings.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.760
 Those are the teachings also. We activate those two motivations combined with yoga and appreciation

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.600
, and again we reflect on the teachings.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 And the teaching, again, we continue going through the teachings of the heart-advised for the 14

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.000
 ones

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.960
 by Jyabjai the New Room. And today I'm going to talk briefly again about retreat. As I said

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 yesterday,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.800
 in the sense we are doing retreat this time, we are all doing retreat. Everyone who is connected

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 and who are on this,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.600
 we are listening or following this, we are all really doing some retreat. And retreat, as I said,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.160
 in Buddhism is so popular. Yes, there is really one highway where all the practitioners did, and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.840
 they are doing the harm.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.810
 And so, now we are doing that. And the retreat, when we do, there is two retreats. One is called V

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.200
arekanalay,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.780
 a strict retreat, and the other is, to be determined knowledge, said, "Go, there are those other

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.840
 very soft retreats."

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.240
 So, yesterday I mentioned of those strict retreats, who do this schedule, and that is known as a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.280
 period.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.960
 Like the period of the whole, they divided in four period or five periods. And those are, each of

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.920
 those has,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 like maybe two or three hours, or three hours, three hours, three hours. So, maybe 12 hours,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.720
 spending that.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.520
 Or maybe it has two hours. That depends, of course, you can set up your own schedules.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.020
 But, trying to, kind of, recognize time to do the practices. So, that means, also is divided as a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.760
 two,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.360
 known as the practice session, and the post-practice sessions, two practices.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.520
 So, meditate on the practice session, that's spending about eight hours, let's say, kind of like,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.720
 very kind of like, cross-level, eight hours. And then, put, that was called, eight hours, 16 hours,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.920
 then we have the time. Time, that will be the post-practice sessions. So, during the daytime,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 you're doing eight-hour practices, which is divided, and then two hours, two hours, two hours,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.600
 so forth, like that. And, be it when there is also time to pause the meditation on the practices,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.840
 and what you do during the post-meditation, such as, circumventing to the stupa, or walking

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520
 meditation.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.040
 And then, doing the post-stations, and supporting, helping to the monasteries,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.120
 or the retreat places, those are known as, in that order of letting our own beautiful

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.960
 motivation of the joy and the devotions, and of letting that. And, during that time, also keeping

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:25.440
 mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness. Those are always accompanying, whether you're doing

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.400
 retreat, or practicing session, or whether you are in post-meditation practice state,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:41.680
 mindful is always so important. It is really like, kind of, the great assistant support, or the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:50.800
 foundation of the practices. Those are in the teaching system. So, I said yesterday, above those,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.040
 kind of, a very traditional way, kind of, a strong retreat. And, many times, those retreats are

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.920
 also,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.440
 in a debate, usually, organized by one's own self. You organize yourself during retreats.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 So, that means, all the food, and lodging, and a place to stay, all that, individually supported,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.640
 or have to organize that. In many cases, also some cases, and then some, kind of, big monasteries,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.760
 or those, kind of, quite big llamas, they can sponsor and organize the place to stay retreat.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.440
 And, also, in a debate, in ancient times, also, they can provide everything, food, and all that,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.440
 even those organized by the big monasteries, maybe they organize the retreat cabins,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.240
 which place to stay, and also the teaching, all that. But, with food, they have to be, kind of,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.200
 organized by themselves, through their family members. So, that's what really they do.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.440
 And, then, now, these days, many times, retreats, those who organize by monasteries, are providing

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.240
 everything, which is wonderful, everything. So, that means, place to stay, and teaching, and,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.000
 as all those are organized by the many monasteries, or the many llamas, in the modern time, or this

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.240
 time, which is just wonderful, that. In ancient times, that has not happened all the time. And,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.960
 there is a story that, I'm sure you maybe know already, that, and by the, this is, again, related

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:37.120
 to the story by the Malareva and the Marvas. And, Malareva is very young, energetic, enthusiastic,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.120
 when he turned his mind toward the Dharma, really, he liked to do the practice, he liked to come

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:51.520
 clear with all this, his deeds, what he did in his early lives. He felt really bad, all that.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.840
 So, he heard, he had advised by this great looking master to go to see Malareva. So, he came to see

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:10.080
 Malareva, and were very enthusiastic, and very energetic, and to come. And so, he had not much

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:17.520
 offering to, as to the Marva, to his teacher, but he came and made this offering, whatever he had

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.760
 there, and then he made the statement to the Marva. He said, "I'm the come-from in the west part of

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.120
 Tibet," and who did so much big obscurations, obscurations, which is referring that he did the

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:41.440
 black maggots, and also he kind of controlled the weather, and he created the hillstones, and that

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:50.320
 killed many villages, those crops in autumn time. So, he did those things, and he said, "I did all

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:58.720
 those things, so I feel so bad, and now I came to you, and to help me to receive the teaching, I

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:09.670
 like to clear with also. I offer to you my body, and spirit, and mind to you, but you please

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.480
 provide

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:20.080
 me, and teaching, and food, and place to stay, these three." So, I said, "I offer you three, my

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.880
 body,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:30.720
 my spirit, my mind, or my heart, and you give me the teaching, place to stay, and food." And when

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:30.880
 he

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:39.440
 said that to Marva, and of course, Marva was very top to top, and smart, and he knows how to handle

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.600
 the Marva, and so he said, "That's a wonderful statement you made. You're what your courageous

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.920
 ones, what you offer me, I'm very happy to hear that, but I can do everything what you asked.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.320
 I can give you the teaching, and you have to look to your food, and place to stay, or I give you

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.800
 the

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:10.150
 place to stay, and food, and you love the teaching from somewhere else." So, that's what Marva said

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160
,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:18.000
 and Marva thought, "Oh, I did not come to have the food, and place to stay, so I come into my

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.160
 pot teaching, so I just have to receive teaching, and then I have to look those other things by my

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:34.160
 southern." He thought, and he said, "Okay, then I will look the food, and place to stay, or that

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.040
 other look, but you give me the teaching." Then he says, "Okay." So, that's the story. Ancient time

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.040
,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.320
 this logic of everything kind of provided everything that, and they all look in the search,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:55.600
 that they've started to organize anything. So, those are generally kind of like tradition,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:04.480
 called a linear retreat, and then those kind of smooth retreats that many of us, what we are doing

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:15.440
 now, is smooth retreats. It's not completely strict retreats, nor is our retreat is, as I said

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:26.400
 yesterday, there are three retreats to do, bodily retreat, speech retreat, and mind retreat. Among

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:35.840
 that three, generally in the teachings, the best is mind retreat. The best is mind retreat.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.800
 And then, most of the time, in order to have a good mind retreat, people do rich bodily retreats,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:51.760
 and speech retreats. Again, I will list what those mean. I said yesterday to you, I'm sure you

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.160
 already

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:01.360
 know those. But again, bodily retreat means that retreats from all the mundane, all the activity

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:14.240
 by physical. That is known as a bodily retreat. And verbal retreat, and also retreat from all the

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:24.480
 verbal communications, with the mundane conversations, and all that. That was known as

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:37.280
 verbal or the speech retreat. Mind retreat is, again, retreat from all the duality conceptions,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.520
 mundane duality conceptions. That is known as the mind retreats. Very simple way to tell.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:55.040
 Among that, as I said, the best is the mind retreat. And that is difficult to come immediately.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.280
 We have to work for that, with courage, commitment, joy for effort,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:10.320
 continuations. In order to become the mind retreat, then people or practitioners do

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:20.080
 bodily retreat and speech retreats. But this time, what we are doing, our situation,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:30.240
 certain times, is created naturally as a bodily retreat. And Vicky is wonderful, really good.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.920
 When we do this bodily retreat, where everyone is talking is good for us, physically is good for us

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:37.920
,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:46.160
 and also is good for others. That is wonderful. In our Buddhist practice, in what great state of

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:54.240
 Buddha say, fulfilling the dual purpose, that is both each other activities, helping to the others,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:03.040
 helping to one's own self. What is that? What is better than that? Really, very good for us,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.080
 good for the others, others, and that's what all those, this time, experts are saying to you.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:19.120
 So, even though it looks like trappings, all these things, but reality, according to Buddhism,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.520
 particularly practicing the Mahayana and the Vedayana, we are helping to the others,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:32.160
 we are helping to our self. And then Vedayana teaching, to help to our body is so important.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.400
 As I said the other day too, generally in Buddhism, that this body is so precious,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:47.040
 eating endowments it has. More than that, in Vedayana teaching, all transmission,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.600
 the body is hard, the Buddha, divine and other, this is divine and others.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:04.880
 Five aggregates are five dhyana buddhas, and five elements are five human buddhas.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:14.160
 Service and keeping up the good status of the one's own body is according to Vedayana teaching.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:23.200
 It is so precious. We are keeping up and we are honoring the divine and other according to Vedayana

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:30.240
 teachings. And then generally Buddhism is when we are keeping up, keeping up our own health and

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:41.360
 our self, we are keeping up our own wiggle, wiggle that we will use to cross the whole world of

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:51.280
 samsara. Or we are keeping up the bolt, maintaining our bolt. This body is a bolt many times in

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.680
 these

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.640
 examples. Body is a bolt, we are keeping up this bolt in order to cross the other shore.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:08.160
 That's one great master, Chandideva, said, "Use the advantage of the

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:18.320
 bolt of the human world, let's cross the other shore." That means to the enlightenment,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:26.480
 out of the troubles of samsara. In order to cross the other shore, we have to have this bolt,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.920
 so precious, so important. For those reasons, the gracious teacher,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.480
 Buddha Kshyatyam, when you open it, said, "Stay on the middle, not to ascetic

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:52.240
 and that torture into the body, no too much luxuries spoiling the body. Keep in the middle,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:02.000
 keep in the middle path." That is the way, that is the balance of how to maintain this bolt.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:11.120
 So this is really, this time I am beginning, that we are doing this retreat is very soft retreat

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:22.080
 and very gentle retreat. Retreat from the physical retreat. We are not drawing the verbal retreats,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.440
 we have all the minutes of the communication techniques. Even when we are sitting right on

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:40.000
 our own sofa, we are talking for the side of the world. Talked. And we are watching everything,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:51.440
 what is going on outside. In our own state, our own country, and then beyond our own world.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.160
 We are watching, we are keeping alive in the communication, all this in tact.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:05.280
 Tact is not something reduced, really. We are that, that way, we are not in the retreat.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.600
 In the same way, our consumption levels, we are not also in the retreat, completely.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.960
 Maybe we will retreat for a short time, two hours or two and a half hours, we are retreats

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:28.240
 of the mental retreat and verbal retreats. But rest, we are not completely retreat.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:36.320
 One retreat is the physical retreat, those are according in the teaching method, soft retreat.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:43.760
 But even we are not completely retreat of the verbal and mental retreat, but still keeping up

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:52.160
 the mindfulness is so precious, really so precious, so important. It brings back us

00:17:52.160 --> 00:18:00.800
 to the home, sweet home. Or it brings back to the best of our own balance, openness,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:07.760
 the calmness places. So bring your mindfulness, element, joy, and appreciation.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.160
 Our this body retreat, what we're doing, body retreat, also very luxurious retreat,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.680
 luxurious retreat. I said yesterday, the real retreat those great masters did,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.080
 in accord in our standard, what we will say, it is top retreat. They don't have all the confidence.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:37.120
 We have every comfort, every comfort, very luxurious retreat.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:45.280
 And then our health, in most cases, by the blessings, we are also quite good. So therefore,

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.560
 very grateful, very happy, enjoy, really use the time. We've been spending so much time

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:59.040
 and outside the world. World is so long time. I mean, of course, it depends with our

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:07.760
 age, but maybe we spend almost 30 percent of our life spending outside and doing all the different

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:14.160
 things. But this time, we can't let them over a different way to cultivate something good in

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:21.680
 a way and call it is good opportunity, good opportunity. We're developing something good.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.600
 And that aspect of our life and dimension and progress, which is really wonderful. So therefore,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.520
 with joy and happy, activating more and more each other, thinking of all living beings,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.840
 and really, we sincerely, may all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:48.560
 May they all be, every living being, free from suffering and cause of suffering.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:55.920
 May they all have that great joy, happiness, peace, never separated from that.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:06.080
 And may everyone has great opening and balance, beautiful understandings and thoughtful. May

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:12.720
 every living may have that. Really, with those sincerely and heart and mind and a relaxing,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:23.520
 expanded mind, open heart, open mind, let it go far as far as horizons, the blue sky,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.680
 merging with that. That's what the greatest teacher, Brother Shaktamuni and Gurbam Masambha said.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:38.160
 If we do that, we're really taking the beautiful meaning of life. Same time, we benefit. We're

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:46.720
 sending great, great energy, vibrations, vibrations. Maybe it's not detected by the

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.040
 satellite or any of that, but really, we're sending some beautiful energy throughout the world.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:01.760
 And beyond all the six depths. And that is, which is wonderful. Those are, the Buddhas teach

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:10.400
 in on the meaning of life. We're taking, fulfilling the very purpose of these British lives.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:17.760
 British lives. And then also same time, all that, bring more joy, more appreciation,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:26.000
 and more bond together. Kindness, compared thought. Thought. And also this all is like magic.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.680
 It's a dream. What's happening in all these situations? Is it also really like a dream?

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:41.520
 Never expected like this. I don't enable it. Now, believe it or not, it's happening.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:50.400
 It's calm. It's just a boom like this. That, but it's thanks for the, one thing is that we can

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.880
 think

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:57.200
 for things, this is not going to stay forever like this. It's going to go away. This lay in the way

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.200
,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:06.400
 thunderstorms, it go away. But however, all this is like a dream and changing.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.520
 That's what the great teacher, Buddha Shakyabhan often said. This is a dream. Life is a dream.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:23.280
 Past is a dream, present is a dream, and future will be a dream. Everything. And what we are now,

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:33.360
 or how old we are, or what we are. All the past memories, everything is only in our memories.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:41.520
 Only many of those, even not in the memories, are gone. It's like a dream. Oh, it's really.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.400
 And now it usually can't happen in all these things. The reality is, we are on the dream

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:56.160
 moves. In the future, upcoming events, all that, is also really a dream.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:04.400
 That didn't mean it's not kind of going to have any effect. The dream has effect. It is going to

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.920
 function exactly what we think, what we like to do. It's nothing changed on that reality. But

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.520
 it's reality, no? It's nothing changed to the effect level of what things happen.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:25.280
 That is how it is. This is not mystery or the mythological or the story or something.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:34.720
 This is true evidence. Surely it is without. So therefore, ever raising the truth as is truth.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:45.600
 That is great knowledge. Cover up is not knowledge. This is the whole thing. We are fooling

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:56.080
 ourselves. That's not going to do anything. Sooner or later, it will come out. Therefore,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:04.080
 truth is truth good. For that reason, what Shakyamuni said, truth is supreme.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:12.880
 There's nothing else than supreme than the truth. So therefore, to knowing those things really good

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:12.880
,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.840
 very good. But at the same time, this time, increasing our all, this beautiful motivation

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.320
 and the joy and appreciation, use all the tools that what the great master Buddha and all the

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.620
 linear masters showed us, put those to the active status as much as we can. And then it will

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.440
 benefit

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.840
 to my son or to our own son. It will benefit to the others. And that is really beautiful.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.840
 It's so beautiful, so special, even though it is again, same thing as a dream, but it's going to

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:54.000
 benefit. It's going to help to all the dream beings. We all dream beings, it will help to everyone.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.800
 So that is what really what things are. So now with that thought, I'm going to go now

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:10.570
 over this one. I'm going to highlight these points. Now in the teachings said what? I said here,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:10.720
 here,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:19.120
 as I said, the other day, I listed those are, I'm going to read this, read and I'm sure you have

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.600
 this,

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:26.880
 this, this. Thank you. The trust that the three jubals are imperiable souls of rathoms.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:33.280
 So imperiable. Those are in the Buddha teaching said, they're permeable when we practice,

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:41.360
 and the blessings of Buddhas are imperiable. True failures, or true undecipherable,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:51.600
 or that will never going to cheat us, or that will trick us. Post is, for example, our practice.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:26:00.880
 Once we take the rafuk in the Buddha dharmasana, begin to practice, that never going to cheat us,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:11.040
 that never going to disappoint us, it will bring full benefit, resolve to ourself.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:18.480
 What are those? As he said so many times, you know, by practicing the dharmasana,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.920
 by practicing and cultivating the loving kind of the complete joy and peace, happiness, relaxing

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.600
 or open the state of the mind, or relaxing on the 18th state of mind, it will bring what? More

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:44.240
 openness, more westerns, more skillful meanings, more common senses. It will relax our body,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:53.120
 it will relax our channels, it will relax our mind. When that relaxes, it will balance

00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:00.400
 every element of the part of the body. It will bring longevity, it will remove the obstacles,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:08.880
 it will remove the obscurations, it will increase all the vitality and many truths.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:21.520
 Surely it really will come. This is not deceiving statement. It never let us fall down or fell down

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:21.520
,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:30.560
 fell down and deseed it. So therefore, it is practicing dharma, cultivating our inner

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:40.160
 beautiful qualities, qualities that never let us down. So therefore, it is invalid, following

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.640
 the instructions of the teachings. Exhilar, as he said. When I say the teaching, maybe think,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:53.760
 or maybe because he is a Buddhist, therefore he is talking. No, I'm not talking about I'm Buddhist,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:01.200
 because what is teaching? Teaching is nothing but about loving kindness, compassion,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:11.440
 truth and honesty, respect and appreciation. Respect and appreciation to one's own self,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:20.880
 respect and appreciation to all the beings. What else is wrong? There is nothing wrong.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:32.080
 That's the teaching. Buddha pointed out exactly truth, exactly visual.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:42.480
 Buddha did not created anything. He himself said, "I just showed where things are,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:53.520
 where things are. That's just where things are." So if we follow that, there is no notice

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.560
 appointment,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:06.400
 really will come. And then also, blessings of the Buddhas are known as imperigable or

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:15.920
 unmistakable. And the teaching said, there is so many practices of witness, one after another,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:24.880
 that when you have the devotion impaired, when you practice and meditate, Buddhas are right there,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:33.440
 blessings are right there. That I can only tell by the stories. There is a story that during the

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:43.280
 Buddha's time, Buddhas were one of the one of the devoted and also patrons to the Buddha, known as

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:52.560
 another Hindu in Sanskrit. And in the Tibetan it is translated as Gommee sevi. He is one young

00:29:52.560 --> 00:30:00.880
 daughter, or he is one daughter, maybe not young, one of the daughters, married with a very wealthy

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:09.120
 family in the Southern Indians. And she was very much connected to the Buddha, Buddha and Dhamma

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:17.040
 and Sangha. She always missed the Buddha, really Buddha, when he went married for far.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:26.000
 So in the teaching said that. And one time, and then her friend is told, "Why you don't

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:35.840
 pray in a cold Buddha, the Buddha will come." And she told, that could be, that could be, I should

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.000
 do.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.880
 And he went on the roof, dropped the roof, the house, she prayed with the essence.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.960
 And one day he said, "We are Jamaican, we died in our prayer booklet sometimes."

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.840
 And, "You are the protector of all the living beings."

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:12.560
 And one would also remove the obstacles of the demonic forces.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:25.360
 And you know everything. Therefore, please come to him. And she joined with that praise.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:35.680
 With the essence on the roof, and Buddha came accordingly. Buddha came with the letters.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:44.800
 The center of the roof as like, as the swans in the teaching said, "Swans and swans will come to

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:44.960
 the

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:58.080
 bone in the same way. Buddha and the disciples of Ahabas are descended on the roof, roof as swans."

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.560
 Then same as the other ones too. When he agreed again, this is another story.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:15.280
 And great people came in that Buddhist. In that Buddhist, he was fascinated because he saw and

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:25.600
 many Ahabas are showing the extraordinary realization of power in walking in the skies.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:34.320
 And far distance he saw that. And he asked to his minister because he was on the roof of the palace

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.320
.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.360
 He asked, "Who there are the strangely looking birds? Who there?"

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:49.520
 His minister said, "Oh great king, this is not the strange birds. It is the disciple of the Buddha,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:58.640
 Chakraman. He was very inspired by this Buddha. They are the disciple of Buddha. Buddha said, "Yes,

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:06.080
 they are the disciple of Buddha. How can I meet him?" He said, "Again, if you call him, he will

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.400
 come."

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:17.600
 And then again he did prayers. And Buddha came. As I said the other day, when you read

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.320
 enlightenment,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:29.440
 Buddha's activity is pervasive on the time and it's instantaneous. And as also I use the examples,

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:39.440
 say the tides of ocean can change. Can change. But the timing of the Buddha for the reward is

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:49.280
 never going to change. Change. That is like accurate or punctuated. Ocean tide, suppose,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:57.840
 is always on the tide. High tide, low tide or whatever it is. But that can be mixed up sometimes.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:06.000
 Buddha's timing, like enlightened beings, because they are loving kindness and compassion for all

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:14.800
 the living beings. Their realization and their wisdom has no doubt as according to the teachings.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:22.400
 Welcome. Then I said quite a few stories. When you have the devotion, confidence,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:30.160
 trusty or infallible confidence, the story of the Kung Kong being, how he able to

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:39.920
 see the Joe Ramboches, Buddha Chaturmani, and talk to him and come to him as he invited.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:49.280
 And we have the trust, confidence, trust, or devotions, that old ladies,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:59.120
 dog teeth become relaxed and she got big realizations. Those are the few stories.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:06.400
 But every old that really witnessed by so many practitioners, but regularly in the 16th,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:13.920
 this in the 19th century, in the 60s, so many Tibetans went on the big tragedy. You all know,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:21.040
 I'm not going to talk about details. So many have got so much troubles one after another.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:30.400
 But those people who are able to come out of Tibet in India, every ruffled are talking each

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:39.600
 other stories about how they are able to come. It's miraculous. It's unbelievable. One after

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.400
 another.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:47.760
 Really, it's nothing but it's a blessing. Because they have the trust, they have the confidence,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.720
 they practice it. Even they didn't have the high realizations, but their confidence

00:35:52.720 --> 00:36:02.800
 and the connection is loyal. It's not lingering. They keep life, even the hardest, difficult time.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:11.600
 Time, their spirit is shining and glowing. Those are the really evidence of that it's not going to

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:21.120
 fail, don't ask. This is not that. And then also we see many of those our loved ones and our great

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.000
 masters entering the Mahabharic nirvana, which is the honor of the God, but they are passing.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 The moment of death, they are calm and fierce, happy and relaxed. In a way, it looks like they're

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:47.120
 looking forward. I'm not kidding. Those all are the sign and result of the practice of the dharma.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:58.880
 That shows what they think, thought and did practices during their lifetime. It is rewarding,

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.000
 rewarding. This is not going to end to their last moment of death.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.280
 They call on the teaching, that is the beginning of the bright sunshine of the futures.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:19.920
 Futures begins from there, really, that. What is the teaching say? The good practices,

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:27.120
 life will be big, that life is beginning to jog. Jog of that practice at that time, that will be

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.600
 joy. But the moment of death, they will be happy and peaceful in a moment of death. And after the

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:41.120
 death, even more free and more, and next birth will be more, more happy and joyful, peaceful,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.800
 and more realization, more confidence. Those are really in the teaching said that.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:54.640
 Teaching said, and we've something, what is our self? This is, so this is my great kind of story

00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:01.840
 of this, this, and then tomorrow I'm going to go to the next line. I've been talking this,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:08.240
 this one, and I'm not sure, maybe you're thinking, talking all this kind of same thing again, again

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.240
.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.720
 But I'm trying to point, highlight and discover kind of a little bit, the meaning of it,

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.720
 so that we can all kind of activate it, our some real realization, the teaching of the Buddha.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:27.280
 Buddha, and the Buddha, Buddha's teaching is really like as deep as ocean in the teaching said,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:34.560
 because there's just so many beautiful things to discover, our own qualities, our nature,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.000
 and the beautiful things. So that's what we're trying to go as much as we can do in the following

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.400
 worlds, or light worlds, wisdom worlds of the great lineage masters. That's what we're doing.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.320
 And so again, thank you very much for participating, and listening here. Thank you very much.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.920
 Thank you, thank you. Again we do short meditation.
