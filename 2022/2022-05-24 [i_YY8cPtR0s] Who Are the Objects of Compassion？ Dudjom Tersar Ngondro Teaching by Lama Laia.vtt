00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Again, as we set out, just if we haven't already, continuing to just connect with our pure

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.680
 motivation,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.280
 our joy, our appreciation, renunciation thoughts, reflecting on the four thoughts that turn the

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.320
 mind towards what's true and reliable, which is the beautiful, supreme teachings of the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:39.680
 Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava that we are so fortunate to have met in this life,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.080
 and then truly then expanding that, connecting with the precious Bodhichitta, thinking that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.800
 this time now and every moment of our lives and all our lives can just only bring fruits

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:04.400
 of benefit for all beings. And then connecting with, again, our closeness feeling, our longing,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.360
 our trust and devotion and joy for our teachers and for the lineage and for towards just the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 true, absolute nature of everything.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:02:12.520
 [Silence]

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.880
 And so, I thought today, just reflect a little bit more, continuing with some thoughts and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.440
 just reflections on the Bodhichitta. And again, I'm here kind of talking, spokesperson, but

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.920
 each one of us, each one of you, we've all had some practice, we've all had some life,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 we've been so graced with receiving so many teachings and we've contemplated them, we've

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 practiced them, so of course the Dharma is so vast, so rich, so just the spirit of my

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 talking is also kind of honoring everyone's realizations and just wishing we all just

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.560
 connect more and more purely, more and more naturally, more and more authentically, joyfully

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.850
 with the true nature, with our relative Bodhichitta, which will usher us to the absolute Bodhichi

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.200
tta

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.720
 realization. And so when we're making our Bodhichitta aspirations, you know, one thing

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.680
 I thought to just reflect a little on is, we say, "From now until attaining the heart

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.400
 of enlightenment." No, no, no, that's our refuge, but from then too, we're going to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.920
 complete the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings. So just thought, we're

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 just again, just remembering, reminding the frame of how do we frame all the infinite

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 mother sentient beings. And then also within Bodhichitta, we've talked to some degree on

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.760
 our aspirational Bodhichitta, but then also talked a little bit more on our actualizing

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:32.400
 Bodhichitta. So who are all these mother sentient parent beings? Like we said before, in the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.360
 teachings, the only difference between fully realized Buddha and ordinary sentient being

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:51.680
 is the degree to which we recognize the nature or not. And that means how caught up we are

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.400
 in the causes of samsara, the causes of suffering, which is what all sentient parent beings because

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 we're not recognizing the nature as it is. And due to that, we're caught up and carried

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.080
 away by our ego clinging, by our grasping and negative emotions, clinging to things

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:30.160
 as being solid, independent, permanent. And then so while we all have the same beautiful

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.520
 absolute true nature of wisdom, love, compassion, which is absolute Bodhichitta, we sentient

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.920
 beings haven't recognized that in different degrees. So who as the objects of our boundless,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.240
 equanimous Bodhichitta, you know, aspiring, connecting with our the four boundless thoughts

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.920
 of all sentient beings having happiness in its causes, being free of suffering and its

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.520
 causes, never being separated from the ultimate happiness, which is completely free of suffering,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.280
 all fulfillments having great joy for all fulfillments, especially the ultimate. And

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:26.960
 then if everyone could be not so caught up in friends and enemies, hopes and fears. So

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.800
 we're going to actualize that. But all these beings, of course, we know we've heard are

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:41.120
 none other than the Buddha classically had the six realms. So we've all again, we've

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.400
 heard about suffering beings, but it's good to think about what are the six realms and

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.000
 what are their causes according to the teachings and there's so many great texts, you know,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.440
 words of my perfect teacher, for example, really goes through in detail, some of the

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.680
 some of the aspects of what beings encounter in the different realms. So I'm not going

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.960
 to spend a lot of time talking about that now, but just kind of briefly go over that.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:23.480
 Right. So what are the six realms? We'll start at the bottom and go to the top. So there's

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:35.360
 what's called the hell realms, which are inhabited by hell beings. There's the hungry ghost realms

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:45.560
 and inhabited by the hungry ghosts, the Yiddah. There's the animal realms and all the animals.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:53.320
 There's the human realm, all the humans, the asuras and the gods. So these are the six

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:01.320
 realms of beings. And then we've also heard in the teachings, right? There's the three

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:15.440
 realms. Do we know what the three realms are? So that's what's known as the desire realm,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.880
 the form realm and the formless realm. And so how do the six classes of beings relate

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:41.200
 to those realms? So in the teachings, the Buddha said actually, the gods are the only

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:54.000
 samsara beings who experience all three realms. The desire realm goes from all the hell realms,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.800
 all the hungry ghost realms, all the human realms, and then a whole bunch of even the

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:07.320
 god realms exist in what's called the desire realm. And what is that? It's mostly perpetuated

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:21.560
 by desire, the form realms, only certain section of the gods inhabit and experience. And those

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:34.240
 are perhaps just more perfect symmetries. The formless realms are again, only the gods,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:40.120
 the formless realms. These are just like it sounds. There's no form. It's kind of the

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:49.960
 result of just really attaining the ability to dwell and abide in the real formless samadis

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.600
 or concentrations. So there's no experience really whatsoever, very subtle. But the main

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.200
 thing with all of these realms is right there in the teachings, we of course we can apply

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:16.440
 it to our own experience. But all these realms, the Buddha taught are as real as rainbows.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:24.360
 That is to say that the hell realm is just as real as this experience we're having right

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:34.320
 now, as well as all the other realms. And so then, you know, there's suffering and there's

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.920
 the causes of suffering. So just quickly going over that in the hell realms, there is many

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:49.520
 sections of the hell realms. There's the hot hells, the cold hells, the kind of more ephemeral

00:10:49.520 --> 00:11:00.280
 boundary hells, but essentially the main suffering of the hell realms is just intense unrelenting

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:14.520
 pain and fear of all kinds of ways and being super sensitive physically and emotionally.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:24.680
 And it's said then too, what are the main causes of experience the hell realms is anger

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:33.160
 within all the poisons we all share acting upon angry hatred thoughts with our body speech

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:42.160
 and mind when they're fully ripened is what we experience in the hell realms. The hungry

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.400
 ghost realms are just like it sounds. The sufferings of the hungry ghost is just never

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:57.320
 getting satisfaction, never having what you want, either due to the capacities of one's

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:05.120
 body and one's mind and perceptions, never at being able to attain something outside

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.560
 that we totally crave and need for our health and happiness or feel we need for our health

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:17.200
 and happiness. So for example, having huge giant bodies with tiny mouths, the sides of

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.160
 pinholes, you know, or always craving being so thirsty and hungry, but when we get to

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.480
 the food or water, it makes us sick or it's evaporated. It's just like those kinds of

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:38.600
 situations. Then the animal realms and the causes, the cause of suffering in the hungry

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:53.800
 ghost is said is what I think are greed and stinginess. The suffering of the animal realms

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:02.520
 is primarily a great degree of not knowing of dullness and being subject to being preyed

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:14.880
 upon and taken advantage of, your body used to sustain others or enslaved to help others

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:24.800
 or being just, you know, preyed upon. And the causes of being born in the animal realm

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:40.000
 are primarily what is said kind of laziness, sleep, just indulging in sleepiness, laziness.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.560
 The human realm. Now that's those three realms too. Again, maybe I'm saying things we all

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:52.880
 know, but again, the main point here is have the frame, but then to really look into those,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.140
 think about those, read more about these things, contemplate them more, bring them into our

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.880
 practice and here specifically our bodhichitta practice, which inhabits every aspect of our

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:14.480
 nundra, bodhichitta. So these three lower realms, hell realms, hungry ghost realm, animal

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.400
 realm, what we talk about when we hear about the lower realms, then there's what's known

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:30.760
 as the higher realms, which are the three other human asura or demi-god and the god realms.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:41.120
 So then again, in the nutshell, the humans, what are we humans, our main suffering? Yeah.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.920
 Well there's a lot of them. We can of course touch on all of these sufferings, but really

00:14:47.920 --> 00:15:00.120
 the main suffering of humans is often doubt, hesitation, poverty mentality, birth, old

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:16.400
 age, sickness, death, busyness, the causes of being born human. I think a lot of good

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:23.920
 deeds because right out of all these realms, it's known as the most favorable because it's

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:37.480
 got a good balance of all these things. In the asuras, the demi-gods, almost gods, their

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:47.040
 main suffering is being racked with jealousy and envy. Jealousy is sometimes too, I was

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:54.200
 looking at, jealousy can be, what's the difference between jealousy and envy? We can apply this

00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.380
 to our own experience. Neither one of them is good. Usually jealousy, there's some sense

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:16.040
 of protecting something we have or think we have, being jealous of losing it. Envy however,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:26.840
 we recognize we don't have it and we want it and we're kind of hate those who have it.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:37.080
 It's not a very happy place to be. And the asuras are full of jealousy. They're always

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.880
 at war with who? With the gods. Who they can perceive some degree of the gods and they

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:59.480
 want what those gods have. They're completely racked with envy and jealousy for what they

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.600
 have. And then the god realms. Of course, and then again, there's different levels that

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:15.220
 go even up into the form and formless, but the gods have very enjoyable experiences.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:24.540
 Desire realm, form realm, formless realm. There's no suffering until the very end. So it said

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:34.760
 the suffering of the gods is when all of their positive karma has ripened and been exhausted

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:41.760
 and now the end of their life has come. So the god realms are very pleasant but they're

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:54.080
 not liberation. So one's beautiful body begins to smell and sweat and age. One's beautiful

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:00.840
 blossoms as far as this desire realm start to fade. All of our friends run away. And

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:09.320
 then through our clairvoyance and our wider vision of relative truth, we also can perceive

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.860
 what's happening. Waking up from the spell of all of the wonderful life we've had and

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:24.840
 see how we've exhausted and where we're going due to our next karma is that will ripen.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.720
 Which because often it's set in the god realms, it's exhausted, we then fall down to the lower

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:41.920
 realms. So the suffering of the gods is called falling down. The cause of being in the god

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:56.720
 realm is sometimes they say pride and arrogance. So we can look a lot more at those sufferings

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.760
 but just beginning to just use those as little simple frames to really get specific and not

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:15.840
 have sentient beings just be abstract. Who is the object of compassion? All of us are.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.540
 And so many others that we have no idea are there but due to the omniscience and kindness

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:28.820
 of the Buddha kind of introducing us to this view that there's more, there's just an ocean

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:38.240
 of samsara there, right? And samsara is a no-win situation. There's temporary comforts and

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:44.520
 relief in samsara but no final resting place. It's like trying to they say trying to find

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:55.840
 comfort on the head of a pin. So we aspire to generate our bodhicitta to realize the

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:04.540
 absolute bodhicitta, the heart of enlightenment, the mind of enlightenment, our Buddha nature

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:12.480
 in order to truly be a benefit to others. So we actualize that through what we call

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:21.440
 the six paramitas. And of course they're so renowned. All of the relative actualizing

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:29.920
 bodhicitta path is all contained within the six paramitas. And then just two paramita

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:41.480
 gets translated to transcendental perfections of generosity, transcendental perfection of

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:49.840
 morality, transcendental perfection of patience, transcendental perfection of joyful effort,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:57.600
 the perfection of concentration, transcendental perfection of wisdom. But that transcendental,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:05.040
 I think the main thing to really connect with in our mind and heart is it's transcendental

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.560
 because we're not so caught up in ourselves. We're really trying to upturn the cause of

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:21.920
 suffering for ourselves and others, which is what it all comes back to our ignorance of

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:29.800
 how things are and more fundamentally are being caught up with our grasping and our

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:39.200
 to negative emotions, all the causes of the six realms and upturning them through those

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.360
 things. So, you know, one thing to just to remember as we're doing our bodhicitta section

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:56.840
 of the nundra, we're, we're making our bodhicitta vow in that one section, but keeping bodhicitta,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:05.560
 the supreme bodhicitta, it's the heart of all the Dharma. It's without it, where would

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:19.440
 we be? We'd have no Buddha, we'd have no teachings that show us the way to our own

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:26.800
 nature. So from now until samsara becomes empty, I shall accomplish the benefits and

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.680
 happiness of all sentient parent beings. So that is in essence is right perfecting the

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:39.520
 six paramitas, which is turning our ego. So one thing just to remember is this renowned

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:48.840
 practice of Tonglen is also really getting to that heart of Tonglen exchanging our own

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:57.160
 happiness, giving away all of our happiness, receiving all the suffering of others. Because

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:05.240
 right that's kind of the opposite of what we're inclined to do. So like practicing Tonglen

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:13.320
 as we're doing our bodhicitta practice is one thing we can do. And so, you know, there's

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:19.940
 different ways of doing the Tonglen practice, you know, one really classic way is where

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:27.040
 we're again, we're riding the breath. So as we exhale, we're giving away all happiness.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.340
 And we can see that as like bright light, just going out, pervading all these vast realms

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:45.180
 of samsara going to every single individual being who's a whole universe. And then we're,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:52.320
 as we breathe in, we're absorbing all the suffering and the causes of suffering of every

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.360
 single one of those infinite sentient beings. And they sometimes they say picturing that

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:07.600
 as just like, you know, just black mass, we're just absorbing, inhaling it all. And then

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:14.080
 exhaling just all of our all the virtues we have all of the happiness we've had in this

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.720
 in all our lives, giving that to all beings absorbing. And then didn't don't go can't

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.240
 save him, but she had beautiful description to that. That's like, that's like picturing

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.480
 all these beings kind of lost in the fog and the mist. And it's like, it just evaporates

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:40.680
 and they're in the pure, clear sight. I'm gonna absorb that. And then really taking

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:47.600
 in that suffering, see what that's like. But another aspect of that we can really kind

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.520
 of connect, but look to that suffering, look to where it is, how it is, where is it, you

00:24:53.520 --> 00:25:01.480
 know, applying those instructions. But also we can then also just picture. It's almost

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:10.400
 like our bodhicitta is like a vast infinite sun. So as we're exhaling that light, that

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.220
 grace, that joy, freedom, peace, all good qualities, all the fulfillments, temporary

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:23.720
 and ultimate, just awakening and all the confusion, just evaporating from all the minds and hearts

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:31.420
 of every single living being. And then we're absorbing all of that black mass of suffering

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:40.240
 and its causes. But then too, letting that just be like a drop of rain on the face of

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:52.000
 the sun, as far as our emptiness awareness, just using that visualization to taking on

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.760
 all the illusory suffering. And then there's other forms of, you know, we can expand just

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.820
 as the pure light, but also they say to something in the teaching picture ourselves, we just

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:10.920
 visualize ourselves as a wish fulfilling jewel, you know, with the crown ornaments, just able

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:18.080
 to fulfill all the wishes of every single being. And put in that skillful means of the

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.720
 bodhicitta, which means every wish is fulfilled, that only connects beings with true happiness

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:35.840
 and peace. Or emanate as many bodies as we can into every realm, bringing peace and protection,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:45.680
 you know, and exchanging that way. Or just, you know, just, we can just totally use our

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:52.520
 imagination. Like Shantay Deva says, let me be a bridge, a boat, a medicine, just really

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:59.120
 use our imagination to actualize our bodhicitta. Think about, for example, you know, like going

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:07.760
 and giving protection to all of the beings who are being, you know, preyed upon or attacked,

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.520
 giving them perfect protection, or emanating as the perfect medicine for all incurable

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:21.080
 diseases and all sickness, just appearing in the lives of beings, really being the true

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.400
 medicine to bring healing, even though it's temporary. But again, through our bodhicitta,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:35.760
 that means we're connecting all beings with liberation, you know, emanating to free all

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:44.040
 of the beings enslaved and ensnared by their own self cast spells, or being, you know,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:58.440
 imprisoned or captured in any way, being free, but free in the best of ways. So it goes on

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.720
 and on, but just really using, you know, thinking about as we're doing our bodhicitta practice,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.160
 using some of these instructions we've received on just kind of tonglen or kind of actualizing

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.900
 our bodhicitta. Then of course, that's within the frame of our nundra practice itself. But

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:25.240
 keeping that spirit of loving kindness, that's what it all boils down to openness and open

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:36.960
 mind and open heart, trying to be appropriate as we're in the world, just keeping our bodhicitta

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:45.960
 commitment there and looking to when we start to lose it, finding that boundary point between

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:51.640
 when we lose our mindfulness and our alertness and our conscientiousness, when we start to

00:28:51.640 --> 00:29:02.600
 space out and get caught up in our negative emotions, being aware of that place and letting

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:09.160
 it take us as much as our practice.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:17.440
 So that's enough talking. Now we'll just do our practice. So yeah, the main point bodhicitta,

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:24.800
 the heart of enlightenment, it's the source of all the Dharma. It's our very true nature.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:32.640
 Because on the absolute level, bodhicitta is our Buddha nature. And we're all again, we're

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:40.840
 purifying, we're removing our obscurations and their causes, bringing out our bodhicitta,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:47.600
 using generating our bodhicitta through the beautiful skillful means of our relative bodhicitta,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:56.440
 our aspiration and our actualizing. And it's not going to be perfect when we start, but

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:03.000
 that's the path. But keeping with it, keeping our courage, our commitment, means our joy,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:11.440
 our devotion, really mingling our mind with the mind of enlightenment with the guru, listening

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:23.040
 to our wisdom, letting ourselves rest in just no thought and the no thought bodhicitta too.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.480
 When we're really connecting with our bodhicitta, it's one of the benefits. It's pervading us

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.480
 at all times. We can use our imagination and engage with our intellect with bodhicitta

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:41.720
 motivation, but also like really having it be heartfelt and just an atmosphere that's

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:49.080
 pervading. It begins to be inseparable from our renunciation. It becomes inseparable from

00:30:49.080 --> 00:31:02.720
 our devotion. They're all mingled. We'll do our practice now. We'll just rest for a few

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.400
 moments in silence and then we'll begin our nundra.
