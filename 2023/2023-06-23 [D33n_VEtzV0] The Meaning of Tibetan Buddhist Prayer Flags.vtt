00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I talked a little bit about the prayer flags. I mean, you all know. Every year I talk almost the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.840
 same thing.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:14.000
 And many of you who came here, I'm sure you heard this so often there. But I talk with fundamental

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.880
 levels. Fundamental level, this prayer play is accumulated merit. Accumulated merit. And again,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.280
 in the Buddha teaching often said, "To reach enlightenment, we have to purify our

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.800
 obscurations and habit dependence and accumulate the merit." So when we accumulate the merit,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.200
 that means the virtues, merit is, that incidentally removes the obscurations,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.440
 habit dependence. Particularly this prayer flag or the lung dai is very powerful in the teaching

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.230
 method. It's connected with wind. In Buddhism, and particularly in Vedic teaching, why are we

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.480
 really

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 going through all this samsara, all these emotions? Well, first of all, we're going in the samsara.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.480
 Second, well, in this samsara, why all these so many emotions, almost unstable emotions,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:26.560
 arising in our mind or our brains or wherever it is arising. Who is really activating that?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.600
 According to Vedic and Buddhism, it's wind. Our wind is, wind means moving force,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.000
 moving. So it's really moving all the time. Nonstop is moving. In the teaching often said,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.760
 mind itself is calm, peaceful, but mind is connected with wind and therefore mind is constantly

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.120
 moving and restless and particularly for us with the lateral habit dependence. And then

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.000
 it just drives us all different directions, the emotions, such as anger, jealous, heavy thought,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 emotions, doubt and hesitation, the depression. I mean, it's really one after another. All

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 combination is that happening. So therefore, to remove that, to pacify that is so important.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.800
 And for those reasons, the teaching said, using the wind energy to purify, to calm down the wind,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 negative winds. So this is like as a homeopathic systems, use the wind and to dispel and calm down

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.920
 the bad wind. So therefore this lunga is very considerate, very powerful practices.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.240
 And then as I said, also it does. What it does, it accumulates the merits. Merits mean,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.680
 generally in Buddhism, often we heard that cause and condition and the result.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 And we want to get nice, good results. That everybody loves a good result. We all love that.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 But we have to think good cause, cause for that. Without a cause, there is no good result.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.440
 Or without a good cause, there is no good result. It really goes side by side, side by side.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.570
 Therefore, everyone to have the good result, we have to be smart with the good cause and conditions

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.720
.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:41.120
 So good cause and the condition is also no other than, again, our own mind. Our own mind

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.800
 bring more vicious thoughts, more kindness, more compassion, more love and body. Somebody

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:57.680
 tells, then whatever we do, if we accumulate the merit and that will also dispel the obscurations.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.120
 And particularly these lunga is a skillful means of practices in Vadiyana Buddhism.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.000
 Say that is really taught that because of this wind horse, when we're raising in the wind horse,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.200
 which what means actually raising of the wind horse, we're raising up the sleeping of our courage.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:26.640
 We're raising our sleeping commitment. We're raising our self-streams. Then at the bottom

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.800
 down, we're raising up and glorifying our Buddha nature, our own nature, present our nature,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.400
 of the Buddha nature, you know, that really kind of dreamed by all those happy patterns,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.600
 unnecessary and unhealthy things. So, but we that this prayer is really known as

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.000
 to raising up those all our courage, commitment, self-stream, confidence,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.280
 and that we need to raise up that. If we raise up the confidence and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.560
 glorious and courage and commitment, if we act with that, then the things, all the wishes really

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.840
 comes, a current teaching, it will come slowly or maybe not so fast, but it will come that because

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.480
 we are lined up toward that direction. And somehow we demolish it, discourage it, and kind of like

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.120
 our self is lower down on the door and then disappointment, all those aiding, all one after

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.000
 another, and then it really dragged down as our glorious, our successful, our kind of goodness,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.520
 everything is going down. So, therefore, this wind horse practice is along that in a little bit,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.360
 the raising of that qualities is so important. I thought, again, I said this raising of this

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:54.160
 wind horse is courage, commitment, confidence, and self-streams, and visions, although what's

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.560
 in the West called the dream, we really try to activate our future dreams, present dreams,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.280
 in the sense of the more calm and peaceful, beneficial ways. So, therefore, this raising

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.600
 of the wind horse is so important. And then also this wind horse is all practice, the teachings of

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.680
 the Buddha, Shakyamuni, Gurbama, Sambhava. Sambhava, so it's very, very special. And color is also

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.800
 connected with our elements and fire, water, wind, earth, also in the teaching said. And what

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.840
 blue is represented, connected to the sky elements or space. And then white is connected to the

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.240
 water

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.920
 elements. Yellow is connected to the earth elements. And red is more connected with the

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.760
 fire elements. And then as well as the green is more connected with the wind element. So, we are

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:58.800
 refining to put those colors and to refine our inner five qualities. That means also these five

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.360
 elements are connected to the five wisdom and such as Dharma Datta wisdom, Meru like wisdom,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.840
 as well as the equanimity of wisdom, and all discrimination, awareness of wisdom,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.240
 and all a complicated wisdom. Five wisdom is connected. So, that means we're raising up these

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.640
 energies and with a good heart or body to the thought. And then not just for us, but its benefit

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.560
 for all beings really. And the teaching said it is so powerful because when you raise up the wind,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.040
 this prayer flies. That means according to the teaching said, wind printing this mantra,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.120
 these prayers each time it printed and their ketties that printed that malakus or printed

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:53.120
 that particles of the syllables on the mantras ketties all over the world, it goes space to

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.640
 everywhere. So therefore, it is also according to the teaching, it is really so benefited to the

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.960
 old,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.040
 all the beings to the elements to everyone. And then also it is glorifying according to the

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.800
 teaching is glorified and also it's kind of giving the courage and commitment and glorifying to all

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.840
 the invisible mainstream. According to Buddhism, in a particular way and teaching, there are so

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.160
 many

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.800
 invisibles everywhere. And there are also really many times having a lot of difficulty challenges.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.520
 But when we do prayer, raise up the prayer, it becomes a great healing and a support to their

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.160
 intention, their wishes to perform the good things. So they become more friendly, more harmonious,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.560
 more relaxed, and that will affect us too and bring more peace and happiness and harmonious

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.360
 to the 80 or to the country, to the world. So I mean, it is really very, very special and very

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.400
 powerful. And this time, many of those, as I say, it is the Buddha's teaching and Gurbama Sambha

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.840
 and Vayayana also like those prayers and put all together and the symbols of their

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.360
 four symbols. I think horse in the middle, horse in the middle, many times illustrations

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.880
 put the horse in the middle, which symbolize this acid, bodhicata with the

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:23.360
 unsleeping bodhicata or very actively engaging bodhicata to all beings. That's symbolized by

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.720
 horse. In the Tibetan or Asian times, horse is mostly kind of like positive ones,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:36.640
 like quick ones. So therefore, even say the swept horse, the miracle horse, and the witch is that,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.520
 and that is carried into the witch, fulfilling jewels, fulfilling all the wishes. So that means

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:53.520
 fulfilling all the wishes by the poor activities, pacifically, pacifying and increasing activities

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:00.560
 to benefit of all the sentient beings. And there is lines, there is the Tagas, there is Garudas,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:11.200
 there is the Dagans. And these lines and the Dagans, sorry, lines and the Tagas symbolize

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:20.400
 the more kind of power, majesty of the earth. And Garuda and the Dagans symbolize majesty of the

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:28.160
 skies. So earth and the skies have become more archivicious and harmonious and kind of

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.120
 re-stanting, re-activating the energy of the earth and the planet and the human beings.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:42.320
 Those are really symbolized. And pacifically, we talk that Tagas symbolize magnificent glories,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:51.680
 and the lines symbolize as a fearless state of the courage and fearless status. And then,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:59.360
 and the Dagans symbolize repetition in the frames, repetition in the frames of the renowned ones.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.080
 And Garuda symbolize the power and the speech, speed and quick, quick ones. So those are like

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:13.200
 kind of two symbols, put those symbols with it, with the prayer and raising of the prayer fellows.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.480
 And those are really in the teaching state, so powerful and a beneficially and a particularly

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.160
 in our time. It's also springtime and not just springtime, but according to the Buddhism, it is

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.360
 now, now the miracle month, miracle month Sagadawada, where the bodhicakamini got enlightenment,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.040
 protect the bird, got enlightenment in Mahaparin nirvana, and all that happened. If we look

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.000
 carefully,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.800
 this in the 12 activities of the Buddhas, at least five activities he performed in this,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:54.880
 during this month. And the first is birth, second is enlightenment, and the third is Mahaparin nir

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:54.960
vana.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.440
 But before enlightenment, always in the teaching state, one of the activities is walking,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.560
 traveling the bodhi, bodhi tree. That's happening this month. And while he is meditating under the

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:17.040
 bodhi tree, and the next activity is called defeat in all the Mahas, all the Mahas, and that also

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:26.400
 happened this month. Then enlightenment, and then Mahaparin nirvana. So it's this. And in a way,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:34.640
 all the activities of the Narmakaya, Sambokaya, also happened at these times. And kind of more

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.760
 principle, Dharmakaya, meditating Dharmakaya, also in this happened. So among these two kyas,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.960
 Rupakaya and Dharmakaya, all that really in an act. Of course, the Buddha is always in that state.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.480
 There's no doubt, but external level every save. That all he demonstrated within this month. So

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:03.820
 therefore, according to the Buddhism, is considered one of the very sacred and holiest month at

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.000
 that

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.560
 time. Any meditry activity will do. It will be multiplied with good intention, good medicine.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:17.280
 So it's powerful. That means it's meditry is multiplied. That means also is purifying

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.920
 the negativities, our obscurations, obstacles. So therefore it is just really everywhere is so

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.800
 powerful and so special. And again, thank you very much for again, participating and coming. Okay.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.360
 Thank you, everyone. Okay. And that's my brief kind of talk about that. And now we do that

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.640
 blessings of this, this brave place. And then you all help us to raise up this. I mean, this is all

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:50.560
 came so many efforts. Rama, Lorraine, and all the Sangha members really made this so much effort to

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:57.680
 get these things. And we have that. So now really, you will all help and support to raise up. And

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:57.920
 then

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.920
 it's just the final goal of this brave place. So thank you again. Okay. Thank you, everyone. Thank

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.720
 you.
