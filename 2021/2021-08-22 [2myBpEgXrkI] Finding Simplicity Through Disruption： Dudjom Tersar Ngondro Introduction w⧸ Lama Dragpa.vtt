00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.860
 Warm greetings, friends. Thanks for joining. Thank you all. So if we all just take a moment

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.640
 to refresh and really reconnect to our motivation of Bodhichitta and really try to strongly bring

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 out this wish that what we're doing now, reflecting on the teachings and putting them into practice

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.120
,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.580
 that this very moment and this time together becomes the cause of the happiness and enlightenment

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:59.400
 of all beings everywhere. So we'll just refresh that motivation and that view just for a few

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:19.980
 minutes.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:31.220
 So there's a single moment that we're all heading towards. And that's the moment of

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 dying. So Buddhists tend to not shy away from this too much because the Buddha taught so

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.560
 much about impermanence. And this is a very big impermanence that each of us have to go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:00.140
 through eventually. And the real certain thing about dying for each of us is that it is going

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:10.940
 to happen soon. The older I get, which is just little by little, and when I talk with

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.740
 friends who are older than me, for a lot of them it seems like time passes faster as they

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:27.700
 get older. And there's a sense of where did it all go? It happened so fast. So this big

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:37.100
 disruption is coming. And we know it. Kind of on the surface of our brains, we kind of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.960
 have that knowledge. This time's coming. This moment's coming. And essentially kind of what

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:59.540
 is this moment? It's really the big loss of control. Where we can't control our body,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 we can't control where we're at, who's around us. Since faculties start getting jittery.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.940
 And I'm no expert by any means on this moment of death. I don't know anything about it.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.100
 I'm scared about it. I fear that big disruption. But the one thing the Buddha taught that was

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.840
 really clear about death is that same process of dissolution or dying is the very same process

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.740
 that's happening right now. As one moment moves into the next, as our thoughts become

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.540
 new thoughts, our emotions become new emotions, as the seasons change, as the days go by,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.900
 as we fall asleep and then wake up, it's basically the same sequence of cause and effect happening.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.020
 And in one way, we can look at this as a big problem. This constantly being disrupted,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:15.620
 interrupted. That I'm trying to have kind of control over this experience and find some

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.420
 sense of happiness and a sense of purpose and well-being. And it keeps getting interrupted

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:31.740
 by life happening to me. That I can't control. And then the big disruption of, "Oh, I can't

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.540
 move. Oh, everything's happening. Oh, everything's shutting down." Then what do I have control

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:50.020
 over then? It's my mind. That's it. And the Buddha taught this same situation is happening

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 right now. The only thing I really have conscious control over is my mind. If I train it, if

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.980
 I investigate it, if I look closely at what is this awareness happening right now, right

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:19.980
 now, what is going on in my mind? That's where there's control. We have very conscious ability

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:29.300
 to choose how we engage with this experience, this world that's really out of our control.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.660
 So samsara is this process that's completely infallible, this sequence of cause and effect.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.900
 And it's like a perfect infinite machine that there's not an error. It's like infallible.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.540
 But the problem is there's so many moving parts. And we only see a piece of it. And so

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:01.380
 all the things we don't see of cause and effect, they feel like we're getting hurt, or we're

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.020
 losing control, or we're disrupted, or what we want to happen isn't happening, or what

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.020
 we didn't want to happen happens. And it's because we have a little window of what we're

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.340
 paying attention to of this vast sequence of cause, conditions, and effects. And so you

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.620
 could say, like, in one way, samsara is this perfect, intricate system of cause and effect

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:31.260
 that never misses a beat. But experience from my small view, it feels like it's uninterrupted

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.180
 disruptions or interruptions of what I want to happen. Again and again and again, I don't

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.220
 get what I want. I feel tired. I feel annoyed. The weather, it rained on my parade, whatever.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:52.500
 Or something really bad happened. It's really very tragic. It's genuinely just heartbreaking.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 So suffering, samsara is suffering. I mean, nowadays, maybe it'd be like we could define

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:10.260
 that in a way. Samsara is traumatic. It's this endless, ongoing repetition of being

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:21.180
 hurt, being wounded, of me getting hurt. And so then the task for each of us as practitioners,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.580
 if we consider ourselves practitioners, we're trying to study, contemplate, and practice

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:31.780
 as Buddhists within the Buddhist teachings, according to the guidance of the Buddha and

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.680
 the lineage masters and our personal teacher. Then there's two ways we can utilize this

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.300
 disruption of life, of each moment becoming a new moment. And we don't know what's really

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.820
 going to happen. We really don't know. Because we don't see big enough. We don't see enough

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.420
 of the causes, conditions, and effects closely enough. So we keep getting the rug pulled

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:02.660
 out from under us. Because we just don't see clearly enough yet. And there's two options.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:14.680
 We can use practice to disrupt our old negative habits. Or we can let our old negative habits

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:23.900
 disrupt our practice. I'm assuming that people have received some Dharma teachings before

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.820
 hearing this. So we have some teachings under our belts. We know some basic Buddha's fundamentals,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.620
 the Four Noble Truths, and bodhicitta, and we're coming to an Andro session. And I mean,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.500
 there's such a wealth of Dharma teachings out there. We have all these tools. So we

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.700
 can use these tools. We can use these views in this system, this guidance from these sublime

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.660
 immaculate beings who actually gained complete conscious attention of all causes, conditions,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:58.780
 and effects. They became enlightened. We can use their guidance and their tools to completely

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:06.500
 disrupt our old negative habits, the habit of me against everything. And little by little,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:13.260
 we can ease up that mistaken perception. It's not me versus everything. I'm a big part of

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.740
 this fast flowing system. And so are you. Each of us are. We're not against it. We're

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.780
 always with it. But when we take a small piece of it and try to hold on to it in a stuck

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.900
 fixed way, it seems like everything's against us. So we can use these tools, these instructions

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.820
 in this guidance and Nundra practice. And each day, each moment, if we get really kind

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.260
 of like burned with our hair on fire to really want to use this situation to disrupt our

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:48.500
 old negative habits that keep causing us suffering, sense of being harmed, we can use this to

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:55.460
 completely interrupt and finally break through all of our old destructive habits that we

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:02.580
 ourselves have ingrained again and again and again over a long period of time. Or we can

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:09.100
 kind of use, you know, not use the techniques in the practice and kind of like get bored

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.220
 with them or take them for granted or kind of just, you know, it can become another thing

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:20.380
 we do, you know, the practice can be another way that I, you know, another badge I have,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.700
 which is spiritual materialism. It can be another way that I avoid dealing with my life.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.380
 We can be a bypassing thing. One more way where I'm not actually going to intend to

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.820
 like what's going on in me, my emotions and my thoughts. Oh, I'll just practice now and

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:44.580
 not deal with the emotion stuff that's happening. Or we can avoid it, avoid our pain, avoid

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.020
 the suffering of samsara with practice. Or we can use our practice to actually look at

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.940
 the suffering. How is this working? Why, what is going on in this moment of my mind suffering

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:05.460
 now? And we can disrupt the tense grasping mind onto this pain and this suffering and

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:14.900
 this big drama that I have really a lot invested in. And so we're very fortunate as Buddhist

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:23.580
 practitioners. We have this in all these systems of techniques that when things really break

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:32.580
 down, we don't have to break down to. We can really break through. We can use a disruption,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:43.380
 use an interruption instead of breaking down and getting more broken. We can use it to

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:50.580
 break through that sense of like, why isn't this going my way? And instead we can listen

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:58.020
 like what is happening now can really look clearly. And we can develop this ability more

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:06.860
 and more over time to this surrender. We can surrender ourselves to the teachings. So the

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.260
 teachings become something that we merge with little by little, not that we have as another

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.940
 tool, not as another, just another thing happening in our life. So it becomes our life that really

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.620
 try to blend our life with Dharma over time, little by little by little over a long period

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.820
 of time, because we have a lot of old habits that we have to loosen. We have a lot of new

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:40.380
 good habits we need to cultivate. And we have a lot of relaxing to do. Don't we? I do. Because

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:46.180
 I'm constantly trying to set up the perfect thing. And then Oh, it doesn't happen. Or I

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:58.460
 fall asleep. And then I wake up a new day. Oh, no, it's not over. So those are cancer

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.220
 which he said something that was really helpful in a teaching called it depends years ago

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:11.860
 from New York City. He said the basic definition of a bodhisattva view is there's no finish

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:23.940
 line. We give up the idea of just wanting to be done with it all. Instead, we've really

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.900
 curiously look at it, we try to open it up, we see, wow, this is really incredible and

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:37.700
 amazing what's happening here. And all these beings are just so hurting. Aren't they? When

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.060
 we look out, I mean, all it is is just constantly just look in any portal of looking through

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:52.500
 the world. There's so much hurt. And people who really need support, you know, not really.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:03.780
 There's so much distress. There's so much samsara in samsara. And we can use these teachings

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:10.100
 to break through our habits to try to avoid it all. Or to be overwhelmed by it. Or just

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:16.380
 shut down and close off. We can use the teachings to actually lean into it. This is the courageous

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:29.260
 bodhisattva view. Little by little, little baby bodhisattvas. Little, little, baby bodhisattvas.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.300
 We're trying to develop our capacities for bigger view, for more courage, more courage,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:43.020
 more strength, more laughter. More deep heartache that actually, like, really practically in

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.020
 really grounded ways is what can I do to help? What's available to me? How can I help you?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:57.100
 How can I relieve your suffering? Even if it's practice, right? It doesn't have to just

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.740
 be money or tangible. It doesn't have to be everything in the degenerate age now is tangible.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:11.700
 It's very obvious. Like death. Death is big, obvious disruption. But all these micro moments

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.100
 of disruption, of interruption, of all these things where the ego doesn't get its way,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.900
 doesn't get its way, doesn't get its way. Oh, then it really doesn't get its way. And

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.940
 then we can break down and freak out. Or we can relax and actually apply the teachings

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:34.280
 that we've been given. So that's kind of all available for us now. And there's no way around

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.060
 doing it little by little, like each moment renews itself and each time of each moment

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.900
 of mind. We have the opportunity to start again, start new, be fresh, fresh, fresh. And

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:51.180
 that's disrupting this old habits. Same old, same old, same old, new, same old, same old,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.540
 same old. There's nothing new under the sun. I'm little old me. This is just a bad, big

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:05.280
 bad world. We can disrupt that and interrupt that and see a little more clearly. So as

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.540
 Buddhists, we're very fortunate. We have this giant spectrum of teachings the Buddha gave,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.180
 these fundamental teachings. And the thing now is we can use these tiny disruptions now,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.540
 like day going into night and night going into day. These little interruptions of things

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.780
 happening that we don't like. Oh, I have a foot ache. Oh, I have a bad mood come up.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.380
 Oh, someone said something. We can use these little things that rub us and kind of little,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:37.420
 they're like little bits of suffering. They're not so overwhelming. And then we can use that

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:44.100
 to train our mind a little bit of a friction. And then we can, ha, what did the Buddha say?

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.980
 What did my teacher say? What teachings have I received? And gradually with these little

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:56.700
 interruptions or disruptions, we can retrain our minds. We don't need to wait for a big

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.060
 disruption to happen before we actually do some preparation. Right now, when it's a little

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.060
 easier, when a little more is on our side, we can train ourselves and open ourselves

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.100
 and connect to our compassion and our love and our kindness and our gratitude for these

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:22.460
 lineage teachings. So in a basic way, it says, if today's the day to die, am I ready? And

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:28.140
 we can ask ourselves that, am I ready today? And the Buddha said we should ask ourselves

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.340
 that. These great Zen practitioners, every night they turn clean out their eating bowl,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.340
 turn it upside down, set up their surroundings. So if they die that night, everything's nice

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.300
 and refreshed for the next person to come in and use their things. And there's no need

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:49.180
 to make a big fuss over all the loose strands they left around. They leave it clean. And

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.880
 we can do that with our practice, doing this nundro, doing regular practice, reconnecting

00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:00.260
 to our motivation in simple, simple ways that make such a big difference over time. So what

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:05.740
 are the fundamentals? If all of a sudden I never saw a Dharma book again, if all of a

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:11.900
 sudden there was no Sangha around, if all of a sudden it was my mind started getting

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:18.580
 little like, you know, fuzzier, can't remember the names as well. I don't really remember

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:25.340
 when that happened. You know, this is life, right? Do I know enough Dharma that in this

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:36.420
 day, today, if I go, am I ready? So what are the fundamentals? And that's what nundro is

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:43.900
 all about. We put the time in to really get a supple flexibility that's really kind of

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.860
 rooted in there of like the fundamentals of Buddha Dharma. Foundation of Buddhism, Sutra

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.700
 Mahayana, Tantra Mahayana, again and again and again and again. We touch base with these

00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:04.440
 fundamentals, four noble truths, four mind turnings, kindness, renouncing causes of suffering.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:11.920
 Sutra Mahayana, bodhicitta, relative bodhicitta, four balanced thoughts, six parameter practices,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:19.220
 absolute bodhicitta, lack of intrinsic inherent existence, going beyond all conceptual designations

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:31.700
 and limitations. Tantra Mahayana, pure perception, devotion, deep abiding, close feeling to the

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.140
 lineage, to the teaching, to the teachers, to the Buddha, to the Dharma, to the Sangha.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:44.900
 A deep trust in ourselves, Vajra pride, a complete certainty conviction that this is

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:53.000
 good. I am good. You are good. This is workable. And then in more tantrics, you know, scenario

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.260
 or kind of languaging, there's nothing to be done. It's nothing to be fixed. It is all

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:06.180
 completely achieved. It's done. There's no fire to put out. This utter resolute conviction

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.500
 in the purity of everything. I don't have any of these fundamentals, but these are basic

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:18.700
 fundamentals. We've heard them so many times from our very kind and precious amazing extraordinary

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:25.060
 teachers. And in their book, Illuminating the Path, and His Holiness Dhujhir Rinpoche,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:31.080
 Jujhir Yashidorje's book, On a Torch Lighting the Way to Freedom, all these nundra instructions,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.740
 we have them right at our fingertips and we can utilize them. These fundamentals are,

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.100
 really all these masters have just repeated these time and again. And it's what they'll

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:47.660
 keep repeating. Fundamental means essential. So like when things get shaky and something

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.820
 gets disrupted and something gets interrupted, what are the fundamentals? Because if it's

00:20:53.820 --> 00:21:02.220
 not just if emotionally or if like in a more kind of intuitive or embodied sense, if I'm

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.980
 not yet in a flexible relaxed state that's not fight flight freeze or whatever, but it's

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:14.260
 more like, ooh, something new. If I haven't yet developed that kind of training, which

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:20.340
 I haven't, then cognitively, conceptually, intellectually, according to a study, study

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.820
 and contemplation, intellectual, what are the frameworks that I really need to reactivate

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:33.060
 now? If I'm freaking out, what are the basics? Because the Buddha taught all of them. And

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.500
 I just went through as a quick list and like, we'll hear, hopefully if we're so fortunate,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.500
 years and years and years, more on these teachings, unpacking them and connecting with one another

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.580
 to really bring these alive, to light ourselves up with these same fundamental teachings,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.620
 bhorichitta, renunciation, pure perception. Every time a teaching begins, same fundamentals,

00:21:52.620 --> 00:22:02.350
 just like Lama Lai said last week, same fundamentals. We need to have them become so rote, so

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.540
 habitual

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.380
 that it's just like, we're right and ready. Something bad happens. We don't know what

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:13.900
 to do. They can just, they're right there. Like as practitioners, we really need to kind

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.100
 of take that on as a challenge. What are the fundamentals, even just intellectually, that

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.420
 right now, if I die today, bring this to my mind, bring this to my mind, connect in this

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:33.500
 way, release this, let go of that, forgive, relax. And then we apply them. And that's

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.820
 what we're doing all of these sessions. The beautiful thing of Buddha Dharma is it's an

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:45.380
 entire system that has all these fundamentals that work together. And as our mind opens

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:54.380
 up and refines, the system opens up and refines. And in the end, the system dissolves itself.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:59.500
 In the end, we become the Dharma. The Dharma is not there, and we're here. The Dharma is

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.900
 how we are, because that's what the nature is, because eventually we're just natural

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:15.060
 and we go with it. We don't need a system anymore once we become fully natural or enlightened.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:22.100
 So in the meantime, on the path, there's all these steps. And step one of this nundra path,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.300
 of course, we have to turn our mind to be interested in these things. We're so kind,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:32.220
 the Buddha said, there's a problem here. Suffering. That was so kind of the Buddha. So many people

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:37.780
 don't admit the problem. It's so refreshing to hear an honest, straightforward admission.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:43.980
 It's just something's really wrong, you know? What can I do? Then he says, all these things

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:53.940
 we can do. What can I rely on? Whatever change happens, change, change, change, change, change.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:02.020
 What can I rely on? What is the reliable refuge? What will protect my baby bodhicitta? Because

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:10.020
 I need to protect my little cute, sweet baby bodhicitta. It's so little cute, baby bodhicitta,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.300
 but it's such a little baby. And that needs to be touched. It needs to be cared for and

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:20.660
 fed properly. And it needs to go to bed on time and all the things. It needs regularity.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.540
 It needs protection. It needs security. Not in a sense of exclusivity. Oh, this is the

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.220
 only path. Oh, this is the best path. Oh, my way is the right way. Nothing like that.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.780
 But for me right now, for my little tiny baby bodhicitta, oh, this is what it really needs

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:43.300
 to be soothed, to be encouraged, to be challenged just enough that it can take on, that it can

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:50.000
 grow, that it can learn to adapt. This system keeps correcting itself, right? Remember what

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.820
 she said the other day? What is a dharma? To correct. To hold ourself in one way, and

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:07.220
 this is just, I'm extrapolating, to hold ourself accountable. We are fundamentally good. This

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.560
 situation is workable. I have so much to offer the world, and so do you, and so do all of

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.900
 us, and we need to help each other, and we need to learn from each other, and we need

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:23.940
 to work together. And we can use this, all this imbalance, the fragility of samsara,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.700
 we can use this to our advantage to completely break through this habitual mind that keeps

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:38.260
 obsessing over what it can't control. And so it looks out, and looks out, and looks out.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.820
 And just, I forget, to look, what's my mind? What is my awareness doing now? I have full

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:49.580
 conscious capacity to change its direction now, to actually go for refuge in something

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:59.340
 reliable. Buddha dharma sangha. Turn my mind towards that, and then to keep looking. Not

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.300
 just look once, or look a few times, or look, and then feel like I've looked enough, and

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.340
 then forget, and then just take for granted and gloss over. But to keep it fresh and active.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.500
 This contemplation, different masters have said this, study, contemplation, wisdom of

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.700
 meditation, study, contemplation, meditation. For a lot of us, the one that's most weak

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:26.820
 is contemplation. We start with saying, I don't know, you know, help me, I want to learn.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.480
 So we study, we receive teachings, we hear, we listen. We want to get to the point in

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.740
 meditation where we have a clear conviction of a fresh wakefulness, regardless of what's

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:44.300
 happening. That's certainty wisdom. That's what we're aiming for. That's what each session

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.740
 we try to, we dissolve the refuge tree into ourselves, and we just try to abide in complete

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:56.620
 certainty wisdom of the nature. So every session undoes itself, and we just are left free and

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:04.920
 easy and open and fresh. The toolbox dissolves itself into what's natural. But in the meantime,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:12.180
 on the path, we really have to keep testing it, keep trying it, keep looking, keep unpacking,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:21.700
 keep opening, keep engaging it, keep making it a lived experience, this contemplation.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.260
 Because when really big disruptions happen, and this is the age of disruptions, it's the

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:34.340
 degenerate age. That's, I mean, it's just one of those heart, really heartbreaking things,

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:47.560
 it doesn't get better until Buddha Maitreya comes, gets more narrow minded. But we don't

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:54.580
 have to follow that current, more fighting, we don't have to do that, more weapons, we

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.260
 don't have to do that, more competitiveness that just doesn't think twice about someone

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:05.820
 else. We can love, and we have compassion, and we can really free ourselves. We can use

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:12.020
 this, wow, this really strong catch that happens in our mind, and I'm wrapping up now, this

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.980
 strong catch that happens in our mind that Vajrayana is based on, a total disruption

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:24.660
 of our normal habitual mind. And the really good thing about disruption is it allows for

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:32.760
 a gap. Something unknown happens, we didn't expect it, and instead of immediately pushing

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:42.380
 against it, we can be in the gap, mind the gap, and we can use that fresh openness, the

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:48.000
 fresh wakefulness as our practice. And we have this whole system of techniques, including

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.340
 this dujum teresar nundro, including all these lojang mind training slogans that are so easy

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:59.640
 to memorize that we can just have ready to bring out when adversity happens. We can really

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:06.340
 just have them. We don't need 1,000, we need 5, we need 3, we need 1, we need Buddha dharmasanga,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:12.580
 and we really need to keep utilizing them, keep seeing the richness that they offer.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.420
 And then we really get refined, and we start to really blend with Buddha dharmasanga more.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:24.140
 We don't doubt it so much. We see that it works as everything's falling apart, we see this

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.340
 is reliable, Buddha dharmasanga. My mind has a Buddha dharmasanga in it, outside there's

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:37.580
 a Buddha dharmasanga, and we always have both, this always available, reliable refuge for

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.760
 all of us, if we just turn our minds toward it. And we do that with practice, we do that

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.980
 with study, we do that with contemplation. So I say that kind of just as a really basic

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:55.500
 reminder myself, this is all basically me just projecting all my things I need to do

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:03.820
 out into my voice, into saying, "Dracwa, this is really what you need to do." And it is,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.260
 and I know it is. And so there's the rub. I know the steps that need to be taken in

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.420
 Kenshin, Paul, and Shera Rinpoche and Kempo Seo and Don Rinpoche. They really said that

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.940
 clearly years ago. In a Pema Mandala interview, they're going through Longchampa's Five Strengths

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:24.120
 of a Practitioner. They said at that time, we know the problem isn't that we don't have

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:33.000
 enough knowledge. Problem is we're a little weak with practice. We don't apply it so much.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.620
 And so what are the ways that we can actually kind of like apply the teaching, apply the

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.420
 teaching? What are the fundamentals? We have to know it. Then we have to really keep trying

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.740
 to taste them, try them out, apply them, and let it change us. And then we won't see disruptions

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:57.860
 and interruptions and kind of as being such a threat or something we don't like, but more

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.260
 is the opportunity to connect even more with Dharma and become the Dharma more. Thank you.
