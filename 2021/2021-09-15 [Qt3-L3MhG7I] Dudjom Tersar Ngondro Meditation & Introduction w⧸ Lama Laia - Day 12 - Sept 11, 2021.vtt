00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.240
 We're all here to reflect, remember, and practice together. So that's a beautiful, precious

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.860
 opportunity.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:28.440
 And as usual, every time we begin, what makes all the difference in every moment for where

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.900
 we move from here is connecting with our motivation. So again, as usual, before practicing, before

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 studying, reflecting, just really tuning in with our beautiful motivation, our joy, appreciation,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 for this precious, fleeting moment, and that we're aspiring with really vast, beautiful

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:01.060
 Bodhichitta that this time together, and really every moment of our lives now and in the future,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.480
 can truly be of great benefit to all the limitless sentient beings, and that we can all swiftly

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:22.380
 attain the ultimate realization of Bodhichitta, which is the Buddhahood.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 [silence]

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:30.300
 And so as we're practicing, again, within the frame of our Ngondro, we're always connecting

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.560
 with what is the aim of our practice. And really, the aim in this context is to absorb

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 the beautiful teachings of the Buddha into our mind and heart and realize them. And the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.280
 essence of that is really training our minds in the great, beautiful Bodhichitta, the thought

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 of enlightenment, a heart of warmth, openness, tenderness, intelligence, and great confidence

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.040
 in the goodness nature of ourselves and all beings, and openness to understanding all

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.240
 the myriad ways. And so within our Dharma practice of revealing the nature of our mind,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.560
 which is the thing through which we experience everything, we have our formal practice, which

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.160
 gives a nice frame, a nice little vessel that we can always keep a continuum of touching

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.320
 the home base and reflecting upon all the teachings we've heard and the experiences

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:56.600
 we have had to continue and touch home base. And so within the framework of our practice,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.320
 we all know I'm just reviewing what's always essential. And of course, this is all from

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.720
 my own little mind, but we all, each one of you, has your own understanding of the Dharma

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:20.080
 and own way of hearing the teachings. And so just please keep that in mind.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.000
 So always when we're beginning, we have what we're called the three frames, right? Begin

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.560
 good in the beginning, we're really connecting with our motivation of our joy, devotion,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.580
 contentment of the situation, early looking, reflecting on the four thoughts, as we'll

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:48.760
 do on how precious this life is, on impermanence, on the law of cause and effect, and of all

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.040
 samsara and all of its challenges and sufferings. And along with the four basic teachings of

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.560
 the Buddha, the four noble truths, so reflecting on samsara and its causes, and then recognizing

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:13.200
 the deeper teachings of the Buddha, that beyond samsara, pervading samsara is the essential

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.040
 nature beyond suffering. When we don't have a misunderstanding or misapprehension of the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.960
 nature how it is, then we see things more clearly how they are, and that's called the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 truth of cessation, the cessation of suffering, removal of our obscurations and our confused

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.160
 behavior that creates more obscurations and trouble for ourselves and others. And then

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.440
 there's the cause of revealing the causes for removing our obscurations increasing of

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:58.240
 our positive qualities of wisdom and compassion, which is the path of Dharma, and reflecting

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.200
 on the beautiful qualities and abilities of the Dharma, which are known classically as

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.200
 the Three Jewels. And we've been spending the last few sessions a little bit with reflecting

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:23.080
 on the aspect of our nundra practice, of our foundational practices, on the section of refuge

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.880
 within nundra. And I think it's important to remember that just like our nundra practice

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:39.580
 isn't something we run through and then leave behind us either in the day or with the accumulation

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:52.380
 of practices. Similarly, with each section within our nundra, we're adding, we're letting

00:06:52.380 --> 00:07:02.480
 our minds reflect and focus on another aspect of what our practice is. Does that make sense?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.000
 So we're not just doing... Like refuge is not separate from bodhicitta, the five main

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 sections in our... I know there's some people who are just tuning in coming today. So there's

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.800
 these five main sections of these essential practices. First, there's the outer, which

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.080
 we just talked about, the four thoughts that turn the mind. And then we have our refuge

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.560
 practice, which is the essence of refuges, our confidence, our faith, our devotion in

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:40.660
 the three jewels in the Buddha Dharma Sangha. And then generating bodhicitta is the second,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:49.600
 generating a mind of loving kindness and openness to be of true benefit from now for all beings

00:07:49.600 --> 00:08:00.160
 forever. And then generating, accumulating our merit, accumulating positive frame of

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.500
 mind and actions that follow through with that. So with the skillful means of offering

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.680
 the mandala to the three jewels, offering everything within the experience of this life

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:18.080
 and all future lives to the goodness and positive victory of the glory of the three jewels shining

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.920
 in the minds and hearts of all beings. And then removing our obscurations through the

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.960
 very skillful means practice of our Vajrasattva practice, this is the fourth. And then mingling

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:40.720
 our mind with the enlightened mind of the guru, of guru yoga, mingling our mind with

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:48.080
 joy and devotion again and again with the heart of awareness, the mind of enlightenment,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.680
 the fully ripened mind of the Buddha, of our precious teacher, is the fifth. And so what

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:05.040
 I'm getting at is with refuge, we're touching home, but it's not separate from any of the

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:14.200
 others. And likewise, when we move to bodhicitta, we still have our refuge and bodhicitta. So

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.480
 the emphasis of each one might be slightly different. I think we all know this, but I'm

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.880
 just saying, again, remembering that is helpful. That's really the essence of all the Buddha's

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.600
 teachings and practices, looking at what's true, as well as examining what's not true,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:44.240
 finding out for ourselves. So once we get to refuge, we have just the basic chant we

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.960
 have with Guru Padmasambhava before us, and all the objects of refuge in the refuge tree,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:01.360
 with all limitless sentient beings before us, in front of us, all witnessing the glory of

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.880
 Padmasambhava. And then our mother and father of this life, together with all beings before

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:21.120
 them, reflecting on the beautiful qualities and powers of the three jewels. Then we're

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:29.840
 taking refuge with our bodhicitta. So from now until attaining the heart of enlightenment,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:42.080
 we take refuge in the Buddha. Dharma, the Sangha, embodied as Guru Padmasambhava. And like we

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.200
 talked a little bit in the last bit, you know, the essence of refuge is really, as we reflect

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.720
 on the qualities of the Buddha, the qualities of the Dharma, the qualities of the Sangha,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.360
 different levels of meaning of what are the Buddha, what is a Buddha, what is the Dharma,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:10.880
 what is the Sangha. The more we practice, then we explore, we see, you know, our interest is fed,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:19.760
 both through what we hear and being able to apply the practice in our own lives. And our faith,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.960
 our confidence, our devotion only deepens because it's based on our experience and our knowledge

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:43.520
 and our practice increasing. So here with our practice, we have Guru Padmasambhava,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.600
 who is the precious root teacher of all Tibetan Buddhism, who really helped, along with King

00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:00.400
 Trisandetsen, Shantrakshita, and so many other great ones in the eighth century, helped establish

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:11.600
 the Buddha's teachings in Tibet. So this living Buddha is what we're kind of keeping at the

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.800
 forefront of our visualization and feeling in our presence right now with our practice,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.280
 when we're doing refuge. And of course, there's all the other aspects of the visualization,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:32.800
 but the essence is Guru Padmasambhava is here, a Vajra guru. And again, a Vajra, someone Phyllis

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:41.120
 is asking, Vajra, essentially a Sanskrit word, and then Tibet and so Dorje, but the essence of

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:50.880
 the meaning of Vajra is indestructible. So indestructible, unshakeable, you know, why?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:00.400
 Because all ignorance is gone. To be a Buddha means one's innate nature is fully developed,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:09.200
 and all misunderstanding is completely gone. So that means in union with just how things are,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:19.280
 which can never be shaken, and is also shiny, brilliant, with love, with compassion,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.120
 with skillful means to tickle all of our minds and hearts into awakening through all kinds of

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:32.800
 different means. All the Buddhas of the three times, like we've heard, all had teachers.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.960
 And it said too, right, that out of all the Buddhas of the three times,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:48.880
 past, present, future, of this fortunate Aeon, of past ones, of future ones, the most kind

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:57.920
 are the teachers that arrive in our own lives, who of course are carrying the lineage of teachings

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:14.720
 and realization of the Buddha. And so we shouldn't be confused when we have Guru Patmasambhava

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.200
 before

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:22.240
 us, who is the embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times, who helped bring the teachings

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:29.520
 to our life, being inseparable from the living, precious teachers of our lives, who appear in

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:36.560
 many ways. But that's really, there's no contradiction. There's that great unity.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.120
 The teachers of this life, who bring so beautifully, like Kim Pose Wong Rinpoche,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:51.200
 that help us to hear and put the teachings to practice in this very life right now,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.600
 is precious and inseparable. So we're keeping the presence of our beautiful teacher with us

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:09.360
 when we're doing our refuge. And again, we're doing that in our formal session,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:17.360
 but also as much as we can, bringing to our mind and heart, outside of our formal session,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.560
 the presence of our teachers, their blessings, opening our mind and heart to that.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.200
 Because essentially, we're really trying to keep that purity view

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:40.400
 that the teacher is all-pervading, the Buddhas are all-pervading,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:52.320
 their blessings are all-pervading. Everything appearing is the mandala of their enlightened

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.640
 activity, to do what? Reaching out and nurturing us. Like Rinpoche has said,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:07.680
 the conditions for our enlightenment are the three jewels. So remembering, there's no separations

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:15.600
 between our formal practice and our informal practice of going about things we do outside of

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.400
 our getting off of our cushion and working in the world. As much as we can, keeping the atmosphere

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.720
 of our practice and the teachings in our heart, and foremost, what embodies all of the teachings

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.800
 and all the practices. The practices being realized are keeping our teacher in our mind and heart,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.920
 keeping them, you know, like they say, above our head, and the lotus thrown above our head.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:53.600
 Because just like the three jewels, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, are the conditions

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 for bringing the cause of our enlightenment to fruition. What is the cause of our enlightenment?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:15.920
 Is our Buddha nature, which is, you know, our very essence.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:28.320
 So our Buddha nature, we simply haven't discovered fully yet. We're beginning to bring out some of

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:36.000
 the its beautiful qualities and relax and let them flow and beginning to remove our emotional

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.760
 obscurations and our knowledge obscurations. And letting that come and increasing our bodhicitta

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.560
 being able to stabilize our bodhicitta and practice our bodhicitta to just bring that fuller and

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:50.960
 fuller.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:18:03.680
 So we're having confidence and devotion to those who've totally realized the teachings and realized

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:11.520
 the truth that their own Buddha nature, who are in the full flower, the full fruit of complete

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:21.280
 omniscience, of knowing how things are exactly as a Buddha, both on the ultimate level as well as a

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.480
 relative truth. Like it's kind of inconceivable to us, but it's good to begin to imagine what omnis

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:27.840
cience

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:35.600
 is like. And the Buddha's compassion, Guru Padmasambhava's compassion, our teacher's compassion,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:45.040
 is without limit. Completely impartial, equally loving, every single being, knowing each one of

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:53.280
 us exactly as we are and giving us everything we need. All we need to do is open our mind and heart

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:00.880
 to those kind of ceaseless, that ceaseless compassion that's not going to discriminate from

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:10.000
 anyone, anytime, anywhere, given freely, equally, naturally, unimpededly, pervading

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.040
 all of our experience. And that includes us, because when we're doing our practice,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.280
 we are keeping all beings in mind, but what makes we're working with our own mind and our own heart

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.200
 to realize our own mind and heart's beautiful nature and qualities. So that's the other part

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:36.550
 of when we're taking refuge, we're having more and more confidence in our own, you know, the

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:36.880
 thought

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:48.880
 of the fact that we actually could be enlightened. And having the motivation for that being to

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.440
 bring

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:57.200
 peace and happiness for everyone, everywhere, throughout all time, like beyond the limited little,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:06.640
 you know, mite in the fur of the mouse in the grass of maybe at least my current experience,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:15.760
 you know, to like that full, beautiful, pure, huge vista. That is like even when we start to

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:24.240
 move through the boomies, not to mention full Buddhahood. So like there's that confidence in

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:32.800
 the fully awakened ones, and also that confidence in our own possibility and potential, that that

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.000
 can be awakened. And then through our practice, we're awakening to be an object of refuge.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.920
 let's just think about that for a moment.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:22.000
 And another aspect of that, again, I know I'm not saying anything new,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:35.680
 but is again remembering Guru Padmasambhava, Buddha Shakyamuni. They aren't merely stories.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.280
 They aren't. They have deep history and have touched this earth profoundly.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:55.840
 But they are Buddhas. They are not limited by time or space. So that means to say they're

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:05.120
 living Buddhas, living Sangha, whose teachings remain in this world. And the more we open our

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:12.160
 mind and heart to that, the more those teachings can come many ways, and blessings can come many

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:18.960
 ways. And our bodhicitta can catch every drop of every experience we have towards benefiting

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:29.040
 ourselves and others. So just remembering, we have a precious human teacher in this life.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:37.200
 And we have the living presence of Guru Padmasambhava, of Buddha Shakyamuni, of Yashisoja,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.080
 all the great masters. But to kind of give our minds something to focus on, we're always going

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:51.600
 to have that all be embodied as Guru Padmasambhava before us. And just like Guru Padmasambhava said

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:59.440
 so many times, as well as in many sutras of the Buddha, just thinking of the Buddha,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:08.720
 just thinking of Guru Padmasambhava with some degree of devotion and love and closeness feeling,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:16.000
 they're there. Again, the blessings of the Buddhas are limitless.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.800
 We only have to open our hearts.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:32.160
 Devotion is the door to receiving the blessings. The hook to catch the hook of compassion

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:39.760
 is through our own open mind and open heart and open inquiry and trust.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 And then of course, there's many levels of Buddha. If we're just going to look at Buddha

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:59.520
 within the Three Jewels, there's the outer Buddha in a way. We could think of Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:07.600
 who is the historical Buddha of this historical period of time, who brought all the teachings of

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:15.440
 the Buddha, no matter what tradition, into this world. I'll go back to this one great kindness

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:22.720
 teacher and this profoundly courageous loving being who attained enlightenment in this world

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:32.320
 about 2,600 years ago and gave a great message of peace that spread throughout Asia and throughout

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:39.680
 all the world, came to Tibet in the eighth century and was established there by Guru Padmasambhava

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:48.640
 and many other great masters. And through all of those peoples, joy, devotion, courage, commitment,

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.360
 we have those now in this world. So that living lineage goes all the way back. And of course,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.840
 Rinpoche's have some really great book, Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:11.840
 They have a commentary on the Buddha Sadhana. So just looking at the life stories of the Buddha,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.200
 as well as Guru Padmasambhava or any of the great masters, is so good at least that looking at

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:25.600
 that outer level of a Buddha, of a fully awakened one. And again, the Buddha Dharmasanga aren't

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:33.760
 separate. The Buddha is also what is what we're ultimately taking refuges in, is the enlightened

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:50.800
 mind, the realization of Guru Padmasambhava of the Buddha. That enlightened mind is in complete

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.120
 union

00:25:51.120 --> 00:26:01.200
 with what we know as the three kyas, which again aren't three separate things. They're three

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.680
 aspects

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:13.120
 for us to begin to frame the inconceivable reality of things. So the Dharmakaya is being fully

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.760
 stable

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:22.800
 to just end at one with the vastness, unimpeded openness of mind.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:34.560
 So that within every Buddha is completely realized. And also completely in union with

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:45.920
 the clarity, with the arising energy of that openness, vastness is the clarity of the Sambhogakaya,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:56.960
 the body of luxuries of the ceaselessly vivid display of that great open emptiness,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:07.920
 Sambhogakaya. And then nirmanakaya is how that appears for sentient beings who haven't fully

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.560
 recognized, or even not recognized at all their nature, or on the path of recognizing it.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:23.840
 So for most sentient beings we know it's the nirmanakaya Buddhas that we can connect to.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.080
 Again, the nirmanakaya Buddhas aren't different than Sambhogakaya Buddhas or Dharmakaya Buddhas,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:37.840
 they're three aspects of Buddhahood. So nirmanakaya in a way, that's how we sentient

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:44.560
 beings experience. And then as our realization increases, then we begin to witness the outer

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:53.120
 Sambhogakaya Buddhas, Dharmakaya Buddhas. But what are they doing? The nirmanakaya Buddhas

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.800
 are coming different ways too. There's what's called the supreme nirmanakaya Buddhas.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:07.600
 That would be like Guru Padmasambhava, Yeshisoja, Mandarava,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:16.800
 Buddha Shakyamuni, these great, great enlightened beings

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.200
 who have appeared in this world, as an example of a supreme nirmanakaya.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:36.080
 Also, nirmanakaya comes in other aspects too, such as art. So like when we see the statues

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.360
 of representations of the Buddhas, mind, body, speech,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:52.160
 the books of the teachings, statues, the sounds of hearing the teachings,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:29:00.400
 that's another aspect of nirmanakaya Buddha. And then also all kinds of varied ways nirmanakayas

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:10.480
 appear as medicine, as circumstances that bring protection and peace and balance to beings.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.400
 So in a way, we're getting back to how there's no separation. The more we open our minds and

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:26.080
 hearts to the all-pervading enlightened activity of our Guru, then the more

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.160
 we're experiencing and benefiting from the nirmanakaya Buddhas.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.480
 So that's on the level of, and to do what? To recognize our own dharmakaya, our own sambhogakaya,

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.320
 our own nirmanakaya. And the essence of that is just what we can do in every practice.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.720
 Look to our mind.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.320
 Just let our awareness rest.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.720
 Investigate our mind as we do according to the instructions. Where is it? What does it look like?

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:15.600
 How does it sound? Can we find it? What shape is it? All the different methods the Buddha gave

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.680
 us to investigate the nature of our mind. And of course, no one's found their mind, not even the

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:32.560
 Buddha. But the point here is that very aspect of what's in our practice, with every practice,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.800
 whether we're chanting or in a silent meditation, letting our mind rest in that openness,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:51.280
 we're connecting with our own dharmakaya. And then inseparable from that openness,

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.800
 that vastness, that unfindability is just the clarity of our awareness, the arising

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:06.240
 energy of our awareness, which as we settle more and more and more and are able to be less and less

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.640
 distracted, and see more and more that the emptiness of everything that's appearing, then the

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.440
 purity of

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:21.600
 that sambhogakaya clarity of our own mind becomes more apparent. And in the meantime, that all

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:30.320
 pervading compassion of our mind, that's uncompounded, that's uncreated, that's ceaselessly

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:39.360
 arising, is our every part of our experience, no matter how muddled it is, or how pristine and

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.640
 unobscured it is, is one another way of connecting with our trust in our own experience,

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.720
 that's open to the blessings of receiving the blessings from those who've recognized it.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.840
 And so then on the Vajrayana level, there's another aspect we've all heard about

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.360
 of these three jewels, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. You know, there's the what's known,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.800
 we all have heard the three roots, that again, Guru Padmasambhava embodies.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:27.200
 The Guru, the Yidam, or the Deva, the Dakini, or the Khandro. So Guru, Deva, Dakini,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:37.200
 are the three roots. The Guru is the source of all blessings, the fully enlightened mind,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:48.160
 the source of all blessings, full of compassion. That's completely impartial, all-pervading,

00:32:48.800 --> 00:33:00.720
 and very, very skillful in display. So the root, the source of all realization is the Yidam,

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:07.680
 or the deity. The source of all enlightened activity is the Dakini,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:16.160
 and the Dharma Palas. And the way those can correlate with the three jewels are,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:24.960
 you know, the Guru is the Buddha, the Yidams, the Devas, the deities are the Dharma,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:33.600
 and the realization of that is the Dharma. And then all the Dakinis and Dharma Palas,

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.840
 all enlightened activity is the Sangha. And again, there's no separation.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.320
 As much as we can bring that into our form or practice, just recognizing that, connecting,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:34:03.200
 in whatever ways we can with that, is helpful. And there's no separation. As much as we can

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.560
 kind of just remember that, gently, gently, gently, again, come back again, and again,

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.960
 and again, to just touching base with our motivation, and keeping the view that we've

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:23.040
 been introduced in the teachings, and try to remember the instructions that we were taking

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:31.680
 to heart, and have our activities kind of follow in line through the support of our mindfulness,

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:39.200
 to bring that in. So I should probably stop talking, and we continue again, our ongoing

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.920
 conversations and reflections. So we'll just sit for a couple moments, and then we'll begin our

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:54.000
 formal nundra practice, which, of course, you're welcome to join, if you'd like.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.280
 So we'll just relax for a few moments, and then we'll begin. And again, we're going to be using

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:10.720
 this nundra practice. And we'll start with a few, again, lineage prayers,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:21.600
 feeling, keeping, again, Guru Rinpoche, Guru Patma Sambhava, as the main focus for all the

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:37.840
 all-pervading.
