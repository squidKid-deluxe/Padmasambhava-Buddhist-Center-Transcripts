00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Thank you everyone for coming. Thank you. Thank you everyone for being here today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.340
 Again, we commend you to follow the teaching, follow the greatest teachings of our Karyamun and Mur

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.000
ugan Massimo, all lineage masters.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.700
 And that's why daily we are following. Again, for that reason, we should activate it. Again, our

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
 vital motivation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.070
 There are very few centers known as Durgitsim, the peak of the Vedara center. In that teaching, you

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 should concentrate on all your conceptions.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.220
 One point is, listen very beautifully to the teaching and otherwise, if we carry it by the force of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.000
 the ladiness and sloppinessness,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.920
 then the even the Buddha Vedasattva and the Bodhisattva are hard to bless to ask. That's what the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.000
 teaching says.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.700
 So therefore, people, I mean, it's not just that, but really, always the teaching says, concentrate

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.000
, bring all the antique and all the beautiful,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.150
 in one direction, and focus on the teachings. That is not just what I'm doing now, but always in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.000
 the teaching and the practices, the meditating,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 all that what we need to do, to concentrate. And all the conceptions are taught.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Generally, there are so many conceptions. We all know so many numbers. There are even no numbers.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 However, we put that all, particularly as a graduate teacher, the Bodhisattva community, all those

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 conceptions can summarize into three conceptions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Positive conceptions, negative conceptions, neutral conceptions.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 What are negative conceptions? Negative emotions.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 That is negative emotions carried by the force of the sub-important thought, really emotions,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 such as anger, attachment, gallows, heavy thoughts, and arrogance, sceptical, doubt and hesitations

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.000
, those all known as negative emotions.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 There are, why it's called negative emotions? As we all know, you know too, because it is not good

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 for now, it's not good for the future.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 They are the cause of samsara. They are the release samsara, root of samsara.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Samsara is not coming from outside, you know, overloaded to us.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.640
 We created it, we saturated it, we maintained it, we created that. That's why this is negative

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 emotions, negative thoughts.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.520
 Definitely when we practice and meditate, they refer to the teaching or studying, counterproductive

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.000
, politically, no room, trying to scale with it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And that take away, kick out, completely kick out.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 What are even the techniques and the words we use.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And then neutral thought, what is the second?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Neutral thought. Neutral thought is not positive, not negative. It's kind of neutral.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.730
 Just thinking of how beautiful, sunshine, or weather, or the snow, or the kind of, just a regular

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.000
 kind of conceptual thought, nothing but big things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.220
 That negative thought, also in the teaching said, trying to not have that or that sort of not

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 negative.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 That neutral thought should not have also trying to change that to the positive thought.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Why is that neutral thought? It has dullness thought.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 That means it's rooted in ignorance. It's not brightness, it's dull.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Dull and ignorance change that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And now to the positive. Positive thought worries.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Positive thought, dual, in the appreciation, and opposite of all the negative thought is positive.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 So that is positive. And positive thought also can be divided into three groups.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Many of you already know that. Those are known as three intentions of the three individuals.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.070
 Not individual, three types of the beings, or the three types of the human beings who have three

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.000
 different intentions.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.510
 Three different types of the thoughts. Those are in very famous teaching of the great master Adich

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.000
as.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Those are called three practices, three teachings, or three types of them.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Those are known as small types of individuals.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And I'm sure you know more about that, that is very famous.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So the first one is the small types of the individuals.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Second is the mediocre types of the individuals.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And third is the bigger types of the higher types of the individuals or partners.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.600
 Those are, it's not the size of the different individuals out appearing, but have their inner

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.000
 attitude of course.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Mental, all these positives, quite good, but there are three different types of that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.220
 And the fourth one is, the small one, is, even we're interested in the Dharma and the practice of

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.000
 meditation,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 but it's only for the kind of temporary purposes.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 It's for the kind of help and the support, to kind of some really fulfillment in these lives,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 or to some degree of the achievement our kind of need is for the time being,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 because maybe you kind of believe that understood of rapidly Dharma,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 and the practice of what have the strong devotion, that strong devotion,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 and the Buddha, Dharma, Thaga, will help to fulfill those goals.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And so kind of thinking of those thoughts and the practice, and the taking it up,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 whatever it is, those are known as small types of the individuals.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 We don't know what the individuals are, now it's a medium.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And that is, and see that all the samsara situation is not really good.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 There's so many difficulty, troubles, I like to leave this samsara.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Oh, I should say really that small, medium, small individual thought, had attitude,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 and the kind of like, I like to be, I like to be in the human world.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I like to be upper three realms, such as the human realms, asura realms, the god realms also.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 So I just like to do, maybe practice the meditative, do something good kind of,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 that will take the rebirth in the higher realms of the three, such as the human, asura,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 all the gods of heaven, kind of having those thoughts,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 and have believed and have trusted in Dharma and practice.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Those are the small, medium of the thoughts.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And then, small thoughts.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And the medium of the thoughts, individual terms, are known as, then, is,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 they see all the samsara as troubles, difficulties, challenges, no matter wherever you are.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Whether it is upper realm, whether it is lower realm, all is samsara.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 There are so many challenges and difficulties.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 It is situated by all those difficulty troubles, those sufferings, and challenges.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Challenges, I like to live the samsara.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I don't like to be in the samsara.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 I like to get out of the samsara.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And thinking of that, we are doing the practicing, meditating.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Those are the mediocre of the individuals.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Those are, in the teaching of cremation, such as the sharakas.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 And the patekvodahyas.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Those are named as mediocre.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 They are excellent realizations.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 They are realizations with the egolessness status.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And they give up the emotions and all that remove all the negative emotions.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And they got the realization of the emptiness of the egolessness.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And they defeated all the negative emotions.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Therefore, they reached arabahud and those are the mediocre.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Mediocre individuals.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And then high capabilities, mayana practices.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 They are thinking, not just only that I like to live the samsara,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 but I like to stay in the samsara and like to benefit for all the living beings.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 As long as samsara exists today, I like to help.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Through their courage, commitment, and immense profound compassion,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 most of them, they have strong courage and commitment and see that.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And for that reason, I like to also practice and get enlightenment

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 and the benefit for all living beings.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 They have a big, enormous vision and goal, courage and commitment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 That is known as higher individuals.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Those are the mayana practices.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Among the mayana practices, what we practice now is zouqin, when it takes us.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Zouqin practices.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 What is always in the teaching, measurement.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And within the mayana mind, zouqin, or the vedayana pose,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 mayana can be divided, not can be.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It is divided into two groups, such as kozal mayana or kozal yanas, not mayana.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Kozal yanas and result yanas.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Or we can say kozal mayana, result mayana.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Kozal mayana is the suttar mayanas.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Result mayana is vedayana mayanas, mayanas.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Both are mayanas.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 But within that, what is the difference?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 The difference is the techniques and the skills and the methods.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 That is very different.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Vedayana has more skills, more methods to wrap up enlightenment.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 That means to clarify the negative emotions and obscurations faster in the cooking.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Those are therefore called vedayana teachings.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And within this mayana practice, what sometimes those great masters divided,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 all the same goal, goal is the same, to reach enlightenment, to benefit all living beings.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It is the same, there is no difference there.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.850
 But within that, that, suttar mayana is called long-distance, long-distancely achieving

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.000
 enlightenment.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 It is longer, longer, longer.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And then, all the dandaras, and as well as even inner dandaras, that there are,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 until the dukkha is called shortcut, that enlightenment,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 shortcut to get enlightenment, and that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And then, zuki teaching is named nyulam, speedily enlightenment, nyulam.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 So, but in the Tibetan world, rignam, nyalam, and nyulam,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 three-tenths of the enlightenment, three-tenths technique to reach enlightenment,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 even we have same goals, same goals, same thing.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.170
 But this time, we are all practitioners, zuki practitioners, mayana practitioners, zuki

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.000
 practitioners.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 What is need is the immense power of the compassion and bodhita thought in heart and mind.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 That's what always in the teaching said, activating your bodhita.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 First is joy and appreciation.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Second is, then activating bodhita.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Bodhita is named always in the teaching, vastness, motivation of the bodhita, vastness.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Our bodhita has no boundaries to all the beings.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And all living beings have also no boundaries, vastness.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Bodhita matches up with as many as beings exist, that much beings.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Keep the courage and the commitment, confidence to preserve that bodhita.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Bodhita and healthy beings, all beings.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So, this bodhita is, again, its intention is so, so important.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And all our practicing meditation and listening or receiving the teachings

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 and recording the teachings, we are combined with bodhita.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Bodhita all becomes so powerful, really tools, powerful way to get enlightenment.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 When we get enlightenment or when we are progressing the path,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 that means underneath, behind the scenes, we purify obscurations.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 What are obscurations?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Concrete, negative emotions, anger, attachment, jealous, hesitate, resentments.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And all, and ignorance, we couldn't find that is why we increase our realization, understand.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And what is the increase in the realization of joy, appreciation, bodhita, compassion,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 respect and appreciation to each other, or within the families,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 families, within the sangha members, within the groups, all others.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 And more passion, more tolerance.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Those are the signs, nugget signs of the realization and the fulfillment of our practice,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 to compare what we are before, what used to be, and what we are now.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 So we see some difference, some of those joys, appreciation, patience, and compassion.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Really we see that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 That means our practice is going on the right direction.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Really we are performing the goals.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 And somehow even we resist so many teachings, practices, all high teachings,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 but our emotions and all that even look more stronger than before.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 That can continue that way.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 That is our practice is not going on the right direction.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Therefore we have to strengthen our joy, appreciation, bodhita, and devotion.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Reactivate it.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 We can reactivate it.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Repress it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Repress in our practice, our meditation practice, our intention.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 We need it.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 This is what the teaching says.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 It says, so therefore with all those beautiful and intelligent thoughts,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 and then kind of have the beautiful motivations.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Really along with this motivation and then with the idea and the teaching,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 the doctrine says what we hear.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 The doctrine says three kaya states.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Again, this is not just saying that thing.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Reality is a three kaya state.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 The whole universe is already in a three kaya state.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 The object is in a three kaya and the subject is in a three kaya.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Everyone is in a three kaya state.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Three kaya, reactivate that.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Not let carry the force of duality and kind of follow up that.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Activate those things.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 With those thoughts, now we follow again on this teaching.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 This is a lucky ticket. And a lucky ticket.
