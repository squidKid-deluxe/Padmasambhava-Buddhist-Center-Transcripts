00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560
 And so, again, welcome. Thanks for taking the time to be here and practice and reflect a little

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 on the teachings. And as usual, just we'll take a few moments. I'm sure we've already

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.960
 begun this process, but just to say it out loud and put the spotlight on the fundamental

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.760
 reorienting and connecting with our pure, virtuous motivation, our joy, our appreciation

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.180
 of our precious, fleeting situation, and really expand that we can take in this moment and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 truly be of authentic, genuine, ever-present benefit to beings through our study, contemplation,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.720
 meditation, which is to say, expand our bodhicitta, open our mind and heart to every living being,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.840
 and rest in that true nature as best we can in all ways to remove our own obscurations

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.480
 to that shining in order to help mature and bring out that innate beauty and freedom for

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:33.000
 every living being without exception throughout all time and space, and then also the purity

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 view of our pure vision and pure perception of the sacredness of this moment and the perfect

00:01:41.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 nature of right now, and then, of course, as part of our practice in the living practice

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.640
 and lineage, connecting with our joy, our appreciation, our bodhicitta, our pure perception,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.400
 our trust and closeness feeling to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru, Deva, Dakini, all embodied

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:39.200
 as the pure and precious Lama, we train again and again to reflect on these four thoughts

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.580
 that turn our mind and heart towards the Dharma, towards what's reliable, towards what's truly

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:57.080
 a benefit not only in this world, but any world and all worlds, and so the last couple sessions

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:07.720
 we've been, I've been talking about the 12 nidanas as they reflect to Karma, so again

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 these four thoughts that turn the mind towards the Dharma are what is known as the outer

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:24.520
 or the common nundra practices, reflecting on, of course, our precious human birth with

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:37.640
 all its freedoms and endowments, reflecting on impermanence everywhere we look, reflecting

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:50.400
 on the inevitability that all of our actions will have their results, sooner or later,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.480
 and reflecting on, then again, the defects of samsara, how samsara is nothing but challenges,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.280
 samsara is born of ignorance, and therefore, wherever we go, there'll be confusion and

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:15.440
 hope and fear, and so the last couple sessions I was trying to review a little bit these

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.680
 12 links or these 12 nidanas which is specifically looking at this thought of looking at the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.640
 inevitability of Karma and how Karma works, and of course, Karma means action, sometimes

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:41.600
 maybe in our popular culture, the understanding of Karma is only kind of half understood and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.920
 that may be in kind of more pop culture, Karma seen as just results, but as we know in Buddhism

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.760
 Karma is both results and their causes, of course that's the, if the fundamental first

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.920
 teaching the Buddha gave in this world, the four noble truths, the truth of suffering,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.360
 the truth of samsara, and the truth of the cause of suffering, the cause of samsara,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.120
 the truth of the cessation of suffering or nirvana, and the truth of the causes and path

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:31.560
 to attaining the cessation of suffering, and the citadel of nirvana which is to say enlightenment,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.560
 and so again I'm not going to go over it again because I've already done it a couple of times,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.240
 but these 12 links are just very, very helpful from the first turning teachings of the Buddha

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.360
 and really illustrating kind of how Karma works, how every moment unfolds due to our

00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:00.920
 habitual patterns which are again, while we all have everything, samsara nirvana is grounded

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:09.040
 in the true nature of mind and the openness and vastness state of mind, due to ignorance

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.680
 we experience the wheel of samsara, encyclic existence, and if we're going to get anything

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.200
 out of those 12 links, right, it's looking at these two places in which we can work with

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.440
 starting to dismantle samsara and work on reducing our negative habitual patterns and

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.320
 increasing our positive habitual patterns and increasing our familiarity with the openness

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:52.280
 and the true nature of our own mind, and so removing our ignorance and also refraining

00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:01.120
 from harm, refraining and engaging in benefit, these are the two accumulations that we have

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:13.240
 in our practice, right, so the results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions which are

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:22.520
 causes are inevitable, are inexorable is what we chant in our durjum terso nundro in reflecting

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:33.760
 on these four thoughts, so just reflecting on the very fact like all these 12 nadanas

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 is maybe so technical, that's why I just thought to maybe share a little bit, think a little

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:48.100
 bit on kind of what really has heart and meaning and really can connect us with the preciousness

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:56.560
 of being aware of the truth of cause and effect, the truth of the natural law of karma, which

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:21.000
 is essentially that all our actions matter. As long as we have ignorance, our wheel of

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.600
 samsara is going to be turning, but we can little by little, little by little break that

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:37.400
 down, so right all the buddhas from everything that comes from a cause, the Buddha has described

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:50.080
 the cause and also the result, and then also are the whole training refrained from harm,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:09:15.300
 which in benefit tame our own mind. So in the teachings of course, there are actions to

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:25.360
 avoid, actions to engage in as we increase our wisdom. So again, I think there's so many

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.600
 places we've probably gone over in these teachings and from our venerable teachers as well as

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.680
 in so many great books really illustrating, but really again to just remind ourselves

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:48.600
 and maybe we can each look individually the ten non-virtues and the ten virtues. So again

00:09:48.600 --> 00:10:04.520
 right we have three by body, four by speech, three by mind, these three doors. So the ten

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:13.440
 things really everyone, whether you're Buddhist or non-Buddhists probably, can understand

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:22.760
 is what causes disharmony for ourselves and others. In other words, un-virtuous activities

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:37.400
 are the three by body, I think you know, and again we'll reflect taking life, killing,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:53.480
 breaking what's not given, stealing, sexual misconduct, disrespecting others and ourselves,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:05.680
 and then four by speech, lying, deceiving speech, sowing discord and kind of divisive speech,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.760
 speech that separates people, causes more fear, more suspicion, more anger and closed

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:29.000
 up barriers between people, so divisive speech, harsh speech, and then just worthless chatter.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.120
 And then the three by mind, covetousness, always wanting more, needing more, greedy,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:48.000
 harmful, angry thoughts, and then wrong views. And here again it's very specific in the teachings,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.240
 wrong views here, usually the first point that's brought up is the wrong view that none

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:04.200
 of our actions matter. So just by being more aware of the law of karma and reflecting upon

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.720
 it and really seeing for ourselves whatever amount we can that seeing how it's true is

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.560
 definitely correcting the wrong view that our actions don't matter, but also of course

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.320
 is the wrong view of just that I exist, that the world substantially, independently, permanently

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.560
 exists, all those wrong views too. So those are basically things we can avoid and then

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.520
 classically there's also these other aspects of just actions that really cause negative

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:47.040
 effects. And again, negative effects for who? Of course others, but mainly ourselves sooner

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.200
 or later. So again, we don't really have a whole lot of time, but it can be found other

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:01.800
 places like the five crimes that have immediate consequence upon when we die, which are those

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.200
 are really connected again, any actions that we create that cause harm to those who have

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:20.240
 given us protection and knowledge and nurtured us is we're really causing big trouble. And

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.520
 then of course there's many lists of other aspects, but then again, these are things

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:33.600
 to avoid. What do we engage? What is then bringing benefit, more harmony, more strength,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:42.960
 more dynamic and naturalness. So again, refraining from all of these 10 actions and along with

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:50.600
 them, again, looking at these three doors by body, not only refraining from taking life,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:59.840
 but nurturing, protecting life, not only refraining from taking what's not given, but training

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.360
 to give generously whatever we can, without any attachment or expectation of anything

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:17.400
 in return. With our body refraining from sexual misconduct, which is to say, respect ourselves,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.000
 respect our others, physically, psychologically, respect the vows that we ourselves have taken,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.600
 as well as the commitments and vows others have taken. Refraining from deceit, which

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:43.560
 means speaking honestly, truthfully, you know, refraining from divisive speech, and in turn,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:52.600
 speech that helps bring more understanding, more harmony, more dialogue and openness and

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:11.400
 camaraderie between people. Speaking gently, kindly, and then of course speaking meaningfully.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.720
 And then again, turning these three poisons of the mind, the three wrong actions of our

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:26.360
 mind, so whenever being more content, appreciating what we have, who we are, where we are, having

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:38.720
 a more loving, kind heart and mind, and then being mindful of the law of cause and effect.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:50.040
 Being more mindful, training on our meditation, bringing out more wisdom. So again, just going

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:59.200
 over those. Sorry if you've heard it so many times, but again, the point is being mindful,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:09.840
 what makes an action virtuous or non virtuous? It's mind, right? It's really these last three

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:16.280
 activities of mind, and how they reflect not only within our habitual thinking and inner

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.720
 dialogue and inner atmosphere, but how we reflect that out with our speech with our

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:40.280
 body. So what makes something more virtuous or not is the degree of love, wisdom, compassion

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:49.000
 that we sit with and act from. What makes something non virtuous is how much attachment,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:00.380
 anger, ignorance, clinging, you know, our actions spring from. So of course, for most

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:09.720
 of us, it's kind of mixed. But the point is being mindful, connecting with our motivation,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 again and again and again, this mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness. Again, it's been

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.640
 said before, and it's so important to remember, it's what's within the 12 nidanas and repeated

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:35.800
 throughout all the teachings, you know, we can't necessarily change what arises. Everything

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:46.120
 that arises is due to our past actions. And the frame of mind that we were in the views

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:54.640
 we held, you know, correct or incorrect or wherever in the spectrum that goes, everything

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:02.800
 we experience on the inner level, when our perceptions in our circumstances is the result

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.720
 of our past actions, and the motivations and the state of mind in which we did them. But

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:19.080
 of course, we're not slave to our circumstances. We can be. But again, as Dharma practitioners,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.680
 we're working towards our own freedom and the freedom of everyone, which is to recognize

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:33.840
 our innate freedom and the choices we have, and the real being very aware of the strength

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.240
 of our karma, the strength of our habitual patterns. And as samsara beings, the strength

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:47.560
 of our ignorance, the strength of our hopes and fears and how we are kind of propelled

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:56.120
 by habitual patterns. And so by the beauty of the practices, we have these skillful means

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:06.160
 again to release what's negative, engage in the positive, take on the paramitas practices,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:26.960
 in in shamatha, in vipassana. When we catch ourselves in the negative, kind of moving

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.840
 from a negative motive, like being totally honest with ourselves, recognizing that and

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.880
 purifying, recorrecting and reorienting our motivation, connecting again with what we

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:50.720
 truly value, what really sings in our heart, what we value, how it connects with our bodhicitta,

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:59.720
 how it connects with the commitment we've taken in our path and our practice and aligns

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:06.320
 with our bodhicitta motivation, and the view and our practice and the instructions we've

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:18.680
 been given. The results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions, which are causes are inevitable.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:30.400
 And again, being mindful, alert, conscientious, so important for all of us. Again, we're all

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:40.980
 aspiring Dzogchen yogis and yoginis with this big aspiration for not only our own freedom

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:49.760
 and liberation, but the liberation of every single living being in throughout all the

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:58.780
 omniverse, or at least but connecting with our motivation. So even if it's just wishing

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:07.040
 we had more authentic motivation for that, or wishing we wished for that, you know, wherever

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:14.280
 we are in that, it's so beautiful, it's so powerful, so strong. And again, we shouldn't

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:25.360
 mix up our view and the great openness of our situation, of the great perfection with

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:35.480
 the truth of cause and effect. Like Longchenpa has a beautiful quote, "Until grasping ceases

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:44.080
 in stainless space the karma of cause and result manifest compounded by the mind and

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:55.160
 performed by the mind." All these phenomena occur in the mind. The mind names the appearances

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:06.880
 of mind. So therefore, in order to subdue the mind of delusion, be diligent. Or like

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:17.720
 Guru Padmasambhava says, "My view is as vast as the sky. My attention to cause and effect

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:28.600
 is as fine as flower." And like Kenshin Poldan Rinpoche said so beautifully, "If we love

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:38.160
 the result, the idea of the result, the goal of the result, then we need to love and nurture

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:49.860
 the causes even more." And again, how precious that we have this opportunity, just like imperman

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.600
ence

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:58.160
 isn't just a bummer to know about. Impermanence, again, is the gateway to understanding the

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:07.040
 openness of the situation. Without impermanence, nothing could change. Which means also, right,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:16.720
 change for the good, change for more true, free, flowing experience of wisdom, love,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.720
 compassion. The same goes with karma and what might even be appearing as an obstacle. Gives

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:34.340
 us the opportunity again to relax our mind, look to our mind, rest in our rikpa, connect

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:41.600
 with our bodhicitta and our motivation, and also along with those relative level things,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:52.960
 maybe listen a little more closely. So I think I'll stop talking now. But again, just reflecting

00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:10.040
 on these karma, cause, result is inevitable. The fully ripened effects of in samsara, of

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:16.400
 virtuous and non-virtuous actions is said to be, non-virtuous actions is said to be

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:25.080
 born in the lower realms. With again, the most severe, strong karma, negative karma

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:31.960
 being born within the hell realms. And then the lesser degrees, hungry ghosts and lesser

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:40.920
 degrees of negative emotions and activities in the animal realm. And then again, kind

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:50.680
 of more blocky view, the results of, the fully ripened results of our positive actions born

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:57.640
 within samsara, born in the higher realms. The most refined, powerful, maybe born in

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:09.480
 the god realms and the asura realms less. And then again, the human realms. Then there's

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:16.960
 also, like again, just to reflect on these truths of our cause and reflect that the fruit

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:27.480
 or the result is always going to reflect the seed. If we plant a sweet, the seed of a sweet

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:35.940
 fruit and nurture it, it's going to bring sweet fruit. If we plant a seed of a bitter

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.980
 fruit, it's going to bring a bitter fruit. If we plant something mixed, it will bring

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:50.040
 mixed. Likewise, you know, the kind of immediate results of our virtuous and un-virtuous actions,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.640
 we can reflect on the inevitability. Taking life, for example, the Buddha says, results

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:12.120
 in a short, short life. Protecting life, nurturing life, results in long life, healthy life,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:19.640
 wealthy life. The environment that we experience, again, I'm not going to go through all the

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:25.680
 different, these 10 non-virtuous, but can just give a taste of it. The environments

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:33.020
 we live in as well, the results of, you know, kind of negative activities as far as the

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:42.040
 environment we experience is going to be more unhealthy, more barren, more uncomfortable

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:51.320
 and challenging and dangerous as a reflection of our karma as far as the environment. And

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.680
 likewise, the environment that comes as a result of our positive karma is going to be

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:07.120
 more nurturing, bountiful, harmonious, you know, nurturing all these good, positive outer

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:16.200
 environmental qualities. So again, our actions are inevitable, reflecting on that truth,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:23.560
 studying more of the words of our precious teachers and the Buddha, Padmasambhava and

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:30.480
 all these wonderful commentaries from these great masters. Really, I know I need to look

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:39.880
 more and reflect more and even more take to heart, but really all of our actions matter

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:47.920
 and do have their results. I truly believe that with our Dharma practice, in this life

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.760
 we may only see a glimmer of the positive results, but we dedicate the merit for all

00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:01.400
 beings and trust the words of the Buddha, that it would just continue the vastness of

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.160
 what's behind what we might glimmer in this life will show truly show and truly be of

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 benefit. So again, thank you for being with me through my little meandering. And let's

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.240
 actually take these to heart and each one of us as we can bring the meaning of the teachings

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:29.200
 as we know them, each one of us for ourselves into our practice, and we'll go through our

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:37.560
 nundra practice. We'll do a few moments of silent meditation and then maybe seven line

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:44.080
 prayer with that invoking all of the great lineage masters and then we'll continue with

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:53.040
 our nundra practice.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:32.880
 Thank you everyone again. And if I may, I just want to add one little thing from a little

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:43.720
 Dharma talk versus maybe I wasn't explicit enough about the good results of our Dharma

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:50.880
 practice. So it's kind of implicit with everything we're doing. But when I talked about kind

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.360
 of the the positive results of connecting with virtue, it was mostly on a little more

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:06.360
 samsara level of like the positive rebirths within samsara, which is wonderful and good,

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:12.560
 how wonderful for samsara beings ourselves included, but just want to add and say and

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:19.400
 rejoice that of course, like as we hear the teachings, contemplate the teachings, apply

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:27.200
 the teachings and really connect with our pure motivation and have our actions follow

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.600
 and that they're in accordance and we're honest with what our current capacities are, then

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.640
 naturally we're going to just according again to this natural law, move forward, remove

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.720
 our obscurations and bring out our Buddha nature more. So that means results not only

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:54.240
 positive rebirths within samsara, but then moving through the results of moving through

00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.680
 all the path, the five paths and all the realization and results and abilities moving through the

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:10.800
 boomies until of course a final and eternal always enlightenment in Buddhahood. So anyway,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:17.680
 I just wanted to kind of put that out clearly. It's not excluded. Thank you.
