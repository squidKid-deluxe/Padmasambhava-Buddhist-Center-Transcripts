00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.090
 And he said to me, "In this upper valley of this mountain, there is a beautiful holy place of Guru

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.400
 Padmasambha. But if you like to go, I will help you. I will help you."

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.500
 She said that. She said that and she walked. Walked that direction. So I followed up her hair, this

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 bhukkhani or this naan bhukkhani.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.510
 And then so kind of well, I'm following, she turned out and she said, "This is a really special

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.800
 substance that you can walk past."

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.000
 She said that and she put something to his feet, feet like ointments.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Then, the moment he put that on his feet, then I kind of almost flying. I flew.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 I mean, I flew and there's like beautiful area that I arrived, I'm here and here, arrived, arrived.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Beautiful rainbow lights, shimmering rainbow lights. There's so many beautiful flowers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.820
 Their patterns are just glowing but shimmering. All the area is like glowing and also so soft, kind

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.000
 of soft and almost like dancing clothes, dancing for this kind of clothes and that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 And when I look to my body, it looks like mirror images, my body like mirror images.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Then, I went, there is in the middle of this beautiful building like forest, forest.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And this bhukkhani, bhukkhani pointed out to that, that forest or that big mansion, mansion.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And this nail of this building is nakachunzi, nakachunzi. Nakachunzi means the big of the garuda.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.690
 Think of the garuda as nose, nose, nose. Whatever you do, break, inspiration, it will be fulfilled,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.000
 she said that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.320
 At the front of the door, there is so many dancers. Dancers are dancing and so many watchers are

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.000
 flying to you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 When I went inside of the temple, that mansion and all the 35 Buddhas, Buddhas of the compassion,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Buddhas are all there and they are kind of almost everyone is talking.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 In my mind, I thought this cannot be women who are all women, this is something different.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And then, I went 37th floor of that building, that mansion.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.320
 There is then the perfect old adherakas, adherakas, the assembly detail of the adherakas as

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.000
 reflecting sun in the water.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That it just can't even, the glory is so horrible that it's difficult to look careful of that.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 At that time, there is one lady came, came, came and she is holding the scarf up and green ribbon,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 green scarf, not ribbon, scarf, she came.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.510
 And she pulled up from there, she brought also, she brought two box, two box, two box and kind of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.000
 both are stuck on one after another.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And one box is kind of turning on the right side and one box is turning on the left side.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And inside the boat, she brought some red liquid, red liquid and she gave me that red liquid.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And without any hesitation, with devotion, I drank that red liquid.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.910
 And then in my mind, I thought this lady must be Vaidya Varahi, Varahi, Varahi and I thought this

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.000
 is really suspicious.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.170
 And then they said that Bhutani that was accompanying with him, that was, I think, oh, she said, oh

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.000
, you are so fortunate, you are so fortunate, fortunate, you received all these things, she said.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.490
 And then again that, that, that dakini that who hold the scarf up and green scarf, scarf, and she,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:05:02.180
 she, she gave me, she, sorry, she hold five dollars of the, five dollars of the was bumba, V-A-S-E,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.000
 was, and from there she pulled, pulled the water

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 and they said, I'm going to give the empowerment and purify your observations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And so when she did that, I asked that none, the Bhutani.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And, and we, please tell me where, where, which country this is, which country this is.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 When he asked that and Bhutani told me, told me this is the, is the, the Copper Glory Mountain.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.020
 It's lot of real land, and this, you know, this, travel this building, building or the mansion,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.000
 where somebody is leaving, leaving.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.500
 And this is the direction, and so in the north, and west, this all the city of the cannabis, there

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.000
 is so many also emanate from some of us, from some of us, some of us, and so many us.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And we are this very detailed kind of mansion in those that I want to go there.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.480
 But then when she said that I was so excited and happy, I was jumping up and down, down and looking

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.000
 all the directions, I was so happy.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And then what, then I looked all the way there's a place.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 What is that? This area is kind of so dark and very dull looking. What is that?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.730
 And she said, and this, then she said, that is the, the, the Pungo area, where the birthplace of it

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.000
, the Yasunya Bahim Sahar, that area, she said.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 And then, and then I said to this Bhutani, I, now I don't really need to go back to my country.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 My country, I'm glad to stay here. Please help me to stay here. So, so he like to immigrate here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And so, please help me to stay here. And he said, no, this is your vision and your dream.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 This palace, you cannot stay now. Now, she said that, she said, you cannot stay.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And then I looked to the every direction, it is glowing shimmer.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So I went on the top, the top of the palace, top of that mansion, there is Gurbel Masambha.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.540
 So powerful, so majestic, so dignity, as the glowing sunlight that, and yes, it is even hard to

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.000
 look, look to eye as you can look to the clearly to the sun as that.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And Gurbel Masambha is sitting with the economic mother.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 In the, in the, in the economic mother, he is holding long life was, was.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.220
 And in the, in the Gurbel Masambha was surrounded by many, many, many dharas, who was wearing those

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.000
 lama hats.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Many, some I can recognize and some I cannot recognize.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.020
 And whether I recognize, no, and whether I can recognize or not recognize, everyone says very happy

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.000
 to see me.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.710
 They are kind of happy, and they speak, kind of making beautiful eyes, because prayers, and they

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.000
 are playing them, the ritual object.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.350
 And also same time from the sky, so many raisins are coming, raisins, raisins, raisins, raisins

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:47.000
 that you eat, raisins and the dates, dates are really coming as a range.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And everything is falling like in front of whatever you like to step, all is coming, coming.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 And you don't have to make teas, you can have teas, you don't have to make tambas or tambas in it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.390
 I don't know you saw the tambas, how they eat, they make tambas in the bowl and then with the hand

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.000
 they make like dough.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.660
 So here you see, you don't really have to do that effort, it's all coming like this in front of you

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.000
.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 And also it starts losing, it starts playing, it's so beautiful.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 And then my kind of conception of solitude is completely disappeared.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.480
 Is subcontinent as a kind of natural arising, that mindfulness is so common source, clearly,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.000
 clearly believed.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 At that time, Gurbel Masambhava gave me a lot of many blessings.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And then he gave also many teachings.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 And one of the teachings he said, "Omar home."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.810
 And at the end he said, "Om," I just asked him, kind of breathing, "Om," he started with the brave

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.000
 brothers.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:24.240
 It's the relative truth of the, not K-N-O-T, not of the current channel of the relative truth must

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.000
 be released.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And the movement of the emotional wind starts.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.260
 And the essence element of the white and red are beyond of the complex cities or the blue of any

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.000
 aspectus.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 All that is concentrated within the central channel of the central channel with westerns.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 The day and the night are in the great luminous state.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:12.300
 And that is the all accomplished in the college of the Pemambhajar, which is the name of Gurbel Mas

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.000
ambhava.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.490
 So that is absolutely Gurbel Masambhava, which is in several levels within every college of the n

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.000
atures.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And that which is also completely within the great Dzokha-Chingokha, perfect state.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And then in the same, he said, "Pay, pay."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.570
 And that Gurbel Masambhava said, "At that moment, my consumption completely merged in the pure

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.000
 state of the true natures."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And then when that happened, afterward, I looked back to the Gurbel Masambhava again.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And that moment, I see there is no subject and objects are all merged in one status.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And every direction, there is nothing substantial, solid existence, solid existence.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 All is within the one Dharmakaya status.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 So it remained in that locked space for a long time.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 And then I am able to see that so many Vidyadharas, countless Vidyadharas, one after another.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And then I found the second flow of that measure.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 In the way I saw the Buddha Aktrovias and at the seven Vedas and Buddhas, they are all there.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 They are clearly, I saw them.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And then I was scared of the verandas of that mention.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 There is also many levels, the kind of rooms.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But one of those verandas went there and all the Dharmaparas did.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And all the Mahakalas, all the Mahakalas.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And then there is also one area, there is also mentions of the life of the blood.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And as well as all the many kind of weapons, so powerful, so frightful.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 There is the Rahula and the Duryadhava, Duryadhava, Duryadhava.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 They are all there, they are kind of smiling to me.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 And then in every direction I looked, everything is really like shimmering and translucent status.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 There is not all that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Again, I went to the Duryadhava and the Mahasambhava.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 He gave me the instructions of the three Gaiyas and as well as many of the Doki teachings.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 And then I received those teachings in unforgettable memories that I received.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And then I feel so happy, so delighted, delighted and so happy.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And that moment I got to some other places.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 And the place there is just everything is kind of dark, so not dark.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Every that area is yellow and green tokens.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And there are so many beings are making prayers to Guru Mooji's words.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 And in front of each of those beings, there is also the emanation of the Mahasambhava.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Accordingly, there are signs of that.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 And Guru Mooji gave me the teaching. And it made me stronger my devotion to Guru Mooji.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And then I asked again, where is this country, what this country is?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 And she said, this is the outskirts of the kind of countries.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 All the people who are here, they are non-retor status.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 They are not going back to the samsara.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 They are all non-retor status.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And they are the practitioners of the Guru Mooji's teaching.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Middle and mediocre and lower level of the practitioners.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 But however, they never go back to the samsara.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Samsara.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And even though lower levels of the low grade of practitioners,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 to compare with the practitioners in the human world,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 they are the rainbow body. They almost achieve the rainbow body status.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And when I look kind of straight, a short time,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 and look every up in the sky, dawn in the earth,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 everything is radiating, shimmering in the white and red colors.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And all the rivers are singing or making noise,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 sound of the ari in the garlic, such as ari, gakan gagan, all of that.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Then I asked again, what this country is, this country is.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And she said, this country is known as the country that we keep purifying,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 habije pejan, of the suffering, instantly controlled.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And she said, all these people resist the empowerment and teaching of the Guru Mooji.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And she said, there are many different countries.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 There are five different countries.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 And all the people who are born in this country,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 they resist also teaching, and not just that,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 but they resist blessing objects, such as Dharma medicine.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 They all have that.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So now they are very excited and good status.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 They are going to do a soon go higher stage of the realizations.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And then in my mind, I thought, wow, that's really true,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 to compare in the human world, how wonderful, how joyful this place is.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 I said that.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And then immediately, kind of soon after that change,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 I was in again another place.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 There are so many horses, horses of the conch shell,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 horses and birds of the turquoise.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And the yak and the cross of yak and cow is called zu.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 So there are zu and yaks of the gobblers.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And golden fishes.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And turquoise, ebbets.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And mumi, mumi is another semi-precious.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 I don't know anything, but that mumi, barbasa.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 True, true.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 And the procs.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Procs.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 And silver grown hogs.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And the mouse.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Silver grown hogs and the mouse.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And there are so many other animals.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 All are in different jewels.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Matter of the different jewels.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And what they're eating, they're eating their food,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 is delicious green grasses.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 And so many pros.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 So many, the real of the murks.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 And the beautiful, the metal of the many flowers.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And it just continues.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And all of what they're using, there's nothing in the negativity

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 that they have to do.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Negativity.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Everything is supposed to, they're just so beautiful.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 So, so amazing.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 And then I say to you, there's none.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 How, what joyful life they have.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 How this happens to them.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 It happens to them.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 And.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 And this is all those are also animals in the world

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 who are connected to the chasing of a mermaid.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 All that they bone in this, this, the head of.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 That's what she said.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And then.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And then I arrived in some one places.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And all kind of become that vegan.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 What my vegan experience, I changed.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Changed.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Now become that solid.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And all the, all the wings have become cold.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Cold.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And, and also the, the area is similar, almost similar

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 as human world.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And there is a kind of many also, what's called that name?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Just kind of sand in a gray, gray places.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Places, place, almost similar places.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Like as human world.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 And I asked you this.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Where this country is, where is this?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And he said, she said, this is the edge of the kind of a country.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And, and those, these people who are here,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 they are also really connected to the, all the teachings.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 They even smallest way, minimum way, the teaching of the mermaid,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 but gradually they will go to that, to that palace.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Palace to the, what's called the peak of the Garuda's nose

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 and walk that palace.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 They gradually they will go there.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 And from there we walk across the two, two more, two rivers.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 And the two paths, P-A-S-S-E.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And from there, or no, so is your opportunity.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 From there you walk two, two rivers, across the two rivers,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 two paths, then you will, you're going to be arriving to the, to the beach.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 And then, that's what she said.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And then very, that moment soon after we arrived, one area,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 there is so many dogs, dogs.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Those dogs are very pridefuls.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And there is one old mom with white hair, wearing downer dogs,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 but very majestic, majestic.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 And he protected, he prevented dogs, dogs, dogs are attacking to us.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 She prevented.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And then not just that, he called us up.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 P-A-S-E.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And then, and then this old mom says,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 "Oh, now from now on you will be free from the obstacles of the, of the dogs.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 And I am the, one of the great master, Juni Vepa, or Akkara.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Gupta Akkara is one of the Indian great masters.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 He is a disciple known as Kshatahiri, that I am.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 I am that person."

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 So he said that.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And then, you know, I went with this nun.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 We walked toward that way.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And there is so many mappas, so many mappas.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And they're all making kind of like big ceremonies.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 And they made also very kind of happy that you see me.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 They're all happy to see me.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 They give me tea and they offer me also talk offerings and all that.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 I asked again to this nun who they are, who they are.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 She said, "Oh, they are, they are the old great thetums.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Those great thetums, such as Lungpa Goh, five Lungpa's, nine Lungpa's,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 and five Trmamepa, and in Goto Chiwi, Nyara Nima Oza, Renzi Goh,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 all those great thetums.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 These are all those great thetums.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And this everyone, these monks, or these mappas,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 and everyone really, as soon as they saw this nun,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 they all make a poster to this nun.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And so I thought, "This nun, I've been long-time with him.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 He's helping. I can't really ask who she is."

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 So I thought I should ask this one of the mappas, "Who is she?"

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 So I asked this one mappa, "Who is she?"

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 This nun. No.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 He laughed. He laughed, said, "You've been long-time with her.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Still, you don't know."

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 And he said, "He laughed."

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And then he said, "She is the mother of the--

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 mother of the--mothers of the Buddha of three times.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 The way that you're reading."

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 That's what she said. That mappa said.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 I feel so bad.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 I didn't really do any respect to her.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 "Hey, so I've made block stations. I've confessed to her."

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 I said, "I didn't recognize you before, and I'm so sorry for this."

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 And she said, "With good sound.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 There's more melody sound than the trumpet or the flute."

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And that's what she said.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And that is in the words. She said this one.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 And she, in Guru Pima said at home.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 That is the beginning of this.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 She, she says.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Pure land of the Copper Glory Mountains, even you called.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 But that is no other than your own nature of the mind with your physicals.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Guru Pima Sambab, again we say Guru Pima Sambab.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 But absolutely Guru Pima Sambab is no other than your own natural mind.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 This I just roughly addressed.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And all this displays of the variety of the colors in the displays

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 are display of one's own, own wind, wind, wind displays.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And we don't know all that as the source of this.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 When you see so many things, then we hold.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Those are distinctly, all distinctly, are separated.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Discriminately we hold these.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 If you start thinking of everything as individual, all of that,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 then you cannot really defend yourself.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Yourself.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And when you're not thinking, reflect your own nature of the mind.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Even if you have the great courage and commitment, you cannot benefit others.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 We didn't have the realization of the true net.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Gaius and the wisdom is one's own nature of the mind.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Even if you can speak so well, you won't get enlightenment.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Meanwhile enlightenment.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 And up, up these mountains, between these all the trees and forests sitting,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 and lower down all the rivers and the while or the joining of the valleys,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 those all are display of one's own mind.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Mind.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Don't forget, keep that in mind.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And then she says, "Ah, ah, ah, three times."

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And then again I said, I tell rakfuji to you.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 I'm so sorry, I did not recognize to you.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Again, she said, more beautiful voice than the measurements, she said.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 And she said, ri, ri, all is true what you said,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 but it is the conception of ignorance.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 And when the baby looked, or when child looked the mirror

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 and making the commentaries on what you see on the mirrors,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 mirrors, but reality is mirror images.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 When those bigger person, poor people, don't recognize

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 the gold is inside their own houses.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 When you don't recognize your own display,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 people are diluted in a part of cities.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And everyone is caught by one's own creation as like cocoons.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And now it's time, time to release all those thoughts

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 as snake release is all not by itself.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Similarly, this mind and the mind and the appearance

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 are inseparable. It's display of one's own mind.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 All are clear like luminosity and simultaneously

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 the probability of both samsara and nirvana.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And I am the mother of the old true natures,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 or mother of everyone.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Externally, I am Dakini of the Samitunis.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 In worldly, I am the 21 Aras.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And secondly, I am the five Dakinis.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And similarly, I am the great mother of the Dharmakaya.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And externally, I am the 12 Dhammas,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 which is protector of the Tibetan, or protector of the Tibetan,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 or protector of the Dharmam.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And inwardly, I am Vayyavara.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Secret level, I am Ishim Swatyam.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 There is no difference between the Buddha, Sami, the Buddha and me.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Again, moreover, externally, I am the five elements,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 or mother of the five elements.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 In worldly, I am the five offering goddesses.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 In the secret level, I am the Mama Ekachathas.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And again, all that is display of the true nature.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 All pervasive, all real, all performing,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 and all free from the Substantials.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 And channels, the winds and essence elements are within me, or me.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 I am the channel essence and winds.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Don't forget that, and keep that in mind.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 That's what she said.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 She said, at that moment, when she said that, at that end moment,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 then I woke up, gradually in mind.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And when I woke up, I said, mother, mother, mother, mother,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 I wish I didn't wake up.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 I woke up, and I still did that dream,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 how is, how that nice, how this nice.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 But I woke up, and I started writing down this all,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 all in the life of the butter land, writing down this.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And so that's what I wrote.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 But the afterword, generally, out in here, let's quote.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 I went many times to the Cup of Glory morning with my dream yoga practices.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And each time it's not always the same, but it's different.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Different, different, the same.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And also when you're sitting in the garden,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 but here, also a variety in the mud.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 I don't know what the reason, those kind of different displays,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 maybe it's due to my own channel and wind displays.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And then similarly, I went with the dream yoga.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Dream yoga in the east, pure land of the Buddha Veda Sattva,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 pure land of the Rindasambhava, pure land of the Amitabha,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 pure land of the Amoghasiddha, and pure land of the Buddha Veda Jana,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 as well as Bodhala, Jahnogi, and even in the Buddha Gaya.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 So many places, but then those all, it's too much to write it down,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 it's too much difficult, but I went all that, those places.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 That's what the master, what's it called?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 The very master, Yatsun-Yungpo, said, this is his.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 He was, also this is not his regular life story.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 This is like very personal experience, life story.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 That was, he wrote that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 And so now we talk a little bit about, I mean,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 concluded this Yatsun-Yungpo, and then Yatsun-Yungpo.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Yatsun-Yungpo, so he's completely old,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 he's African, completely purple, and he was a part of it, as I said.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Renowned as fully ordered monks, and always so humble, so simple,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 and stayed in hermitage all the time.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 And that's it, it's just a simple monk that will be.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And so, and that through that, he benefited to all beings,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 directly, indirectly, directly.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And he established this monastery called the Pangari Monastery

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 in the Fungo area, which is still existing in here.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 So that time, which is like 1959, before that, I think existing,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 I don't know how it's existing now.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And there's many, also his disciples, from his relatives,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 and as well as his reincarnation.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Particularly, then, his disciples.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 The first one is Gampo-pa Hyabro-nurru-jempa.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 It's one of the very renowned karmakari masters

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 or the reincarnation teacher, and Hyabro-nurru.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And then, later on, when he started teaching,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and both karmapar, the blood had karmapar,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
