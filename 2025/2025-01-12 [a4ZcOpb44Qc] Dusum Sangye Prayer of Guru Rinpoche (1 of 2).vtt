NOTE     "synopsis": "The Six Vajra Lines of Du Sum Sangye Guru Rinpoche, Buddha of the Three Times according to teachings by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche that perfectly align with explanations from the First Great Khyentse\n\nLive webcast from Palm Beach Dharma Center\nDecember 11, 2021\n\n\"The changing of the year 2021 to the year 2022 is approaching. At this time it is crucial and important to invoke the blessings of the buddhas and bodhisattvas in order to balance the elements, dispel all disturbances to the peace and harmony of beings, and fulfill all their highest aspirations.\n\nAmong all great enlightened beings, Guru Padmasamahava and Wisdom Dakini Yeshe Tsogyal are considered to be buddhas and protectors of degeneration times who swiftly purify all obstacles and imbalances while fulfilling all wishes. \n\nDu Sum Sangye (\"Buddha of the Three Times,\" in English) is a very powerful and popular Tibetan Buddhist prayer to Guru Padmasambhava revealed by the Great Terton Chogyur Lingpa and transcribed by the First Great Kongtrul Rinpoche.\n\n\"Clouds of Heaps of Siddhis: A Prayer to the Guru Dakini\" is a prayer to the Wisdom Dakini Yeshe Tsogyal written by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khachab Dewa Dorje.\n\nThe First Great Khyentse, Chogyur Lingpa, the First Great Kongtrul, the Fifteenth Karmapa Khachab Dewa Dorje, and Kyabje Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje were all principal heart masters of the nonsectarian Rime Movement of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. As an accomplished scholar and meditation master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice. A more extensive biography of Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche can be found by clicking here: www.padmasambhava.org/ven-khenpo-tsewang-dongyal-rinpoche\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is encouraging all Sangha participants to please accumulate at least 108 recitations of these precious prayers.\n\nFree download of H.H.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Again, good morning everyone. Good morning everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Thank you, good morning everyone, rakhidellis, everyone for participating.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Again, we are doing today teaching, level practicing too, level teaching and the practices.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 So, it's very wonderful to be again, together on this technology level and connected to us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 In the Buddha teaching always mentions the time and the space is just a mind.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 In the teaching mentioned, when you have higher realization and the space and the times are very,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.000
 very relative.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Truly, these technologies are allowing us some really, some part of that statement.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 So, we all can connect and see each other and then, and also convey our intention and thought to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 each other.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 It's just really wonderful to use these opportunities.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.330
 So, I thank you all of you for organizing, arranging and facilitating and also participating to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.000
 this, our very special practices.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Particularly, this time, this situation and these eras.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 So, again, in order to begin these practices, I think always it's really good to do short

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.000
 meditation.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Relax and calm and just let all thought and conceptions kind of in a way to let it dissolve.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 It is all source. Where it comes from, let that send back and stay as ourself in a fresh, natural,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 calm, peaceful status for few seconds.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.690
 And those are known as chamath meditation, vibhachana meditations, aukki meditation, mahamudra med

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.000
itations, madhima meditations, whatever technique.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 We are using and let relax as those nature said, as we do.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.600
 So, please, just we do for about five minute silence, meditation on those meanings, whatever you do

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.000
.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Thank you again very much, everyone, for participation. Thank you. Saki, deles, aki, beno.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Thank you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Thank you.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Seven-line prayer we do in Tibet and then some other lineage prayer we will do in English.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.090
 And again, with beautiful intention, thought, all the body chata and joy and devotion, we begin our

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.000
 session.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Thank you.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Thank you.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Now we do the lineage prayers.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 We start prayer to the lamas of the lineage.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And I think it depends with page 20 or different book ledges that we have.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And in this one is page 11.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Then there's maybe we don't see other things, other beings, rams, in that what the Buddha told.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 All those six rams, really thinking of everyone,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 may they free from all the suffering, the difficulty, troubles,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 and bring them joy, peace, happiness, reality, and that nature,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 and all that nightmare like karma, whatever they experience immediately pacify it

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 and have them all.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Really, the organ and the natural qualities,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 reveal that, having those thoughts from the heart and the mind,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 and then reflecting, starting the teaching,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 reflecting the teaching of the contemplations, we use intelligence,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 and then practice and meditate, those all known as practice and dharma.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 So today, again, we are doing that, which is wonderful.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That's what I'm saying, really.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 According to Buddhism, in the Buddha teaching,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 there's nothing better and best to reflect the bodhicitta

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 and reflect the dharma in our heart,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 and carry that as much as we can with our activity, benefit to all the beings.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 So that can be those intention and thought.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Now, I will go to the topic, what we discussed.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 What I'm going to discuss is a very famous prayer.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 But I'm sure you do, you have that colophon.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 The prayer says, it was timely, timely thelma teaching,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000

 With the audience, thelma teaching is a reward.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 It's with the audience, with the ordinary audience,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 That's why there's so many great thelms came one after another

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 throughout the generations from around 11th century

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 until now, still continuing that great.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 This great thelm, the one who is a reward, is one of the very famous thelm

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 known as choyur deki nampas, as I said, Ailey.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Ailey, and you all know, I think many of you know, choyur deki nampas.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 He came around 19th century.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 In the 19th century, great thelm.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Generally, in that 19th century, end of the 18th century,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 in the 19th century, and the Tibetan Buddhism becomes once again

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 So many great master came.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Not just not so many great master came.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Those who came, they are so open-minded,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 not restricted by the regulation of all these schools, different doctrines.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 It's open the boundary of those.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 All teachings are blended in perfectly.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 In the very Buddhism, there is the milad, or majority in the Buddhism.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Practicing Buddhism, Buddha dharma.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 But there is also different schools and this and that thing.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 But in the 19th century, these great masters came,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 and they completely, in a way, opened the door

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 of that restriction of the different schools,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 known as the Rimi movement in Tibet,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 and which means without any partialities,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 without any boundaries of the different schools.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Who are those masters?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 The great master, known as the great one of the great ones,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 the great one is possibly chintze,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 the great chintze that many of you know.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And the second is great kung fu.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 Why they named the great great?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Because they are really great in every aspect.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Their knowledge, their realization, their humility, their devotion,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 their respect and appreciation to all the teachings.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Not just their respect and appreciation to all the teachings,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 but they received those teachings from different great masters and practices.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And they told those teachings to the others.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 So this is the one with the really great era of the Rimi movement

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 or non-partial systems and great Buddhism.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 So many great masters came, as I said.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Great chintze, great kung fu.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 And then, this great tertung, choyo deki nungpa.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 And the great master, muhan jangwe, muhan rumujis, and so on.

 All those great masters came.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And among those to each other,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 even though they are so highly enlightened beings

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 and so educated and know all the Buddha teachings and knowledge,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 and all, but yet they are so respectful, so devoted to each other.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 They become the student to each other, and they become the teacher to each other.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 Not just the pertaining teacher and pertaining student.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Genuine, really, with devotion, commitment, and respect.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 That's how these great masters are.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 They really become as like golden light in the great Buddhism.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 So among that, this choyo deki nungpa is one of the famous tertungs.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Famous tertungs.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 He was reincarnation of the second son of the king to some deki,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000

 And he was also very highly educated.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 he was translating books from different other languages into Tibetan,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 known as the name of the translator of the divine son.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Divine is an honorary word for the kings.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 So he was son of the tertung deki was son, and he was translating.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 So divine, translator of divine son, or divine son, S-O, and son translator.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 As he became the great, really practiced and realized being his heart son,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 one of the heart son of the Murat Sembo,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 he emanated so many great thetums, one after another, and great masters.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 So this Churya Deki Nampa is one of the famous tertung,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 and the emanation of the Lhasi Murat Sembo.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 And then what?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 Also, according to the teaching,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 a great chinti was emanation of the conditional depth himself,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and as well as Vamala Mathuram's and Mejushiri's.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And the great kumbravas, emanation of the great oscillator, were chanas.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 So many times in the teaching, you see in the history,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 said that time the golden era of the Tibetan Buddhism

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 come because of all those, like in a way, founder of the Buddhism, reappeared.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Reappeared in the 19th century, to restrain him, to lighten him,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 of the teaching, to secure the teachings of the Buddha and Gurbama Sembo.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Sembo. So this is what really is famous.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And this tertung, I mean, all of those tertung too,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 great chinti is a tertung, great kumbrav is a tertung,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 great of course Churya Deki Nampa is a tertung,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 but their scholarly aspect is just immense.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And their realization, achievement in that one lifetime is immense.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 That light is still shining to all, this really to all the practitioners

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 of Tibetan Buddhism, what they glorified and shine the golden light.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 It really grows, still continues to grow.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 So this is what this teaching.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 And of course, the great chinti was always concerning so much

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 of the beings of these Indonesian times.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 There's so many difficult times are coming,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and they have to protect how to benefit and how to help.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 And it very well have difficult troubles and all that,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 and how to protect the benefit.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 He really, so many times, have you ever had the opportunity to read his books?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 There's so many prayers, specifically related to everything,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 or to change the direction of the degenerations.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 That's those turbulence of the degenerations.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Really making so many times again.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 This is what this great master.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And so, among that, this Churya Deki Nampa, they are my teachings.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And this has become the hard practice and important praise

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 to all those great masters, encouraging to everyone.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Encourage to everyone to practice it because it's so powerful,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 so special in a timely practice of the degeneration time.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 And therefore, I think again, if we do these practices,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 you do this able to practice it every time.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Time is to some sannyas, which is only six lines, not long,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 but with good intention, good thought.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Really pray to some sannyas.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Really it will benefit, it will help.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 To ourselves, it will benefit to others.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 It will help to all these turbulence of the degenerate times

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 kind of happening in these really times.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 There are so many kind of unusual things happening in the world.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 So I think it's really timely practices, and you can practice this.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Therefore, I encourage that everyone who participated to this session,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 so everybody can practice at least one hundredth practice.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 That means one hundredth at-practice is just one mala. It's not that big.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 But if you can do more, many people will do even one mala every day.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Well, how long it takes? It takes maybe twelve minutes if you join.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Or twelve minutes, or fifteen minutes.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 I don't really take longer than that.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 After twenty-four hours, if we spend fifteen minutes to join

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 with both each other, with devotion, I think it really will make some good benefits

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 as explained in the teaching as we go through this.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 So therefore, I'd like to encourage everyone if they can practice

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 with at least one hundredth, or maybe even every day, maybe ten times.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Ten times prayer, thinking about everyone.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 And thinking of what is said in the teaching, prayers.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Really removing all those obstacles and then profiling all the wishes.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Wishes of the body together. Kindness, compassion, joy, peace, happiness.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 Respect the appreciation to each other.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Remove all the suffering, the difficult troubles.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 As in the teaching today, we can do that.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 That will be really so wonderful. I'd like to encourage you all that.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 And then you can dedicate that marriage to you.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 So with this understanding, and now we go to these prayers.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 And this prayer is, I'm going to explain it in two ways.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 The first one is general, how to practice.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Generally, as general practices of the prayers.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Pray. Second, I'm going to explain as His Holiness the New Room will talk.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 All transcribed as it is.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 What is said as this prayer is explained,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 taught by first grade chintze, that teaching which is received to His teacher.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 So that means, teacher of His Holiness the New Room will say,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 the New Room will say, teacher, teacher, taught this teaching to His Holiness the New Room.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 Again, I understand what that means.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 It means that this teaching we're explaining of this,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 the two samsani prayer, is how His New Room will go.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Because His teacher taught them.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 And how He received, how He got this teaching.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Because He received this teaching, that His teacher,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 teacher received this teaching, but the first grade chintze.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 The first grade chintze explaining the meaning of these two samsani prayers

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 to His students and to His students.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 And as that heard from the teaching of His Holiness the New Room will say.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 And then this is the New Room which is written down there.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 So I hope that you understand that.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 I will go over that again more.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 So that means, His New Room will explain a calling instructions of the,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 maybe let's say, a calling instruction of the first grade chintze.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 That's it, first grade chintze.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Just say that, then I go over that.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Before that, I will tell generally how to pray this and go with this meaning,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 this meaning of the word by words.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And now, as every good display, what is it here? Here.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And the page 105, according to this bullet,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 but if you have these electronic copies, which is, then you already have that.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 So you can do it. And the prayer for removing obstacles

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 and the fulfilling the wishes, that is the praise.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 This is the praise.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Praise.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 So now, how we do this praise?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 That is, I'm talking is now a general way.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 The general way of how we do with praise, how we do.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 First, we have the beautiful intention.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 Port, intention, such as loving kindness, compassion,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 joy and appreciation. I already mentioned this.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 And that, again, our whole practice is best upon both each other.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 Love, compassion, and wisdom.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 That is the foundation of our practices.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 With that thought, we are going to do these practices

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 to benefit for all living beings, to everyone.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Really, that intention is strongly.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 And also, same time, feel great joy and appreciation.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful that I have this opportunity

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 to do these practices and cultivate and both each other

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 and bring more joy and peace, peaceful state of mind in my own mind.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 How wonderful, beautiful with that thought.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 And with that thought, and then, do those lineage prayers

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 as we do every year of time.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 And after that, right in front of our spaces,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 we are going to see, visualize, Gaurabhema Samba.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 And many of you already know Gaurabhema Samba.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Gaurabhema Samba is embodiment of all the Buddhas of three times.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 And ten directions also in teaching said. Ten directions.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Buddhas of three times.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 So that means, Gaurabhema Samba is representative of the Buddha of the past.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Gaurabhema Samba is the Buddha of the future.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Gaurabhema Samba is the Buddha of the now, present time.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Not just one Buddha, one Buddha. All the Buddhas.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 All the Buddhas with power, compassion, loving kindness,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 wisdom, activities, all combined in one single state

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 known as Gaurabhema Samba, the Buddha of the Samba.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 That appeared right in front of our spaces.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 As dancing under rainbow bodies, sitting on the laurels,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 the poor bloom lotus of the thorns and petals,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 red and red white here. So being close, very glowing.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 Above that sun and moon dusk, above that Gaurabhema Samba is residing.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Magnificently as like sun.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 One hundred thorns and suns all come together as one sun.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 Like that power, that light, the glory, light in front of you.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 And that sunlight is the light of love, compassion,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 wisdom, and all that light, the beams of light of the loving kindness,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 the compassion coming to us. And it was going to all the beams.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Purifying everyone's obstacles, disease, sicknesses,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 difficulties, troubles, challenges, whatever they're going through.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 And bring them peace, joy, happiness, confidence.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 And just completely clear away all the karma.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 Any entire universe transformed as pure and as a golden light stays.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Really strongly think that, make that connection heartening with confidence.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 And then, I think my praise, may this is my praise,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 completely glorify all the obstacles, disease, sicknesses.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 Really, as in the teaching said, strongly mentioning that.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 Strongly mentioning, as strongly activated that entire thought.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Then what will you say here? What do you say?

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Guru Ramachet, brother of three times, as I have already said.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Guru Ramachet, that means precious teacher.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Why it's called precious teacher? Guru Ramachet is not his story.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 Came one time ago and gone.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 According to the teaching, according to all those great practitioners,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 Guru Ramachet is a living teacher, living master.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 And we practice meditate and pray to Guru Ramachet.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 And the teaching said, really, it is living Buddha.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 Like, come to you, see.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 And those all great master in the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Not just in the new masters or from the new master schools in the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 But all those great big masters, really, they received blessings in the teachings,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 in the dreams, in the visions, or in the direct perceptions.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Guru Ramachet came in the teaching, those are mentioned in their own autobegaraphies.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Autobegaraphies. So he's a living Buddha.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 And Guru Ramachet also said that.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Himself said, that is not something that I came and gone.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 I will be always with you.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Whoever practice meditate and invoke me, I will be with you.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 And I will come to you, as the child is one, the only child when he is crying,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 that as soon as the mother heard, she will go and help to them.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 Same way, I will help and support as to every living being.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Really, whoever called me.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 And this is not just saying that, but it was all those great texts on the master.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Always, only father, only master you.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 So this is what the Guru Ramachet is.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 It's a living Buddha, right now.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 And we have really practiced meditating, living master.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 So precious teacher, one who guides and supports,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 has been asked for all the time, throughout our time.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 Good times, difficult times, and all the time.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 And now, in the future, and in the next lives.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 And so, this is the Guru Ramachet.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 So then, the precious teacher, Guru Ramachet is the Tibetan word.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Guru is what's called the Sanskrit word, which is in Tibetan, essentially.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 And the teacher, and Ramachet is precious.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 It's a precious teacher, brother of the three times.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 And Devachim is also the name of the Guru Ramachet.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 But also, it means the great blessfulness.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Great Phillips, Lord of all accomplishments.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 That means, when you pray to Guru Ramasambhava,

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 it will bring all the accomplishments, all the accomplishments,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 and the blessings of our heart and mind, as well as all the beings.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 And then, also it means here, here, great blessfulness.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 And then, Raka, Raka, wrathful, mighty subdue of all the negatives,

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 negativities, and destroy of all the obstacles.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 So, negativities, external negativities,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 such as all the different time, and elements, and the situations,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 and as well as all those are external-related.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 And in negativities and difficulties, such as our sicknesses,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 and our mental problems, the physical problems,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 all those are really completely horrifying.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 And then obstacles, tragedies, bad circumstances,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 all that is completely, by practices, it will destroy that.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 So, I pray that another trouble will might subdue with all negativities,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 destroy of all the obstacles.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 And then, I pray to you.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 So, I pray from the deep of my heart with full devotion.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Please bless us, as well as all the living beings,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 to remove our old obstacles.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 And again, it says here, pacify out obstacles.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Out obstacles, in one personal level,

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 said out obstacles is physical troubles.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 All the obstacles in the family members, or within the family members,

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 in a larger level to the countries, or whatever they say,

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 or the world, larger level.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 In obstacles, such as obstacles of our health, our bodies, different things.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 When a single obstacle is all, then, known as this mentally related,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 different emotions.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 So, all the obstacles are completely purified.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And then, bless us, that all our aspirations, our intentions, completely fulfilled.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 So, that is like, so as we join this prayer, with these meanings,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 you can join this also in an initiative.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 We join and think that, really, we think of that as profile of all our obstacles,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 and fulfilling all our weight, exactly as it is.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 So, that is a more general way to explain of these prayers.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Prayers, and that is what really I am making them.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 But then, more, the third is explained by His Holiness.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 So, how we go with this, the story of all the obstacles.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 So, that is the prayer.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 And then, join this as I say, you can do seven times, ten times,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 or at least one mala.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Mala, that was wonderful.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 And thinking of everyone, okay?

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 So, that is generally to explain of these practices.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 And now, I go with, specifically, how the great master, His Holiness,

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Dunyurmadi, explains.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Mention this.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Again, he said, this is what, here, in His Holiness, I don't know if you have this copy there,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 but I will try to go over these practices.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 And this title of this teaching, what His Holiness says,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 is that the ornament of the intention of the Lord's bone,

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 and the explanation of the wager word, wager word of the praise.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 Wager is indestructible, word, W-O-R-D, words, wager words.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 So, that means what?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 Every translated word, maybe, lines, L-I-N-E, lines.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 So, six lines.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 It has six line prayers.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 It is wager lines, or wager word.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 Why is it used wager lines?

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 This teaching is, simultaneously arises, teachings, or practices of the Guru Pima Sambaba,

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 not composed by this great people.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.200
 So, that means, as this praise appeared from the heart and the verse in the mind of the Guru Pima

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.000
 Sambaba,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 in the form of the Talmati, that moment reflected, and Choyolungwa, this great ertung, reworked.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 So, therefore, it is wager lines or the wager words.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 And then, so this is what it means.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 And that is, it's timely practices and very special practices of the day generates time

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:29.000
 to purify all the obstacles and, and, profiling all the wishes.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 And the next one is his own, which is making, what's called paying homages.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 Homages.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 And he said, the wager fulfilling jewel means the Guru Pima Sambaba.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.000
 When you, I remember you, it purify and clear away all the obstacles.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 The wish fulfilling jewel, which moment you think it will purify all the, all the difficult

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 troubles.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 To that Guru, to that teacher, I have to pray and respect.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:16.000
 Now, I will explain here, very briefly of this, the meaning of the wager line of the prayers.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 I will explain.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 And that is what the, the praise at the beginning of this.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 Now, in this prayer, what is it? This is a six line praise.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
 To Jamsanji, Guru Rinpoche, as you already have that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 So here, that, this, this six line praise, the first three line, this explaining has,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
 has the outer meaning, inner meaning, and secret meanings in the teaching.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 It has three meanings, each line is explaining that.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
 And how, how his work, Guru Rinpoche, this.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 As I said earlier, he received this teaching, teaching from the teacher of his own Dune of himself.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 His own Dune of Rinpoche has over 27 principal teachers.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 Their home he received all the empowerment, transmissions,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 and the instructions of the entire teaching of the, to be the Buddhism.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 Really he received all those teachings, teachings.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
 So, among that, one of the very important, as like his root teacher,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 one of the very principles, master's, known as, as, as,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.000
 and this is one of the very important master's, known as,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 was in the teaching his own Dune of himself, and said that he was emanation of the, the Vedic Pani.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 And he, this from this, his own, he received so many teachings, so many empowerment,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 so many instructions, and particularly he received entirely, again, once again,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
 entirely teachings of the Rinpoche Tenzu.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 The collective teachings of all the Thelma teachings by great control.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 And many of you know that, I think, Rinpoche Tenzu teachings,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 completely from this Junmi Gidong-wango.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 And Junmi Gidong-wango, during that time,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
 his Holiness received that empowerment of the Rinpoche Tenzu.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 What is this Junmi Gidong-wango told to his Holiness?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 In the group, in the audience, he said, now, at the end, he said,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 I give you all this teaching, particularly pointed to his own Dunyurum, which is,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 you, well, I, among the, all the students of the great two master's,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
 such as referring to the, to the first control and the first change,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 among all the students of the two great master's of the Magishri or the Yangwung,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 the first change in the first control, I'm the only one who gave this Rinpoche Tenzu empowerment

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 five times.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
 I'm there. But now, you will give ten times. You will give this ten times.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000
 And because this Rinpoche Tenzu is a collective teaching,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 so all the Thema teachings that put together by great control,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 by encouragement of the post-Chenze, he put that all together.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 So he said that his teacher, Junmi Gidong-wango, said,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 you will give this ten times because this Tenzu collective works of the old Thema teaching

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
 is symbolized activity of these great two master's.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 And I've been able to do five times of this empowerment teaching,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 but you will do now ten times. And in his own Dunyurum himself, he said,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 I never thought I will do that, that with that many I will do.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
 But his own Dunyurum, he said, is the end. He said that as he said,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 I am able to do ten times. At the end of his tenth empowerment of this big ceremony,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 he said, oh, because as he said that at that time I never thought I will do,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 but now, when I'm looking back in my life, I did ten times.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
 So this is what really this great master's is, I mean, his root teacher.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:27.000
 And his root teacher in his own Dunyurum told me that when he passed with this Junmi Gidong-wango,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
 when he passed, his own Dunyurum went for the cremations or last step today.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
 And they cremated. And then five didn't go immediately.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:45.000
 It took a long time to burn, but the next day, after that, they looked inside the ashes.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 After two days or thirty-third days, they looked in the ashes.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 His ashes become this master, this Junmi Gidong.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 Ashes become in the ashes, I mean, not ashes.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
 In the ashes, you see the stage of Gaurav Emma Samba.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 So his bones, like melted and formed as the stage of Gaurav Emma Samba,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 known as Devachimbom, the blessfulness, great blessfulness.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 Really, he said that. So this is what this Junmi Gidong-wango.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
 So Junmi Gidong-wango told to his own Dunyurum-mochi,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
 that's why, firstly, Chinti explained the name of these prayers,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 this meaning of these prayers.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 So that is what his own Dunyurum-mochi transcribed him or wrote down.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
 As he remembers that.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 So now, in that way, firstly, this line is what, again, as we read.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
 Firstly, Gaurav-mochi, Buddha of the Three Times.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 This, according, I mean, in here, this explaining,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 externally explaining is Amodha Buddha Three Jewels,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 Buddha, Dhamma Sangha, Amodha Three Jewels,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 externally explaining of the Buddha, explaining of the Buddha.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 And so, and that means, again,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 internally explaining of the,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 inwardly explaining of the Amodha Three Roots, so what?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
 Three Jewels, Three Roots.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 So externally is explaining, meaning of the Amodha Three Jewels is Buddha.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:03.000
 And inally is explaining of the, among the inner level, the Three Roots.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
 Well, again, I'm not doing this well.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
 So in the Buddha teaching, when we called, we need to take rafudges.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
 There's an object of three rafudges.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that's the general.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 In inner level, it is representing three, that three jewels are three roots.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 Guru, Deva, Dakinis, Dakinis, that.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:47.160
 And then, in the cigarette level, in the cigarette level, and it's, cigarette level is representing

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.000
 the Dharmakayas.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 Amodha Three Caias, Dharmakaya, Sambukaya, and Narmakayas.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 Amodha Three Caias is representing of that three Caias.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.090
 So now that means what? This fourth line of this prayer is really the essence of the Buddha,

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:15.000
 essence of the Lama, essence of the Dharmakaya.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 Or meaning of the Dharmakaya, or Three Caias, Amodha Three Caias.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 Now, how that explaining? In the teaching said, when he said here, Guru Mooji, Buddha of the Three

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 Times.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
 Buddha of the Three Times, as he said already here, praise.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 That means, among the three jewels is the Buddha.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 So Buddha is what? The Buddha is total enlightenment.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 And this time, as in the prayer mentioned, Guru Mooji, this Buddha is not just one Buddha.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.220
 Buddha of the All Three Times, past Buddha, present Buddha, and future Buddha, all come together in

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.000
 one central status, as Garpa Masambhala.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
 So Buddha, that.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 And then inwardly this meaning, explaining of the Amodha Three Roots, is explaining of the Guru.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
 And that is also explaining here, here.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 Guru Mooji, precious teacher, already explained, as explained.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 It is, or as he said, it is the essence of the Guru.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 And Guru is, of course, you know, that is what means Guru in Sanskrit.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:54.250
 Sanskrit, or the Tibet, the one is above, or above ones, or not underneath, is above, is higher

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.000
 elevated.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 Why? It's what is elevated. The realization levels.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 Realization levels is elevated, not normal. They're not just regal of that.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
 Because realization is a very highly realized being, so all are highly.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:23.120
 And the realization of the scripture, realization of the true nature, therefore, it is very highly

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.000
 elevated.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 Highly, or it is above that. For that reason, and the Garpa Masambhala is,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:40.000
 that innerly represented all the embodiment of the Three Roots.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
 And then, the absolute level is representing of the Dharmakayas.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
 Dharmakaya Guru Mooji.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:58.000
 That absolute level, again, is representing the way is that Guru, where is that Buddha.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
 It's no other than our own, really, the mind, nature of the mind.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.000
 And our nature of the mind is, nature of the mind is Dharmakari, nature of the Three Caias.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:19.000
 So, among the Three Caias, this is, then, known as the, what's it called?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 Known as, then, Dharmakaya status.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 Dharmakaya state of the nature is then, of course, externally, in the Buddha teaching,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 is mentioned, always, in the general Buddha teaching, in the Theravada teachings,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 and as well as in the Mahayana teachings and the Vedayana teachings,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
 particularly in the Vedayana teachings, and what is known as the embodiment

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 of the great blissfulness, the blissfulness of the indestructible, great,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000
 blissfulness, nature. That is really the Dharmakaya nature of our own mind,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
 which is residing right in our heart and mind.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 So, therefore, this inwardly, what's it called?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
 Inwardly is representative of the absolute natures.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 And now, again, I will go over this.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:32.000
 This fourth line is externally explaining of the meaning of the, among the three jewels, Buddha,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 and then, also, in the inner level, this fourth line is explaining the meaning of the,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
 of the three, among the three roots, and the Guru.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 And the secret level, it is explaining of the nature of our own mind

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 and our own nature of the mind has three different qualities.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 Among that is explaining of the Dharmakaya.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
 What are those three different qualities?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, and then the Makaya.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000
 So, among that three, this is, the first one is explaining of the Dharmakaya, natures, that.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 And so, for that reason, and now, again, we do this, what's called,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 as it was already.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 And that fourth one, among the three jewels, is Buddha.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
 Among the three jewels is the first line explaining of the Buddha,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 and the Buddha is Buddha of the three times.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 So, that's already kind of mentioned here.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
 And the second one is representing, or the explaining of the, the lamas,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 among the three roots.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
 And what are lamas, actually, in the teaching field,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
 in the, particularly in the Nyingma schools of the very Buddhism,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 there's lamas of the three lineages.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 And mind, mind, to mind transmission lineages,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000
 Sambalic transmission lineages, and aurora transmission lineages.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 Those are the lineage master of the three.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:26.000
 So, this Gaurabhama sambhava is representing all the lamas of the three lineages.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000
 Gaurabhama sambhava is the embodiment of the mind transmission lineage lamas.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 Gaurabhama sambhava is embodiment of the

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
 Sambalic transmission lineages.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 And Gaurabhama sambhava is representing all the lamas

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
 of the aurora transmission lineages.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
 And this, again, mind to mind transmission lineages,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
 in the teaching field, said, "What are those?"

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
 And so, that means, it's made from the Buddha, Sammada Buddha,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
 to all the Sambokaya Buddhas in light beings.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 All the retinas of the Buddha, Sammada Buddha,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
 and where they transmitted, there is no transmitting the word

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 by the word, symbols, but mind to mind transmitting,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 from the pervasive nature of the wisdom qualities.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 Ah, through that transmitted all the teachings there.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
 Those are known as mind to mind transmission lineages.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 And Gaurabhama sambhava is representing all those lamas

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 that want to send up the state.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 And then, the Sambalic transmission lineage,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 lamas of the Sambalic transmission lineage,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
 all those Sambokaya teachings.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 Sambokaya, five Sathya, five Dayana Buddhas.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 And with their retinas, how did they transmit the teachings?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 They transmitted the teachings really, again, not by the words,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.000
 not spoken, but through the sign and the symbols.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
 Symbols, they transmitted.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 So, that's the way.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 But all that Sambokaya lamas, lineage masters,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
 are embodied by the Gaurabhama sambhava.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
 All that comes in one single state as Gaurabhama sambhava.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 Then, from the Gaurabhama sambhava lineage,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
 lamas, from where it started.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 According to teaching, it started from,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 from Sathya Sambhava, sorry, Gaurabh Durgis.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 From Gaurabh Durgis, all the way until now,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 those great lineage masters are transmitting lineage teaching

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
 through the language of the words.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 But however, again, even though they transmit the lineage teaching like words,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 through the word, already transmitting,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
 but it contains the mind transmission lineage teaching

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 and sambole transmission lineage.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
 So, other transmission lineage is, in a way,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 conversant teaching of the old lineage,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
 with it, atasped. And Gaurabhama sambhava represents all that teaches.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:33.000
 That is what Gaurabhama sambhava is, in Bodhima to all lamas,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000
 lamas of the mind to mind, and sambole and orals.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 And then Gaurabhama sambhava represents of this dharmakaya nature.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
 Our dharmakaya nature of the mind

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 is the absolute Gaurabhama sambhava.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 So, Gaurabhama sambhava is indestructible nature within our heart and mind.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 So, therefore, again, in a secret level,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 it represents our own nature of the mind,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
 and which is dharmakaya nature, dharmakaya nature.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 So, that is the really first line of these practices.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
 And the second one is, and so now, so with that.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
 So, when we visualize Gaurabhama sambhava right in front of our skies,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
 as in Bodhima to all Buddhas, and all the Gurus,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
 and as well as also dharmakaya level,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 and our nature of the mind and nature of the Gaurabhama sambhava

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 is the same state as there is no divisions.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 With that thought, really strongly kind of think of this,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
 this, with that realization, every phrase.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 The next one is the second line.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
 The second line is what?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
 In the teaching said here,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
 give a cimbal, lord with all accomplishment and great blissfulness.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 This has, again, three different levels, three meanings.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 Externally, this means among the three jewels, the dharma.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 This second line is representing dharma.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 At any level, this second line is representing of the yedams, or the deities.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 And the third level, it is representing among the three kyas, sambhokaya.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
 So now, this is, again, what is this line?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 Firstly is dharma, or externally it is dharma.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 It is representing dharma among the three jewels.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 Second line is representing,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 or second meaning is represented as among the three roots, yedams.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 And the second level, this third line, explaining of the sambhokaya,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 nature, among the three kyas.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 That is what we see this.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
 And again, how that represent?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 And here, his own union said,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
 how that first way is represented of the dharma.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:50.000
 We have said, because we follow the teaching of what means dharma, actually.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000
 Dharma means one who helps, or dharma will assure us to achieve

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 the good qualities or goodness of this worldly level and the ultimate levels.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 That is really dharma.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 And what is worldly level goodness?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:19.000
 Joy, peace, happiness, openness, good communication, good relationships.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
 Good relationships.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 And because of that, there is also less disease and longevity,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
 and all those, and the performance of the good things.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 When our heart and mind are in quite good state,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
 we also follow the good things, what we want to do.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 How do we do too many struggling things?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 And then, those are really about the good qualities of the world

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
 and happy lives.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 And what is the ultimate benefit of the by the dharma?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000
 We find our very fundamental cause of the difficulty troubles,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000
 which is the negative emotions, and those are known as ignorance,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000
 or attachments, anger, jealous, head and toes.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
 Those are all purified.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
 And those are also known as in the Buddha teaching,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
 removing the obscurations, purified.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
 How we can purify or remove the obscurations?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
 By the dharma, power of dharma, practice dharma,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
 not any other means we can do.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 So therefore, we follow the instructions of the teaching

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
 as Gaurab and Masambha taught,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
 and with the presence of Gaurab and Masambha right in front of our skies,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
 and we do that, really, it will perform good things in this life,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 and as well as the ultimate benefits,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
 realizations in moving to the path.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 But for that reason, Gaurab and Masambha is embodiment of the dharma.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 So this second line is explaining of the meaning of the dharma.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
 And then, second level, second meaning of this,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 this word is explaining of the, among the three roots.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 Among the three roots is explaining of the jedams.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
 What is the jedams?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 In the teaching, Aupren said that you heard,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 said jedam is the root of accomplishment,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 all the fulfillments, all the fulfillments.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 Fulfillments of the ultimate fulfillment is enlightenment.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 Ultimate fulfillment is transforming this phenomena,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
 conception level into the pure land.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 Ultimate fulfillment of the accomplishment of following our physical,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000
 our own physical, transforming as divine body or the Buddha body,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 or the entire universe transforming to the mandala of the Buddhas.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 That is ultimate accomplishment.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
 And then temporary accomplishment is what in the teachings,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 in the teachings said that if you really meditate, the practice is good.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000
 And then also your mind become more clear and calm, calm, peaceful.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 Because of that, we can get also more knowledge, more wisdom.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
 We can see things that we didn't see before.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
 And through the power of meditation, and those who are,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
 people can walk on the sky or go through the wind,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
 or through the different meditation practices,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
 you can discover in different kind of like, trails.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
 Those are in the teaching making temporary benefits, temporary benefits.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 And then also you become more youthful, youthful.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
 And vitality grows.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 And mind, those are temporary benefits.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
 So all those are accomplished by the practice of them.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 Therefore, representing of the Yadam deities,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
 in the body of all the Yadam deities or representing them.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
 And the next one is the ultimate level of this what the Yadama sambha is.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
 Then the sambhokai.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
 Again, what is sambhokai?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 It is our inner nature of the mind.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
 What is in the teaching said?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
 In the zokti teaching, for example,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000
 the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is dharmakaya.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 Clarity, the vitality aspect of the mind is sambhokaya.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 So this is the, again, to disconnect with the Gaurabhema sambhava,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
 we are connecting to the thirikaya immediately.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
 Thirikaya in that way.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 We connected to the dharmakaya, already mentioned earlier, first line.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
 And now we are connecting to the sambhokaya.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
 And the sambhokaya is what?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:34.000
 In Sanskrit word sambhokaya, in English it is translated as enjoyment body.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
 The body of enjoyment, or sometimes it is translated as the body of luxuries.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
 Luxuries.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
 What that means?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
 Because this mind actually is the most richest.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
 We discover the mind.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 The nature of the mind, it brings all the abundance, the good things,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
 that what really we imagine.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 There's nothing more rich than our own nature of the mind.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:18.000
 Our intelligence, our wisdom, our loving kindness, our compassion.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000
 All that is arising from our mind, or if I use the word,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 from the emptiness of dharmakaya mind.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000
 So it is the sambhokaya is the richness of the dharmakaya.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 The dharmakaya mind, everything is arising from this.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
 In Buddhism, and particularly, yeah in Buddhism,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 and particularly in Mahayana, in Vaidya, in Ati, all is a mind.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 Everything is displayed mind.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 The power of the mind has no limitations.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
 Every richness is arising from the mind.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000
 That is what's called open the treasure of the sky of the mind.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
 It's all.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000
 And that, for example, when we go to the dream, when we go to sleep,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:27.000
 when we're sleeping, where are all our dreams coming? All dreams.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
 And of course we don't want bad dreams, but good dreams if we happen.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 Where are that good dreams coming?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
 It's coming from our mind.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
 But when we change our mind in more refined, purified,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
 all the obscurations of those negative or dualities,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000
 our mind becomes more clear, brilliant, natural, normal, regular ways.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:02.000
 Really then, reflection of the mind will be totally different.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:11.000
 For example, many great masters often say that they see this universe as pure land.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
 Where that pure land came from?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
 It came because they purified it.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
 The duality of the conceptions.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
 When the duality of the conceptions, these ways of the duality of the conceptions,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000
 when purified, then we can reveal the richness of the mind,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
 the nature of the mind, and that reflectings.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
 It's all like a similar image.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 So this sampagaya, that is known as luxurious poems.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 And the sampagaya is always how that is, always in the blessings.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
 There is no suffering or difficulties.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:06.000
 The luxurious, the luxurious of the blessings, the luxurious of all the environments,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.000
 the luxurious of the necessities, everything is in luxurious status.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 And the luxurious of the poems, for those reasons, what in the teachings said.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:32.000
 Sampagaya had 32 major marks and 80 minor marks. All that is, is in that luxurious status.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:40.000
 Poems, usages, place to stay, environment, everything is in enlightened status.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
 That is called sampagaya, in great blissfulness status.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.000
 So that is, is that, at that time, and in his honor you said here,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 without from the moving, without changing the situation of the, from the dharmakaya,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.400
 that every environment of the samsara, nirvana, are become the great medal of the great bliss

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.000
fulness

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
 and the luxurious status. For that is what is known as great blissfulness,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
 the great blissfulness, master of great blissfulness.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.000
 So that is the second, second, second meaning.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 And now we go to the third meaning.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:59.000
 Third meaning is, third meaning is, third, I mean third line.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:08.000
 Third major line explain is, and but he is explaining in here,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 pray the wrathful mighty subdual of all the negativities,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
 destroy of all the obstacles. That is third, third major lines.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 That is third major lines. So now what this third line explaining,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:36.000
 again same systems. First of the outer inner and sacred meanings.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 The first outer meaning of this explaining of the, among the three jewels,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000
 among the three jewels, Buddha Dharma Sangha is explaining of the Sanghas.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 And then second meaning or the sacred meaning of this among the three root,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 it is explaining of the among three root what?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 Guru, Deva and Dakini. And of course many of you know that.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
 What that means three root in the teachings is root.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
 Root of all the blessings is guru.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 Root of all accomplishment is yadams.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 Root of all the fulfillment activities are Dakini and Dharmakayas.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
 So root, root is again R-O-O-C.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
 Root of that is root of the all the blessings is guru.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 Root of all accomplishment is yadams.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.000
 Root of all fulfillment or activity is a Dakini and Dharmapalas.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 So those are the three roots.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
 And then the secret level among the three Gayas.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
 And the first is Dharmakaya.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 Second is Sambokaya.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
 And third is Namakayas. Namakayas.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000
 So among that. So this third line explaining all that third one.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 And Sangha, Dharmapala, Dakini and Dharmapala and Namakayas also explaining.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
 Again we go as we went.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:36:01.000
 And again Sangha.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 Sangha is of course three jewels.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 Among the three jewels is the third one.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:15.000
 Sangha is a Sanskrit word. And the third one is translated by the most great masters.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 Sangha is Gendun. G-S-L-A-S-G, J-O-D-E-D-U-N, Gendun.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
 So what that means the Gendun?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:39.000
 G-S-L-A-S-G is a virtues. And then Dhendun is devoted.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
 Devoted to the virtues.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
 That is Sanghas.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
 Sanghas.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 So now this…

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
 So how we can put it?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 How this third line representing of the Sanghas?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 Again by practicing of the Gurba and Masambhava,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 it will directing our mind to the virtues.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
 It will connect our mind to the virtues.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
 What is virtues actually?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
 What is negative and what is virtues?

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:30.000
 Virtues is mind, negative and virtues is mind, reality.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:42.000
 And what is virtues is love and kindness, compassion, bodhicata.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
 And that is really virtues.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 Where they come from? Prominent.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 What is unvirtues?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.000
 Anger, attachment, ignorance.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 Where they come from? From the mind. Again.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
 So by practice of the Gurba and Masambhava,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.000
 it will help us to turn our mind to the virtues

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 and purify negativities.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 And what that means is clean way,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
 ignorance, anger, attachment.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
 Together with this, such as jealous, heady thoughts.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
 At the same time, it is increasing our wisdom,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
 knowledge, understanding.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
 So this is therefore, Gurba and Masambhava,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
 embodiment of all the Sangha members.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 It will bring the authentic quality of the true Sanghas,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
 respect and appreciation.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 When we have the love, compassion and wisdom,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
 respect and appreciation all comes, very beautiful.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000
 At the same time, it will also bring courage, commitment, patience.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
 Those all good things really come, abundance.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
 And that will assure, help us to remain ourselves in the path

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
 to get enlightened.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:35.000
 So therefore, Gurba and Masambhava is embodiment of all the Sangha members.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
 And here, he is on the new music.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 Gurba and Masambhava is the source of all the dharmas.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
 Gurba and Masambhava is on the crown jewel of the Sangha members.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.000
 Gurba and Masambhava is lord of all the great goodness.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
 That is how it is.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000
 Then, this representation of the second one,

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:11.000
 it is the representation of all the accomplishments, among the three roots.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.000
 Second meaning is the representation of the Dakini's and the dharmapalas.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
 What is really the activity of the Dakini's?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000
 Generally, the root of the actions in the teaching said.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
 What are the actions? Generally.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000
 The action is to benefit into the other beings, to benefit one's own self

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
 and benefit into others.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
 That is the actions of the Dakini's and as well as the dharmapalas.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.000
 Here, he is on the dharmapalas, and among all those actions,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:01.000
 to purify the obstacles, negative forces, or destroy the negative, which is the best activity.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
 And here, what is the teaching said?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.000
 Destroy all the obstacles.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 So, destroying the obstacles is the best activity.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
 What are the obstacles?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000
 Also, these obstacles can be translated as demons.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
 So, what are the obstacles or the demons?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:38.000
 In the Buddha teaching, there are four major demons.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
 What are those four demons?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:49.000
 Demons of the emotions, demons of the aggregates,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000
 demons of the distractions, and demons of the death.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
 So, those are the four major demons.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
 And demons of the emotions.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
 What are those demons?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:18.000
 Demons, emotions are, such as again, same thing in another gracious teacher, Buddha, explaining.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
 Five poisons.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
 Five poisons are the demons.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
 What are those five poisons?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
 Of course, many of you know already, but few of you, but you don't.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
 Five poisons is metaphor.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000
 Ignorance, attachment, anger, arrogance, and jealous.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
 Those are five poisons.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.000
 Among that, five poisons which are on the front.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 People who take the front row, attachment, anger, jealous, and arrogance.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
 Those are playing on the front row.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
 What does that mean?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
 Because ignorance is hiding.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:26.000
 Ignorance, we don't really see. We can't see it in a way invisible.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:33.000
 But ignorance is the root of all the four poisons.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000
 Attachment is best on the ignorance.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
 Anger is best upon the ignorance.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000
 Arrogance is best upon the ignorance.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
 Jealous is best upon the ignorance.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
 But we don't notice.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
 It is on the front, the floor.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
 So therefore, invisible.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
 The behind, what sometimes they say.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
 Silence, real, runs deeper.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
 It's kind of silence.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
 But it is fundamental.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
 Those are the demons, emotions.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
 And then grasping, clinging.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
 Clinging.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.000
 There is good grasping, and good cling is in a way.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.000
 The ultimate level, that is for temporary, there is good grasping and good clingings.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.000
 The ultimate level in the Buddha teaching is that any grasping is negative or emotional.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
 But for time being, good grasping is good.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.000
 What are those? Such as loving kindness, compassion, bodhicitta,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
 walking for growing, developing bodhicitta.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
 Take the examples of the Buddha and bodhisattvas.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
 Take the examples and follow their footsteps with the determination,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
 courage and commitment.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
 That will help us to make strong so that we can eliminate it,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:24.000
 even the good graspings or good clingings.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:32.000
 But for time being, this demon, the gross demon, is all this emotional demons.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
 This is called emotions, bad emotions.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
 Demon of the bad emotions.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
 So that we can eliminate that.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
 That is the best activities of the Dakinis and the Dharmapalas.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
 The second one is, when you have that demon of the emotions,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000
 then we grasp to our aggregates, our physical forms.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
 What is such a word? Ego-clinging. All those are then become demons.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
 So destroying that, eliminating that, walking for that.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:20.000
 And then, next one is, when you got again something a little bit good things.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
 When we have this negative emotion of the demons,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
 then the third one is demon of the destructions.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
 That is something that may be appealing to us,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
 but yet is disturbing and is obstacles.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
 So those are called demon of the destructions.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
 Demon of the destructions is more disturbance,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
 particularly for those even good practitioners in the teaching field.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
 These were big obstacles.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
 So just eliminated that.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
 And then the fourth one, demon of the death.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
 Demon of death is again, when we have the grasping and clinging

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
 with this physical, with demon of emotions,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
 then the body will attach it to this.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
 So that means the demon of the death is interrupting

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
 our continuing journey to the practice of meditation.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
 Continuation.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
 So, kind of removing all those obstacles is known as

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
 the performance of the activities.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
 And then activity, what are the other activities in the teaching field?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
 Those are the four different activities.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
 Passifying activities.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
 And the increase activities.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
 Subjugating activities.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:47.000
 As well as magnetizing activities.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
 All those are known as the obstacles.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000
 And the next one is, and then when you have that,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
 what is said, when you destroy it,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
 when you destroy or eliminate the four demons in his or her,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
 then you will emanate three enemies.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
 Three enemies.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
 And those three enemies, externally,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000
 it is all the obstacles of the duality conceptions,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
 externally, or the external duality conceptions.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
 And then, innerly, all the grasping, clingy particles of that.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
 And then, in the cigarette level,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
 the enemy of the neurotic, or clingy that,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
 is all eliminated by the realizations.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
 And then you are completely actualizing of the great activities,

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
 of those four activities.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000
 And so that is about the inner meaning of this,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.000
 the three root is represented by the dakini and the dharmapalas.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.000
 So the dharmapalas is the embodiment of the dharmapala and the dakinis.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
 And then in cigarette level,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
 then the dharmapalas represented by the three kayas of the narmakayas.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:21.000
 And again, the narmakaya is the display of the dharmakaya or the sambokaya.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
 And that is known as narmakaya.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
 What is narmakaya?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
 And this is the Sanskrit word,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
 again, if we translate it into English,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
 is emanations.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
 So emanation forms, emanation.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
 So what is emanation?

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
 This emanation is the emanation of the sambokaya.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
 And what is sambokaya?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:52.000
 The sambokaya is the embodiment of the blessfulness and the worship.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
 Blessfulness, worship and compassion, that is sambokaya.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000
 And that emanation, the emanation is also now same thing,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000
 emanation of the loving kindness, compassion and worship,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
 outreaching to benefit all living beings.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
 So that is the general meaning of the narmakaya.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000
 In our mind level, what is narmakaya of the nature of the mind?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
 Then again, a simple way to explain.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
 It's our love, our kindness, compassion,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.000
 toward arising and benefiting and helping to the other beings as much as we can.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000
 According to our capabilities, according to the readiness of others,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.000
 if you help to benefit in that, that is, that is the narmakaya call it is,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:52.000
 that is unceasing call it, that arising from the sambokaya

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
 or the darmakaya and the benefit to the others.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
 That is the sambokaya meaning, or the narmakaya meaning.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
 So that is in there.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:10.000
 So that means, Gurbamma sambhava is embodiment, embodiment of the three jewels,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.000
 embodiment of the three roots, embodiment of the three kayas.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
 And then what is Gurbamma sambhava?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:26.000
 So Gurbamma sambhava is Buddha that who is embodiment of four kayas and five worship.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
 That is.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
 So then when we pray this,

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
 when we do this prayer to Gurbamma sambhava,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
 so we will be praising to Gurbamma sambhava,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.000
 all the call it, all the realizations, all the achievements,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
 and then we finally asking to, to fulfill all these wishes,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
 the one after another, that explaining, and teaching says.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
 So then I will go tomorrow, this rest, and I will go tomorrow.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:01.000
 And, and then together with I'm going to go, go over the prayers of the Ishin Sodya's prayer,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:08.000
 which is written by very famous, again, famous great master, Pippin Karmapas.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000
 Of course, all the Karmapas are great masters throughout his stories.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
 But this Pippin Karmapas is also very famous great Karmapa,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
 and he was also one of the great thetums.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
 It came also same time of the post-anchancy,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
 post-control, and the Choyal Dunga.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.000
 And he was disciples of the post-anchancy and the post-controls.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
 So this was his teaching.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
 I will go over that too tomorrow.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
 But this again, this to some sambhava prayer, among that,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
 this first one, what we're discussing today here,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000
 here is the to some sambhava prayer, as I said.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
 It is really so powerful, powerful practices about this time.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.000
 And then also, as I told the truth, this time,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
 the year is changing, kind of, it's come to now,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
 end of the year 2021, and the beginning of the year 2002.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
 So in this junction, junction, we do some prayers

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
 and connect to the work of the Sambhava, and with the prayers of the to some sanya,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
 I think it's really very beneficial to every level, to ourselves,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
 to all the beings, to the world peace, and to dispel

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
 all the difficulty, troubles that everybody is going.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
 Generally, in the samsara, there is always some troubles.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000
 Always there is trouble, and there is nothing unusual there.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000
 But however, at this time, it looks like more than what we saw in our lifetime,

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
 more kind of things like that.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
 It's not just one, it is happening globally, kind of, really happening.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
 So I think what we can, there is so many people, those powerful ones,

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
 doing so many good things to prevent the two kinds of, ease the situation.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
 But from our side, at least we do the prayer,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
 and really cultivate both each other, and pray to Gurbam Sambhava.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
 And then Gurbam Sambhava is also known as the Buddha of the Degeneration.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.000
 Among the old Buddhas, Gurbam Sambhava is the Buddha of the Degeneration time,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
 and it's so powerful, swept.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
 Among the old female Buddhas, Tara is the swept, powerful Buddha,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
 all the time action Buddha.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
 So there is always the teaching said that pray to Gurbam Sambhava,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
 and pray to Tara, and then to the Charyasas is always really good.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
 With those thoughts, we do some practices, and I think it's wonderful.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
 And again, now we do just this Tisav Sahni prayer,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:53.000
 only maybe three, maybe, yeah, we do this, I think you have the Tisav Sahni prayer in English,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
 we do first three times, or four times in a little bit,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:05.000
 and then three times in English, that makes seven times of the Tisav Sahni prayer that we can do.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:12.000
 We just feel the strong presence of the Gurbam Sambhava,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
 and all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are lineage masters,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
 and the Gurbam Sambhava is also not different from the Buddha Shakyamuni.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
 And so all the Buddhas were three times, as we explained,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000
 so really, as we went through, so feel that presence as blessings of the Gurbam Sambhava,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000
 and then Nithyan.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:07.000
