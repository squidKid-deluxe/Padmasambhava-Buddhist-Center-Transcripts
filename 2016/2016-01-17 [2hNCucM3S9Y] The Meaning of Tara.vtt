00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 Oh no, liberators. It has many meanings. One meaning is liberators. What liberator? What are you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.960
 going to convert, like taking up or liberated?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:26.480
 Liberated from all the difficulties, troubles, challenges, and the liberating for all the cause of

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.000
 the trouble and the challenges.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.560
 What is the Buddha teaching called? It is our negative emotions. Negative emotions. What are

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080
 negative emotions?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:51.230
 Loring, squeezing. I'm sorry. I've made big mistakes. I don't know how that came. Oh, oh, oh. What

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.440
 is negative emotions? Completely opposite what I said.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.320
 So you must correct me, too, as I go. Because we are all Sangha members, really, through the Sangha

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.750
 members. But the meaning of the Sangha members in the Buddha teaching supports each other, helps

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.440
 each other, to their part, their understanding, and moving forward.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:27.910
 That is the meaning of the Sangha members. So put that, put, "You have 100% right to help me." What

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:36.440
 is negative emotions? Negative emotions are ignorance, anger, and attachment.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 These are the fundamental cause, root of the difficulty, troubles, and challenges in our lives.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 And that ignorance, attachment, anger, combination is called what? Ego. Ego-clinging. Ego-clinging

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 is the, like, bowl of, just bowl of emotions, as suggested.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:17.750
 Then ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, and arrogance. And then self-important, self-centered

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 mind.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.520
 This is the fundamental cause of all the challenges and difficulties that what we go through, what

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.440
 every other living beings go through, and look to the end of the world.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.960
 When we read in the gospel, when we watch television, how many sufferings are going in the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.440
 different places? Where that started? It's not started with love.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.400
 It not started with compassion. It not started with understanding, respect, and opportunity, every

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.440
 living beings. It all started with these emotions.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:02.930
 We can see this, and we can see ourself. That's what. So, what Tara means? Liberating from these

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:11.440
 troubles, liberating that emotions, liberating that result of the emotion is difficult in troubles.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.410
 That is Mother Tara. That is Mother Tara. One is Absolute Mother Tara. Absolute Tara, Mother Tara

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.440
 is no other than compassion, loving kindness, and understanding.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 That is Absolute Mother. That is really Mother. That nourishes to us, nourishes to others.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.090
 Even our sorrow, when you generate that love and compassion, it nourishes us. It brings

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.440
 satisfaction, joy, peace, happiness, something that you feel I did something good.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.440
 It's rewarding. Very uplifting. That is Mother Tara's nature.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.440
 This Mother Tara is not just outside. It's really right here.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 But what we are going to learn is that because of the Mother Tara, the externally enlightened

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.890
 beings, the living Mother Tara will help us to bring these qualities and bloom that full bloom

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.440
 status, blooming up or lighting up that qualities.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.490
 That is the really the Mother Tara nature. Nature and the qualities. So, that is what we are going

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.440
 to discuss. This is what we are going to learn these days.
