00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Thank you, good afternoon, thank you to H.H.Delis, and welcome everyone, thank you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 Again, we're going to strengthen our beautiful motivation of the joy and appreciation, and then

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.000
 both each other.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 The vastness, the motivation of both each other, and as well as the three major states of the Vaj

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.000
rayana teaching.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Vajrayana home, Vajrayana song, and Vajrayana mind and space.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.840
 And we activate the beautiful motivation, and then we're going to collect again the teachings by Y

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.000
apji Dunu,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 and we are continually going on these topics.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.330
 And now we discussed this vast time, we discussed those basic views of how the samsara is, and how

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.000
 samsara are.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 And we went through those four different forms, which is also known as the whole training of the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.000
 mind.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.140
 Those are the basic general teachings, and this is not, as I said many times, this is not just a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 kind of like extraordinary teachings.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.650
 But it's very common, this general knowledge of the way the samsara is, all samsara are operating

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.000
 over what nature is.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.630
 It's very important to know, because this is again nothing to do with religions or not, but it is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.000
 related to our day to day life situation.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.920
 So I think it's very good to become more familiar, more knowledgeable, the situation and the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 circumstances, and that is according to Buddhism that is a wisdom.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 You know where things are, it's important.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And once we have an understanding, then we are allowed to train our mind, which is also known as

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 following the path, path to truth.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 So we are following the path. That means we like to change the samsara situation, or we like to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.000
 change our perception and conceptions of the samsaras.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And those are depends. You like to change that completely, or you like to transform that.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 And reality in the very inner teaching or the Mahayana teaching, there is nothing need to be

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 changed externally, but we have to change our attitude or our mind.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And that when we change our mind or the attitude or the perception, then samsara is fine. Why?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Samsara is nirvana. There's nothing really anything wrong. It is perfect.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:31.230
 But because of our grasping, clinging, and habitification that we accumulated so many lifetimes, we

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.000
 spoiled our perceptions.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 We spoiled our conceptions. That we do often in our lives too.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Many times, it turned our own perception against our will. Will. And clashing between these two.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Will, our own will, will, and our own perception are really clashing. Both are our mind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:15.170
 But this twisted mind of duality is so funny, and so tricky, and so stubborn, and it will always

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 make trouble to our own self.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Even we didn't notice those things. Those things, in reality, we're making our self these troubles.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Similarly, when we proceed of the samsara, then it turned in a way. Perception is self-tuned to us.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So, now, what in Buddhism said? We have to change the perception. We have to change our mind.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.260
 When we change our mind, reveal it is natural, and release the habit patterns, and those kind of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.000
 attitude,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 then all the environment will become more clear, more bright, more simple, more beautiful,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 beautiful.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:26.440
 And this world goes on and on as we purify our own perceptions. And that is known as the following

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.000
 path, practicing.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.980
 And this is a natural bone beauty that we're revealing from this. This is not going to become

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.000
 addicted.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 This is not going to lead us to more headaches, because it's our in-bone beauty and nature,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:56.160
 and it is our in-bone discovery of our own potential, our goodness, and all the beautiful skills,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.000
 the methods,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.780
 and the creative abilities, understanding, knowledge are really shining everything, like bloom as

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.000
 spring.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 It just comes. This spring must be arising from the within, from our mind.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That is what beauty of the nature of the mind, or the beauty of the mind is inconceivable, vastness

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 that we should reveal.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 So that is really what we are talking about, turning the mind toward dharma, or following the path,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 the path of truth.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 That truth, what we're the regular teachers, Buddha has given us as a path of truth.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.160
 This is the truth, and we follow with this, and we follow with this. It will bring the truth, the

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.000
 result.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 It's not going to deceive us or let us down again, as in samsara does. It won't let us down.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.270
 It really will make stronger, it will make more courageous, more committed, more reduced in joy and

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.000
 confidence.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 All this will come. So therefore, that is known as truth.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Follow with the path of truth will bring the cessation of truth.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Cessation of truth means all habeke patterns are removed, now ceased.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 All habeke patterns, all negativeities, all those impurities are completely ceased, finished, gone.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Then what is? Then true sunshine will arise, and it will shine all the time.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Never going to setting, setting, or never going, it will always shine.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 And that is known as cessation of truth. Path of truth will bring the cessation.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 So now, when you follow the path of truth, then what in the Buddha's teaching, take the rafuddhi.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Those are two poems. Take rafuddhi into the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sanghas.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And now, the call, and rafuddhi is the foundation of the entire Buddha's teachings.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.760
 All the vows, and initiations, and transmissions, and blessings, all the really best of the rafudd

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.000
hi.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.560
 But the call of rafuddhi is, as I said, what the great master Vermaal Makara highlighted of the two

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.000
 things.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 One is fear, or the tired, and the bored, and the other is then devotions, or the pared.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 So pared and devoured, as well as tired of samsara, will be the cause of the rafuddhi.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And then, a day, and how we develop the pared.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Pared, and those are then highlighted by the great master Yumi Nampa.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.130
 And he said, contract with his spiritual friend, that also he applied spiritual teachers, or

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.000
 qualified spiritual teacher.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And he accompanied or associated him with his spiritual friend.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.100
 And then, remembering the call of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, or reading the books of the

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.000
 Buddha's teachings.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And then, fourth one, and then samsara, the situation.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.150
 Those we already discussed, of those four, the known section, thought, or point, that will change

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.000
 the mind.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 So those are all known as the cause of the pared.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So once we develop those, we do a pared.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 And again, pared is so important, I make quite few stories, and as well as you know.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 You all know those stories.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 And then, again, I talk about maybe one more of that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Pared is so important.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Important, if you have, even it is, how many different paves?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.850
 The interesting pared, desired pared, pared of a desire, and then trusty pared, and then, final one

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.000
, unshakable pared.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 So among that, each of those has a big power, and we really have that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Each of those.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Of course, that all will go deeper and deeper and deeper, or stronger and stronger.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So that means that this desire of pared is more stronger than the interesting pared.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.270
 According to Buddha's teaching, how we develop the desire of pared, that you develop, because of

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.000
 course, of course, you have to have interestings.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 You have to inspire yourself, or interest pared.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Once you do have the interest pared, then you have more curiosity to explore.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 So according to Buddhism, then you study.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.760
 You're studying and contemplating. Starting or reading books on the Buddha's teaching will develop

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.000
 the desirable pared.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 It will bring that. It will inspire you stronger.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Once you have the desire of pared, then you will develop the third one, trusty confidence.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:06.150
 That, in the Buddha's teaching, says you will develop by contemplating on the teachings, studying

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.000
 and contemplating,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 and then also practicing that will bring confidence, trusty pared.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.940
 Once you have developed that pared, third one, develop, then if we continually study and practice

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.000
 meditating and contemplating,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 it will bring the fourth one, uncheckable.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Uncheckable pared is maybe similar terminology if I use it at the world level, loyalties.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.660
 You become loyalty to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and you become loyalty to your practice, or one's

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.000
 own practice.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.730
 You're now really outpouring that. You see the value and importance, you're not going to give up

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.000
 any reasons.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Because it's good for me, it's good for the others, it is absolutely good from the beginning,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.720
 good in the middle, and good in the ending, it has good value, and therefore, this is my long last

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.000
 apprenticeship

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 until I read the Enlightenment or finally discover.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.620
 So you become very loyalty in a normal language, and the teaching makes it impaliable, impaliable

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.000
 reference, or devotion, impaliable reference.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Now, with that, then, now you take reference.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And generally, in Buddhism, when you take reference, these two causes are very general.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 That's because, again, I'm going to remind this, tired with samsara and pared,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 or some degree pared to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that is a cause of reference.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 But in Mahayana, added one more, which is compassion.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.050
 So that means, in Mahayana, has three. So, tired of the samsara and pared to the Buddha, Dharma,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.000
 Sangha,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 then fundamental cause or that is cause of taking reference is compassion.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.620
 What that means? That is, according to Mahayana teaching, you see the situation and the

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.000
 circumstances in the samsara.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Every living being is going through all the challenges.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Everyone is running to achieve some degree of the peace and happiness or desirable things.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Running, everyone is really running, in a way, all the time.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 But yet, they're not achieving everything what they want. Always it's stronger.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.830
 Always it looks like kind of bouncing to the rocky mountains, not really going through exactly as

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.000
 you want it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And then, when they're experiencing, they're bouncing to the rocky mountains or the sand mountains,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 climbing up the sand mountains, they're not comfortable.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 So therefore, feel great compassion.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Feel compassion. All living beings are really sincerely led to help.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 All the beings, therefore, I'm going to take whatever method I need to develop,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 skills to benefit, to help with things, to all these beings.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.060
 Sincerity having that attitude in the mind and heart and then take reference in the Mahayana

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.000
 teaching.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 So compassion is the very fundamental force behind taking refuge.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Along with some really unknown situation, the circumstances of samsara

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 and the rest of the joy of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, then you take reference.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And how long we take this refuge? How long are we going to kill?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Until we become the enlightenment, our self.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 That means, until we discover full our potential.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 In other words, full potential of nature, of our own Buddha nature.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Fully is wet up. Until then, I go to reference.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 What that means? Until then, then you don't go.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Then according to the teaching, you yourself or each of us become as object of refuge.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 You reach the ultimate goal of the refuge, become the Buddha.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 You full potential, discover the potential and from that on, that means you discover full potential

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.560
 full quality of Dharma, Kaya nature. From that on, now you're going to benefit for all living

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.000
 beings.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Like Rupa Kaya or the day I mentioned, of course you all know.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And how are you going to help? Until every living being is rich in enlightenment.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Everyone. And those I mentioned earlier, and again I'm sure you know that.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 They say that then there is pervasive continuation,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 spontaneous way to go and benefit all living beings

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 until they reach their final goal or until they reach,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 discover their final potential in the Buddha world.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 They are going to benefit.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So that is the reason, the idea of the technique.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Here, Japjie Dunurmud said, said that rafuddhi like imperious work in here.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Again, if I read this, of course you have this.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 This, this trusting that three jewels are the imperious source of rafuddhi.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 So that is your taking rafuddhi.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Now, how we take rafuddhi? Generally, of course, of course you take rafuddhi.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Rafuddhi is within master, lineage master or the spiritual friend gave a healing.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Spiritual friend, you take rafuddhi.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Once you take rafuddhi with that, that means you are connected to the lineage.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 You are connected to the lineage.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 You are now put the first step on the path to enlightenment

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 or you are in the path true. You put or we put.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Or we are now right on the, we cross the border of the samsara and nirvana.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 When we talk the rafuddhi, we are crossing the border of the samsara to the nirvana states.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 That is really the beginning.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Beginning, we try to rafuddhi.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 From onto that own, when you try to talk the rafuddhi, then you always take your self rafuddhi.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 You should do that.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Often, every day, every time, every you can do.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Those are the teachings said, fill the presence of the nirvana sambhava

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 who is the important part of all of the rafuddhi.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 That means Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru, Deva, Dakinis and Dharma Kaya, Sambokaya.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 The Maa Kaya Buddha or whatever name, but Guru Pembrokhi is,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Guru Pembrokhi is embodiment of all those of the rafuddhi.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 And what that means? Again, Guru Pembrokhi is embodiment of the loving kindness,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 compassion, wisdom that has ever existed in the world

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 or well existed or it is now.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 All come together in one form as Guru Pembrokhi sambhava.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 And Guru Pembrokhi sambhava is also, as I said,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 embodiment of all the teachers.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 The teachers, you have personal connections, you have spiritually connected to you.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 It is embodied by that.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Because your personal friend, personal spiritual friend,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 they are your friend because their kindness, their wisdom, their knowledge,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 their understanding, they share it to you or inspire somebody.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 That is what really we are known as the friends.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 So Guru Pembrokhi sambhava is embodiment of all those kind friends,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 supporters in one form.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 And then, Guru Pembrokhi sambhava is transcendental, west of rainbow body.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Rainbow body of loving kindness, compassion and wisdom.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And Guru Pembrokhi sambhava embodiment of all the Buddhas come in the past.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 That includes the Buddha Shakta Malimas.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 All the Buddhas now, that includes such as the Vedya Satvas,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 and Sambhavas, and Amitavas, Amogas, Siddhas, all five Dayana Buddhas,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 five male Buddhas, five people Buddhas.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 And all Buddhas will come in the future.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 All come one token, at a single state as Guru Pembrokhi sambhava.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And Guru Pembrokhi sambhava is sitting right in front of your sky.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 That may be far or like this, or all may be ten, fifteen pieces

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 kind of way in your distance right in front of the sky.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Beautiful trees, beautiful trees, that dual tree.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 And it has about five branches.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 On the central branch of the pull of the lotos,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Guru Pembrokhi sambhava sitting on the sun and moon dressers, sun and moon dressers, lotos and sun

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 and moon dressers.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Looking to us with eye of loving kindness, compassion, and welcoming to us.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And smiling with very joyful, warmly receiving eyes.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, all the lineage masters.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 One after another, different poems, different gestures.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 And right side of Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, or right in front of Guru Pembrokhi sambhava,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 depends with the different lineage masters according to their instructions.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 But in front side, according to his whole religion and structure,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 all the Yidam deities, such as Vidyakalayas and as well as Hayagiwas,

 or of Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, facing to us.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And the right side of Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, there's all the Buddhas.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Buddhas of one thought and Buddhas welcome, or came and welcomed,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And left side of Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, all the great bodhisattvas,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 even their different gestures, different forms.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 Above the Guru Pembrokhi sambhava, I think I already said,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 all the linear masters, Dzokhi lineage masters,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000

 and as well as all the thetans, and all those kamal lineage masters,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 thema lineage masters, everyone is above Guru Pembrokhi sambhava.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Even though Guru Pembrokhi sambhava represent all of that in one single form,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Vayat is surrounded by all these enlightened beings.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Even though there's a lot of different forms,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 gesture, color, and all that reality, they all are the same nature.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Full of love, full of compassion, full of wisdom,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 full of power and abilities of love and kindness and compassion,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 wisdom, to help to ask to all the beings.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Everyone is emanating light of love and compassion, wisdom,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 healing light to ask to all the beings of six realms.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 In front of that you, and then as well as all our lovers,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 our family members, friends, and the neighbors,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 and all the beings of six realms are right in front of us.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And everyone is so joyful, calm, beautiful,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 separate, dominant, gesture of the, gesture of the respect of the body,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 their heart, what's called the hand of the heart center,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 this is called the gesture of the respect of the body.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And gestures of the respect of the speech,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 joining the prayers, so melodious and beautiful.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And gestures and respect of the mind is full of devotions,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 full of pain, really closely connected

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 without doubt and hesitations.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And a giant reference to prayers as we do.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 All giant, seven line prayers.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 That way we guide all the time.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 The home or the origin of that.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 That's seven line prayers.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 This seven line prayer that as we guide it every day,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 is maybe two times each session.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Here we guide it, this is known as one of the most powerful prayers

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 known as the Bhagavatam Sambo,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 It's really very powerful.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 It is, Kenji Parthishara much mentioned many times,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 it is, if we even join that, it is ruffled, it is both each other.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 It is among the blessings.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 It is among the power and blessings of the Gurbel Lama Sambo

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 and mandaling Gurbel Lama Sambo to your own heart

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 with confidence and a job.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 It's truly, it is so powerful.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 This is like just every teaching.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 All the Dharma teachings,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 it just echoes this teaching since the beginning time,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 or in the 11th century, until now.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 So many thetans of those great masters

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 revere the same line, same world, these seven line prayers.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 And can you remember?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Can we, we can, you can imagine them.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 So many practices, giant displays, same thing,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 with full of their devotions, relaxations, really giant

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 and completely purified their obscuration

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 and more the power and blessings of Gurbel Lama Sambo.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Sambo.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And Gurbel Lama Sambo himself said,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 these seven line prayers is like,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 involve the power and the urge in the call of me, me.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Whoever calls me with the seven line prayers,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 with devotion, I will be there.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Really, he's mentioned.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 So many of those great practitioners

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 have witnessed the power of this in the past.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 It's just a renowned one.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 So we are on that line.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 We're giant displays.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And that is so you can do a rough prayer

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 or a simple seven line prayer, giant in that.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And you do that.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 And during that time, whether you're giant displays,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 and then so many blessings like coming from Gurbel Lama Sambo,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 come Sambo to us, to all the beings.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And those blessings, the lights are coming.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Form of lights, all forms of syllables,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 form of the Gurbel Lama Sambo himself, big and small,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 and form into light forms, of course, rainbow lights.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And such is the big and size of the Gurbel Lama Sambo

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 as like just kind of snowing or the showering down to us.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And to every pore, it's our "Aa" and those blessings.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And the form of the syllables,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 such as Om, Ah, Om, Bejal, Guru, Lama Sambo,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 all are simply Om, Ah, Homs, White Om, Red Ah, Blue Ah,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 all those are coming, like showering,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 going to every pore, our bodies,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 every pore of the all living beings,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 purifying all the disease,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 sicknesses, contagious disease,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 virus that is completely disappearing there

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 and healed up everything and not just more than that,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 completely revered their potential, enlightenment natures,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 completely ready.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 And from that, Om, their love and kindness and compassion,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 skillful means and courage and commitment completely everywhere,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 as sun is shining completely, really feel that.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And they feel that.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And with that, reciting mantra.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Always reciting the mantra or reciting prayers

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 or reciting the rafuti prayers.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 And also, you will, you're joined in several line prayer

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 or rafuti prayer, you can, according to teaching,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 you can regulate every sentence, means adjoining, same thing.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 All joined with you.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 All.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 In the Buddha's teaching, expanding mind is so important.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Expanding.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Mind is big as a space.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Even in the teaching, it's bigger than space.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 But we shrink ourselves by joining, misunderstanding.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 So therefore, open the heart, open the mind.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Bring the vastness of the mind as it has.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 And every living being is a chanting.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Every living being is upholding their heart center

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 with calm and peaceful, respectfulness.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 And respectful of the chanting and the prayers.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Respectfully of the love and compassion,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 so overwhelming in their heart.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 This is known as the taking love or practicing guru yoga,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 mingling the guru or the Buddha nature to your own natural mind.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Mad mind.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And then finally, when you're going to conquer the practices,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 there's a slightly different kind of instruction.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So now our fourth one is that so many blessing lights are coming

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 from all the of you will have with you that you will have your light.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And as well as from Birkheim symbol, all blessing lights come into you.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 And to all the beings, purify completely all the obscurations,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 obstacles, diseases, sickness in everything, habit dependence.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 All are completely purified.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 And finally, that moment, then you dissolve yourself now.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 All the sentient beings are dissolved into light

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and that merge to the old autographals.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 And then, that old autograph, everything dissolved to the Gurbam symbol

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 and the Gurbam symbol dissolved to the vastness state of the Dharmadhatu

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 or the Dharmadhatu.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 And that's the one way to do the practices.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 The other way to continue the practices,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 receive all the blessings, continue when you recite a mantra.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 And all those masters, assembly masters,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 the witches surrounding Gurbam symbol

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 finally dissolved to Gurbam symbol.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And Gurbam symbol were dissolved to the free syllable

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 or a small sphere of light like this.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Small sphere, the size of the pea, pea, pea,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 and the size of the pea is like very natural,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 is like totally the blissfulness of the emptiness

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 and that dissolved to your heart center.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And that moment, then you meditate on the non-duality, non-dual,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 non-consultant status, if you can pour whatever your time is.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Three minutes, five minutes, ten minutes.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 So that is really known as the text, the raffles.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 That you can do, once you talk the raffles,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 already with the lineage spiritual masters,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 then you can take that again and again, do that again.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Renewing is always important.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And that is actually also known as practicing,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 keeping the practicing, keeping the flame continually

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 and not let go away, keeping that.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Inspire ourselves in the continuity.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Keep the freshness of the energy of the practices.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Then resolve will come.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 So that is the briefly talk of this general text reference.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 And then I talk really about this again,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 devotion, as we said, is so important.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 As I said yesterday, story of the Ashoka, young boy,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 that devotion is an interesting devotion.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 That because he is seeing the Buddha, he inspired,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 when Buddha and his students are coming,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 he inspired, he immediately organized,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 he offered his from the treasure department

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 or whatever he named, and offered his handful

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 of the treasure to Buddha.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And that is an interesting devotion.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 And that brought such huge results.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 There is many stories.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Then, when interested, he had that devotion.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Then desirable devotion also has a big benefit,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and then also trusty devotion.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Then all the pair developed, as I said, the story of the Kumbhumbi.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Kumbhumbi, that is the trust.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 He completely trust that center a lot in the Lasas,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 as cathedral, the famous Buddha.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 He really thought he is a living Buddha.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 He never had any second thought of his stage or not.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 He just thought he came with attitude.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 He saw that way, and he received that big blessings the same way.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And there is another story that in the words of my perfect teacher,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 many of you read, I just want to say again one that.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And that is like that story that is the son of the one lady,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 well, her son, he was marching the story that he usually goes,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 not usually, often he goes to India to do the business.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 He said his mother was very devoted to the Buddha.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And always thought, my son is going to India,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 he must should bring some relax or blessed object from Buddha

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 because India is the holy land of the Buddha.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And the Buddha was born and gave the teaching and all that.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So he always had that expectation.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 He asked her three times, each time he forgot that to do.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 And then finally she said, he didn't bring anything.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 So then finally she said, when you go this time,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 you don't bring anything to me as a blessing from India,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 as my object of commemoration, I will die right in front of you if you don't bring.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 So really she made that statement.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 So now her son is returning from the trip from India.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 India, it is an authority close to their houses.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Suddenly he remembered what his mother asked him.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 So he didn't feel so bad, not what to do.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 And then he had not converted what he told what to do.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 And he is looking around right nearby him.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 So there is like dog's head, dog's head, dry dog's head, head there.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And he thought, I'm going to take some from this dog's head.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 So he pulled the truth of the dogs from the dog's head

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 and he wrapped that with silk, nice broken silk.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 And then he told, I'm going to tell to my mom,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 this is Buddha's truth that I'm going to tell and give to him that.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 So he really did that.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 So then he arrived back to home.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Mother asked, do you bring anything from India for my object of commemoration?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Anything there? And then he said, yes, I brought very special to you.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 And the Buddha's truth, I brought you truth.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And he's so happy, so excited, really, she's so happy.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 And he put that on auto, auto, and she's practicing the praying.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 She never had any doubt and hesitations.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 She really taught this is Buddha's truth.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Because of all of her trusted prayer or imperative of prayer,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 in the teachings, the bliss of the Buddha, Shatya Muni,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 entered in that dog's teeth and is coming light, rainbow lightness.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Many beautiful things are really kind of showing up sign.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 And she's so happy and so devoted.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 She continually practiced and offering to them.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 And in the teachings said, when she died, she died with sign of realization,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 peacefully, happy, and rainbow light came to her body or the dog's teeth.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 So this is the power of the devotions, the power of the prayer.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Even it's not exactly Buddha's teeth, but when you have that trust,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 confidence, borrowed mind, joined the blissness of Buddha, Shatya Muni,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 transformed the dog's teeth into Buddha's relaxed truth.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 So that is really the story. How important of these prayers are.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 If we don't have the prayer, it doesn't matter whoever there

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 is not going to gain any result, any benefit.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Again, there's so many stories throughout these stories.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 But I tell one thing, that is in Buddha's time.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Buddha is totally enlightened.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 There's nothing higher realization, achievement,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 and discovery than Buddha did.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 It's full of love and full of compassion.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 But for example, there are so many people who did not have any joy

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 or the devotion, close feeling to the Buddha during Buddha's time.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 But this is one of the examples.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 He's one of the relatives known as Lekwakana.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Buddha has his own relatives, Lekwakana.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Lekwakana.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Lekwakana, Buddha becomes very capable, he doesn't want to teach it.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Somehow, he came to Buddha and told all natures.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 He said, "Tell all natures."

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And Buddha came, he stayed close with Buddha.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 But he always told, "We both are equal, because the bones same climb."

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Climb?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 "And I know Buddha don't have any better quality than himself," Lekwakana, he told.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 "I know what Buddha is talking or teaching, I know the same thing."

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Same thing.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 "What did you have?"

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 "You don't have any extra things."

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 "We are equal, except one thing," he said.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 He had, later on, a bigger aura that I see.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 He had a bigger aura, but the other day, he and I were equal.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And one time, he left, he said.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 At the end, he said, "I've been with you so many years,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 but I don't see any good quality about you.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 I'm going to leave."

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 So he left.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 So these are the stories.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 If you don't have them, pay it.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Even if you are sitting right in front of the church.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Create noble beings, enlightened beings.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 You won't get any benefit.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 It is like known as turning the cave, turning the cave or bowl

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 in the other side of the mountain or the northern side of the mountain.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 There is no sunlight or heat.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Even the sun is shining equally, but when the bowl is on the northern side,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 the facing bowl, B-O-W-A, I think, is so cool.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Facing to the northern side, sunlight never goes in.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Even it is present, so similar.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 And there are so many stories like that, and you know it's not something.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 Mysteries.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 When you don't have the really connection of openness, open heart and mind,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 you will know that is the calling of there is not going to see, not going to receive.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 And therefore, so this devotion is so important.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Once you got the pain, and that is known as open door of the path of truth,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 path of enlightenment.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 That is what it is.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 That is my brief talk for today.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 And thank you very much again for joining me and listening my broken English.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 And thank you so much, everyone.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Really thank you.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And I am very appreciative and very, very appreciative and honored of your patient.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 Honored to your patient.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Patient in your standing and listening again with me.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 Thank you.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Thank you.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Thank you.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Thank you very much, everybody.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Thank you.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Okay.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Now we do short meditation again.
