00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 He is taught about others. Other is Shaqar Tsoruradu, and his short name is Shaqar, his full name

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.000
 is Tsoruradu.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.160
 He is now talking about him. He is one of the great renowned yogi, meditation, Dzogchen masters in

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 the 18th century.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:49.990
 However, he is more of a hermitic star. Hermit did not encounter more academic levels than that.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000
 Also, in a way, he was born.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.850
 He was born in Eastern Tibet. He is generally divided into three provinces, upper province, middle

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 province and very low province.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 Upper provinces are divided, such as wu and zang and du. All these are upper regions, from the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 mountain glass to the dasa, dasa-e, all that majority, northwest part of Tibet, is known as the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.000
 upper part.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 The lower part of Tibet is divided in the two centuries, particularly this time, more divided than

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 this time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.230
 The Khan and the Amdus. The Khan is all of the Eastern Tibet. The majority part of the Eastern

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.000
 Tibet is known as Khan.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 But then, the part is the part, close the border of China, and that, again, big range, the range

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:10.000
 area is the Amdu and the block area.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.420
 So, the Tibetan map, if you look at this hand, like this hand, and this way, this whole part is the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.000
 upper part of Tibet.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.690
 So, that is lasa and all that. Lasa and zang, this whole area is birthplace of the Tibetan culture,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.000
 birthplace of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.370
 Where there is all those great danokins are ruled in Thailand, Tibetans, and beyond the Tibetan

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:50.000
 Thailand, tourists, the ex-centuries, all come that area.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.220
 So, therefore, culturally, religiously, spiritually, every kind of border talks about all the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.000
 center Tibet is the very center, the goal of the cultural civilization and langons.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And religions, the Buddhism, everything comes from there. So, that is lasa, all that, India.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Then, Eastern Tibet is then, as I said, the divided in the two sections, particularly these times.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.980
 I said, Middle and Far East. Middle, bottom, those far, which is now this upper part is those all

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.000
 that I said.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And now, this divided in this half is then come, Eastern Tibet, come, come back to that.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And this part is then, the Andu and Golok area.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So, Hyakkah was born in Andu, Andu area, Andu, which is, this time, kind of the connected border,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Golok and Andu border, two different religions.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And this is where Hyakkah was born.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.820
 And Hyakkah's area, generally, the Hyakkah area, that Andu area, kind of like mostly is among the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.000
 poor schools of Tibet, Buddhism is mostly Galapras.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Galapras region is very popular in that Andu areas.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.040
 But however, there's slightly area, area called Rekong, Rekong, Rekong, I think R-A-R-E, sorry, C-K

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.000
-O-N-T, Rekong, maybe, this is just pronunciation.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Rekong area, that is very renowned.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Napa, Napa place, that made Nima, mostly like lay practitioners.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Lay practitioners, always kind of ancient of those people who come from Rekong area, go to Thassa.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.840
 Everybody in it, where they go to Thassa and pay homage to the Buddha, Shatamuni, very famous, very

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.000
 blessed places, and go to that places.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.980
 And so many times Rekong comes also in our area, because my place is a calm area, and many times

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.000
 people come back to Thassa, go to that place.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Mine is kind of in this area.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 So they go this way.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.150
 Always my father used to say that Rekong's are kind of so much like Napa, they always took long

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.000
 hairs, and hairs also, what's called this?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Oh, God, very different.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Gravit, Gravit or what's called?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Radlax.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Radlax.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Rage, almost kind of, each is two hairs of toghed become toghed.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Radlax.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.320
 Yeah, I saw sometimes in New York City, there's like food from the government too, so they didn't

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.000
 come back to it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 There's a lot of problems. So they all come with really kind of very, also sometimes they keep the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 conchial earrings.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.820
 They keep the white conchial earring, and hairs are tied up and also falling down, and with walking

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.000
 stairs,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.740
 because always Rekong's very good practice of the Napa, like such as two stages, creating stage in

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.000
 a complete stage practice.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Therefore, they achieve a lot of, realize that he has a reputation.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.280
 They were kind of very powerful, very, very powerful, and so should respect and appreciate when

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.000
 they come to their,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 they are asking, of course, this is a tradition which is established by something humble.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 The travel is always supported by the families, wherever the village comes.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 So they keep the food, hospitality.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 But the Rekong Papas came when they said it's always good to have connection to them.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 They say that.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 But anyway, this Chapa was born in that age.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 He was born, I think, in a regular family, family, regular family.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And his father and mother's are kind of regular average Papa practitioners.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And when he was born, he was born in 18, sorry, 1781, 1781.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And when he was born, they named him named Mauen Trashe.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Mauen Trashe.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 His childhood name was Mauen Trashe, N-G-A-G-W-A-N-G, Mauen, and Trashe.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Trashe named him.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And he was very, very with the beautiful dreams.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Also, motherhood and also he was born.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 There's kind of nice, good signs in the cations that came.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And that year, they had a nice year of the harvest and all those things.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And many villages also kind of used, oh, this child got good name.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 That's exactly match this year, Clemety.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Clemety and good name because Trashe means acupitious, prosperity.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 So this year, that year, that Clemety weather level was so nice and all that.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 So they start talking, oh, this child has kind of name,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 similar with the situation what happened there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And so he's grown up and there's also in the life story,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 he has a lot of nice beautiful regions and dreams and so forth.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 And he began to see a lot of colors, a sparkling light in the sky and all that.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And mother said, that kind of baby, you must be hallucinating yourself.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Don't say those things.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Stay quietly, all those things.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 You yield it to those parents and you say those things.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 So they said that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 So he's grown up there.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And then he started to learn also very easily all the how to read, how to write,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 without any difficulty, without also properly really teaching constantly.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 The moment if they showed something how to read,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 he start reading so roughly and so quickly.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So everybody, oh, this boy is a very smart boy.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And Edwin, I'm sorry, when he was born,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 also there's very astrological that they ask, oh, please read astrology to my child.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 The parents ask, and this person made astrology and read made astrology.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And the astrology said, if he stay in the house,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 he will become one of the great warriors in our areas.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 If he leave the home, he will become one of the great yogis.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Yogis, that also mention that.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 So he's grown up and there, and he learned so easily all those things.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And also later, at 10, he started joining the makwa monasteries,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 joined and practicing.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Every makwa blade is kind of amongst us that, oh, he's really so good.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 He reads so well, he's doing good and all that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 So that all the older makwas start appreciating of it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 His knowledge, his wisdom, and also saying his character.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 It's kind of a nice character, good character, young child, very nice character.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 So everybody said, oh, he's beautiful, all that.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And on the end, Putin, he met all this in that area.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 One very zoky master, renowned zoky master teacher in that area,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 came to this monastery, the monastery invited him,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 and his name was Jabar Dorghe, and he gave a lot of zoky teachings,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 a lot of zoky teachings, a lot of meditation, instructions.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 And then finally, also when he's given the zoky teachings,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 this great master, zoky master, Jabar Dorghe, asked all the makwas.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Makwas said, believe everybody now must look to their nature of the mind,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 try to find the nature of the mind.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 He introduced that.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So everybody started looking the nature of the mind,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 and everybody has really difficult to understand

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 what the nature of the mind is.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 It has some difficulties, that is that.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 And then he asked also to him, Jabar,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 who is now an avantrache, child name is now an avantrache.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 He called him avantrache.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Young boy asked, do you recognize what is your nature of the mind?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And he said, no, I didn't understand what the nature of the mind is.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Oh, this master said, oh, this must be yours, because too young now.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 You will know that, but too young, you won't understand.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 But then this master, again giving more teachings

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 and more instructions and practice, literally the help,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 and then that he gave that and struck him again.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 And Jabar, I mean, this young avantrache,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 really began to understand what the nature of the mind.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 And one time he went to the teacher and he told what he delighted.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Or they said, oh, that is correct, we said.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And all the other lovers said, oh, you can understand.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 We still didn't struggle with what is the nature of the mind.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 This must have, we need to become a college man,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 free of this kind of something, that, but he understood.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 So, this is the first time that he received Zoki teaching

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 and various stomo-nima connections.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And only at the time, actually, he said,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 he was underlying devotion to the nima schools.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Even though that area, as I said,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 the majority were very, very kind of yellow for schools and all that,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 but he really, very much devotion toward the nima.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And also, that's what he joined with the master of makwas

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 and practiced journey with makwas.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And around that, at 17, so around that time,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 there is another great teacher that invited him.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 His name was Jami Jamso.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Jami Jamso, in the teaching, he said, he likes to say,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 he was master of both old and new schools.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 So, that means old school means nima schools, which were Buddhism.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 New school means then Gaju, Sajja, and the Gelobu schools.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 But also, I think, more leaning with the Gelobus.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 So, he's very master of the new one and the Gaju.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 But then, he came, he gave lot of teachings,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 teachings and empowerment, transmissions.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 And lot of those teachings, he really feel so kind of mind,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 become so calm, peaceful, devotional.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 All that become so strong.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 At all that time, he started practicing more about the Gauravayam Masambhava.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 He's been so strong during the Gauravayam Masambhava,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 he practiced over 12 million mantara Gauravayam Masambhava.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 He feel so many good about that and had a lot of beautiful dreams,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 one after another.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 At that time, around the age of 20s, around that time,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 this, the Jami Jamso, he become so close.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 He was also very special.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Spiritual teacher, teacher and become one of his root teachers.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And one day, he told, "What is your plans now?"

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 He's now at old age 20s, "What's your plans?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Are you thinking of marriage or what are your plans?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 What do you have plans on your life?"

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 He told that, "I have no plans to really get stay householders.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 I like to get old nation and I like to practice."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 He said, "That's a wonderful idea.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 One of the things, please, if you can do that, do that."

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And he said, "I wish you will do that and stay in the cave and meditate like that."

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 He got mad gesture of meditation, "Pochatok, short time,"

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 and then he smiled, smiled.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 And Japai himself said, "Maybe that is his projection that I will do like that."

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 That is.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So he feel so strongly that he like to be really ordained.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Because of that, those thoughts continue to carry in heart and mind.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 But soon after, these great teachers are also connected to this.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 This Japai himself, he passed away, passed away.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 But however, his instructions, he never forgot.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 He kept it so strongly.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And so now he's at age 20s, he like to take the old nation.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 He take the old nation.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Even the modern day, he feel that strongly his head reaches,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 but he take the old nations.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And then finally, finally, around that time,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 then there's one again very beautiful teacher.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Teacher Jang temple, I think it's called, Jang temple.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Temple in the area, he told finally,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 "I think you must go to see Maori Chudia," I think.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 His name is Maori Chudia, Japai.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Japai, that's the great, I think, teacher, Zokhi master,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 who looks like he is more connected to the Mongolian, Mongolian life stories.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Because these all kind of very locally, Lehigh in life,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 it's not really came very famously in the Nima history,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 the original.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 The record is so hidden in a way, masters in the locally area.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 So the Maori Chudia was, I think, in the closed Mongolian border,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and he was a householder.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 I think he was also in a way, I think, leader of the areas too.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 His household, his married man, married man, but he was great, ridiculous.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So he told, this Jang temple told, "You must go to see him, him, him, and the religious."

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 And the moment he heard his name, the Maori Chudia,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 said, "Shabbar, he's like old, balls of hell, really grown, come out, out."

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 He just make a shiver, shivering with the thought of the devotion and joy,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 eager to meet them soon.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 And then one day, this Jang temple himself going to some teaching,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 with his, also, authority and his disciples.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 So Shabbar joined with him and went to there, and he received the teachings

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 from this Maori Chudia.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 He gave many teachings of the Dzogchi teachings,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 and then, particularly also, teachings on the Haya Giva

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 and Vayayavara.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 He practiced. He received the old teachings.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 He gave the empowerment of the, the upper empowerment, inner empowerment,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 cigarette empowerment, absolutely empowerment of the Haya Giva and Vayayavara.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 One after another, grade you slowly by slowly and explain the meanings of that.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So that means, maybe didn't do all those empowerment.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 One day, one after another started to give teaching and structures gradually,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 and then, together, he also gave other teachings,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 teachings that deals with more renal sessions,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 such as the renal safety or the training of the mind,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 the precious human life, the empowerment of us.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 And cause and efforts are inevitable.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Sometimes, samsara has hard difficulty troubles. It's not just always the same.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 It's a chance.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Those are known as the best-seller's teachings.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 That also aligns with the very famous teaching of the famous master Tsongkhapati,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 the founder of a gala school, which is known as the graduation path

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 of the different stages of the, of the big and the medium

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 of the small practitioners or small capabilities.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It's called graduation teaching by Tsongkhapati, which is a very famous teaching.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Also, he taught those teachings, teachings to kind of connect more,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 to explore the meaning of life and these situations.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And his mind becomes so full of joy, full of devotion, love and compassion,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 that already he has done.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 This really dances that, that power and this siddly that qualities very strongly.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So it is all those teachings.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And then, as it is in these teachings, it's talking to all the zokki teachings.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 And particularly, this, generally, this farming areas,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 this, this shaka, this foreigner area is, again, one of the very famous schools,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 which will build, there's one great temple that came.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And many of you really heard that temple.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 And his name was Ratun Todhi Doji.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Ratun Todhi Doji was very, one of the very famous new materials,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Ratun Todhi Doji, who also came same time as Tsongkhapati.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Tsongkhapati, they asked, they are contemplating.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 They, what they call it?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Contemporarily.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Contemporarily.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 They are contemporaries.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And they said three daughters.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Three daughters, three crazy daughters.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Three crazy, crazy daughters.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Those are known as Ratun Todhi Doji.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 And Tsongkhapati, Tsongkhapati, another name is Namjia Doji.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Namjia Doji.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 And Rezi Tungchio Doji.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So, Todhi Doji, Namjia Doji, and Tungchio Doji.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Those are some of the new histories and they are named three crazy legends.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Three crazy legends.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 I think they are all crazy.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And they are all also connected.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 They are really connected.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 They are kind of in a way.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Decipheral students, they are all connected.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So, therefore, for example, this Tungchio Doji was the youngest one.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 And as we read some teachings of another teaching,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 because Tungchio Doji become one of the main lineage whores,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 the principal lineage whores of Tsangchio Doji.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So, and also many times in some histories,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Tungchio Doji was like the biological son of Tsangchio Doji.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 But anyway, Tungchio Doji was also one of the four recitals

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 of the lineage whores of Ratun Todhi Doji.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Ratun Todhi Doji's great teaching really so rapidly

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 and so strongly rooted in this "repo"

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 that how many churches were Shapa went.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Shapa is practicing.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 So, here is a lot of teaching of this Ratun Todhi Doji

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 and as well as Tungchio Doji's teaching, too.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And I think this higher guru and variety teaching

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 is also connected with this Ratun Todhi Doji.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I think so.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 That's in my case of Todhi.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 But anyway, here is all this teaching.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Teachings, and then this great master,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 this is Mamma Inchudya.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 He called it, now he go to the Hermitage.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Hermitage and you practice.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 So he practice.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Ever since, he started meditating and practicing.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 His realization is growing.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 His realization is deepening.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 All his life story tells of how he got advanced

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 and developed one after another.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 One after another, the tattoo practices,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 toga practices, all that rapidly grow.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And then, same time he did it.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So, all then, Pasasanga of the entire day

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 did teaching with the Buddha.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 So well, so beautiful.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Even though he didn't go exactly to study

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 in the academic level,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 but he discovered of the inner westerns.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 True westerns.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Then he discovered all those teachings.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Teachings.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And so he practiced a long time in that area

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 and then later on, he traveled all over.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 All over Tibet.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 From eastern Tibet, to then, to the other area,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 to the calm, and to Thassa.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 And then he went to multi-galatians.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And then he went to the government or the Nepal.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And when he paid homage to the three big stupas in Nepal,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 there's very famous three stupas.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 There's always Bolanat, Papashanku,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 and Dhamma.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 He lived in Tibet.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 These three stupas, he went and paid homage.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And then again, he came back,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 went to the same route in a way.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Then we came back to Thassa

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 and then gradually came back to his home town, homeland.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 So he did a long play of the government,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 but not just every day he went.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 In some areas, in Chari, in southern Tibet,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 he spent over a year meditating on the cave in the mountains.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Everything is a life story.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 How he went, what realization, what achievement he got,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 how he did.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 He beautifully sang the songs.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And many times, even the great masters,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 you see, he was like the incarnation of the Malarapas.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 The way he spent, the way he sang is very...

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And then even though he's fully over in the mountains,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 but he had long hair,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 he stayed as a papa, wearing white robes and long hair.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 And that's what he said.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So this is what he went.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Then he returned to his home back.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And in that way, there benefited so many beings.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Along the road, along the path,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 everywhere we went, at the end of the day,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 when he made it in the practice,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 everyone, please stay here,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 and beat our teacher, and all devoted.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 That's why so many beings, really, one after another,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 one after another, and then he returned, as I said.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Then he entered the Mahaparin Rana,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 I think in 1850, I think.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 You know, 1850.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So he was born in 1781,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 and entered the Mahaparin Rana,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 around 1850.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 So that means how much? How old?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Sixty-nine.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Sixty-nine? So around '69, I think.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Then he entered the Mahaparin Rana,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 around '69.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 And so that time, actually, that time already,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 who is there, the great master,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 such as, like, these first chinsi,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 first kundra, and all those are there, too.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 They did it that way.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 So I think we've got to look in that way.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 I think that when the shaapai is a very, like,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 already great practitioner,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 great enlightened beings, great masters already,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 at that time, first chinsi,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 first kundra, choyangnungpa,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 all those are just the very young ones, young ones.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And the some great master,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 and the kindipata, everybody also said that, too.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And Para Rama called, you know, Para Rama,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 when he heard the beautiful repetition of the shaapai,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 shaapai, he thought to go to see,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 to receive the teaching from shaapai, thrown out,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 but on the way to the shaapai,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 and the shaapai entered the Mahaparin Rana.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 He said, "So, Mahaparin Rana."

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 So I don't know, physically, Para Rama

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 would be able to meet with the shaapai Rama,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 but however, he heard the beautiful repetition

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 of the realization of the shaapai,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 and he liked to see that, that.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 So that is really about the shaapai Rana.
