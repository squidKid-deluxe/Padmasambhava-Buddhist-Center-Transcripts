00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 Yesterday, many of you already know that, many of you already know that. But again, I'm going to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.000
 talk briefly.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 This is discovered by very famous master, teacher and a scholar in the 20th century.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.040
 From the century, his name was known as Dunyun Jibra Yeshe Dorje. Many times, most of you recall,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 as the Western style, his Holiness Dunyun Rinpoche.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 He was very famous master, famous teacher. He was a teacher of many, many hundred teachers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 He was a great scholar, master, visionary. He discovered these teachings.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 He was determined and he was also predated by the Gaurapayama Sambha.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.250
 In the 8th century, Gaurapayama Sambha predicted the forthcoming of the 20th century, Master Dunyun

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 Jibra.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 Gaurapayama Sambha said, one of his teachings said, "In the future generations, from the center to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.000
 bed is Samye."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Center to bed? 9 Galatia Mountains pass. From east direction of Samye, 9 Galatia Mountains pass.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 There is beautiful location of the secretly hidden land as land of the Vaidya Varahe.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Vaidya Varahe is, many of you already know, whoever you don't know, again, another female Buddha.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 In that, where the birthplace of the book, his own Dunyun Rinpoche is often known as land of the,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.000
 secret land of the Vaidya Varahe, female Buddha.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.730
 In the formation of the land of the Gaurapayama Sambha, when you look, I think, birdwoos of the sky

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.000
, you look to that land formation,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 I think, always in the teachings said, that has the formation of the Vaidya Varahe.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 That's what the teachings said. And of course, no one really looked up, looking down the birdways.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Ourself, I didn't really had the opportunity to do that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.250
 But according to the teaching, the birdwoo, if you look from that above birdwoo, looking down to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.000
 that area,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and that whole land area is the secret land or the formation of the Vaidya Varahe.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.390
 So, Gaurapayama Sambha said, in the future generation passing through 9 Galatia Mountains in east

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 direction of the Vaidya Varahe,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 which is Samye in the center of Tibet, there is beautiful secret location of the Vaidya Varahe.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And there is, the man will come, named with Bustam, or Yishi.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yishi will be born, and who will be born in the claim of the royal claim, royal claim, who was born

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.000
,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 and he will reveal the many Therma, or the hidden teachings that are hidden at the same time,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 then he will continually preserve the ancient existing Therma teachings,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 and reactivate and share them to all the beings.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 That was the pre-adapted by the Gaurapayama Sambha.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And as Gaurapayama Sambha pre-adapted, or said, and his Holiness Dunyurma was born and came,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 and then he did the same thing as the pre-adapted, and revealed.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And this is his revelation teachings, one of his revelation teachings.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 From that teaching, I will offer you the importance.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And now, again, how I received this teaching, and that is directly from him,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 I received, I had the great opportunity to receive many teachings.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.380
 I have one of the very unpleasant, fortunate, and I received quite full of teachings from him

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.000
 directly.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And then, as well as also, I received this teaching from other great teachers, too.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.180
 This teaching, which they received from his Holiness Dunyurma and they also began to share to the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.000
 others,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 so I was also fortunate to receive that teaching from others.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So I received many teachings from many great masters and his Holiness Dunyurma.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.410
 And so, that is, as I received this teaching, and then empowerment, I'm offering you that same

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.000
 spirit to you all.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And that is about lineage, teachings.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Now, I talk very briefly about empowerment, what you said, what means empowerment.
