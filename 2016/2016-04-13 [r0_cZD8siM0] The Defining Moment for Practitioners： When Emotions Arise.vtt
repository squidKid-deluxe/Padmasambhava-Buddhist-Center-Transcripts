00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.120
 "We are good practitioners. We are taking care of the emotions right at the end of the day.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:29.950
 Our self is suffered by these emotions. We are good practitioners. We are taking care of the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.360
 emotions right at the end of the day."

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.150
 Many great masters in practicing always say that the defining moment of the practitioner is when

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.720
 emotions arise.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.960
 When the emotions arise, the practitioner handles so nicely that right there, we do not disturb one

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.920
's own self.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.450
 We do not disturb the others. If they take care of that right there, then that is really a good

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.080
 sign of the achievement of the practices.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.720
 That is the picture, the best sign in the teaching field. That is true practitioners, then you are

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.280
 really practicing.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.480
 That is how we can tell how we are going to handle our emotions.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.280
 Every emotion arises, we are carried by the force of that emotion.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.660
 As we did so many times or as we did before our practices, then our practice is not really

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.440
 developing strongly, not going strong.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:44.880
 For that reason, again, rest in the body together. Rest in your meditation practices again.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 These emotions are always in the teachings. They are like, as I said, the defining moment or they

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.520
 are thermometers of the practitioners.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.400
 So we can judge or we can tell to ourselves, we don't have to ask someone, "How are my practices

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.600
 doing?"

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.720
 We can measure with the thermometers of this, this.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 And if we are able to handle that so nicely, what is happening to us?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.720
 Then his great Master Chakra said here too, Chakra Chaturana said already, "We are developing,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.680
 strengthening our vastness."

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.240
 All those five vastness are really expressed for those reasons, many times in the practice lineages

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.800
 in the teaching, in my teaching said,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.320
 "As much as emotions, that much power of the vastness," also said, "that means that you can handle

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.360
 that so nicely,"

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.240
 then that emotion becomes the visitors.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:05.040
 So as much as our emotions, that much big, our wisdom is growing, much more power, strength is

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.560
 developing.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.560
 But then if we couldn't handle that, then it would cross us, cross us, undermine,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:22.190
 and we would fall again in the porthole of the emotions and fell down on that hole, ditches, and we

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.240
 fell down on the ditch.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:36.640
 So therefore this emotion, that's how the great Master said how to take care of the emotions.
