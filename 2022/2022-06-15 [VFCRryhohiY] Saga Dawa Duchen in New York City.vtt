00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780
 "Trogeta" I thought to do because today, as we all know, it's a very special day according

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:17.920
 to the Buddhism. It is the day Buddha actually performed so many beneficial activities in

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.080
 his life to benefit for all living beings without any discrimination, without any partialities

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:36.000
 through his love, compassion, wisdom, and ability that he helped. Among those all the activities

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 summarized by the great master Maitrya, Maitrya, the future upcoming Buddha Maitrya, summarized

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 into 12 deeds, which is a very high line of activities that Buddha did, 12 activities.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.840
 Among that 12 activities, this month, according to the great Buddhism, happened, happened

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.760
 among the 12, about five of them. Really, this month happened. That means this month

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.960
 happened just, I mean, before this, two weeks, within a two-week period, that all, what I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:27.640
 say, among six major, 12 major activities, Buddha, that five of them, I think it happened

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 in this month, in within this two weeks, those are the first one is the birth, birth date.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.960
 The Buddha's enlightenment, Buddha, born in, according to Vedic calendar, which is on the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 seventh day of the lunar calendar of the fourth month of the Sagatavas. Then, and now, final one,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.920
 is enlightenment, and then Mahaparin Narayana. But among that true Mahaparin Narayana and his

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.600
 enlightenment, again, great master and the future Buddha Maitrya, I mean, in Vedic, this is not

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.920
 just

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.520
 the only matter, he said, but it's very known to everyone. And one of the activities is known as

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.800
 walking toward the Bodhi tree. The Buddha walked toward Bodhi tree before he got enlightenment,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.960
 that I'm, so he walked to the Bodhi tree with courage, with commitment, with confidence, with

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.120
 the determination. What a determination of courage and commitment, he said, I'm going to, I'm going

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.560
 to propel and achieve my final goal of the accumulated, the married, the Puertoican-less eons,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm going to achieve, going to propel that goal, right on this, so that with that great commitment,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.520
 with that commitment, vision, commitment, courage. And then he walked toward the Bodhi tree, and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520
 then

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.920
 there's many teachings on that. But I walked and said, lay out beautiful kusha grass that he

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.640
 received from the young boy, known as grass-cell rashi, mangalam boy received. And like I said,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.800
 it's beautiful, like green, like as feathers from the from the peacock on the neck, so beautiful,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.120
 that he lay out so evenly under the Bodhi tree. And then he sat down, facing to the east, then he

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.400
 said,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 I'm never going to move from this seat without obtaining my enlightenment. Whether my bone is

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:02.520
 cracking, my bone is dried up by the heat, oil is cracking, no matter what he was saying, I'm never

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.120
 going to move from this cushion without obtaining the fulfillment and the goal of the enlightenment

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.120
,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.160
 or the goal of the three countless eons, accumulated married, versus married, I'm going to achieve.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.440
 And

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:26.280
 with that commitment, he sat down, sitting on that radial, close radial leg, facing to the east. So

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.880
 that is known as one of the really, his major activities. Because his courage, his commitment,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.560
 his determination, his vision, he came with that commitment, but I walked on to that. And the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.960
 second

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.960
 activity, the next activity is to resume with all the Mahārās. Right after that, there's

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.720
 according

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.770
 to Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, you know that. There's so many disturbances that happened, external,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 and all the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.240
 Mahārās and obstacles started coming, trying to do, deduct him in the popular object ways. So

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.560
 many

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.960
 ways, trying to, trying to interfer his realization and achievement. But the mother never moved,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.600
 never

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.840
 shake. That never did. Everything is subdued by his radial leg samadhi, as well as his lowing kind,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.920
 his compared to meditation. All that's subdued, right there. That is known as the activity of the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.720
 concurring of the all the Mahārās. Then in the morning, at the early of the dawn of the morning,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 morning, and then he reached enlightenment. Of course, that is a great activity, enlightenment

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:50.200
 activities. He reached enlightenment. So today, major activities all happened these days. I move

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.960
 this, related with enlightenment. And then at 81 or 82 or 88, depending with the different

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.280
 knowledge systems, then he entered Mahārās in the run at the same time. Same date. So therefore,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.360
 this date is considered, or this month is considered, into very calendar, multiple month,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.840
 as you all know. And that's where we all went to practice, restore our courage and commitment,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.440
 and inspiration, and determination, and joyful effort with dharma, and to live for the beautiful

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.270
 goal. We all are followers of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shātamuni, and Gaurabha Masambhava, so

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.440
 wish

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.880
 their blessings, and their power, and love, and compassion, and courage, and commitment. Also,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.960
 really receive us, so we will be rewarded with courage, and very strong, and stand, and fearless

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.800
 to achieve the goal of enlightenment, to defeat it, or to remove all the ego clingings and the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:56.120
 negative ideas. And this is according to Buddhism, it is very big goal. And to follow this, we need

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.920
 courage and commitment to goal, because there are so many interpretations of this, to achieve that

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:11.640
 goal. And so, we need steady, fast commitment, and goal, and the vision, and the determination,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:18.400
 combined with the joyful effort, with then bodhicata, rafuja, those vowels, all that. So that's

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.640
 what

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.130
 really we taught to do this ceremony, and practice, we all restore our, this connection to the dh

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.320
arma.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:33.880
 And so, we do, therefore we taught, I taught to do this rafuja, renewing the rafuja, practices of

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.160
 vowels,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.040
 and then along with the bodhicata. And now, in order to do that, of course, I think you all know,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:46.000
 we're going to join this instruction of the here. In this text, actually it has also, of course,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.280
 this is the known highlight of the bodhicata vowels. But, when we take the bodhicata vowels,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.280
 always we need to take rafuja too. Rafuja is a foundation of all the Buddha teachings, doesn't

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.880
 matter, whatever schools we belong, or the, whether we are in the first Buddhist schools,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.400
 or Buddhist foundation schools, or Mahayana, Sotr Mahayana, Vaidhayana, Mahayana, or any

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.840
 or in a tantra, out of that practice, rafuja is foundation. And along with that, bodhicata is so

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:25.320
 important. So therefore, here is rafuja, and I thought we do it together here, together. But,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.480
 you know, to strengthen our intention, that correct our motivation and intention, again,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.280
 joy and appreciation, and then also feel strong connection to the Buddha, and bodhisattvas, all

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.680
 the enlightenment beings, all Buddha dharmasangas. It feels strongly. This is one of the beautiful

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:51.240
 moment in our life. We're restoring, strengthening our connection to Buddha, Buddha dharmasanga,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:59.360
 all our practices, and bodhicata, how wonderful. We also combine that attitude with the bodhicata,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.920
 what are we doing tonight, made that benefit of all living beings to the enlightenment, really

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.080
 which

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.280
 is sincerely, and then as well as also made benefit of brain to the peace, harmony, and really

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.770
 understanding to each other. So there is no more wars, no more disasters, no more earthquakes, no

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:19.160
 more,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.720
 my any bad things, disease, really which sincerely from the heart, and that which is known as then

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.840
 practice on bodhisattva, bodhicata practices too. So therefore all those beautiful tools of our

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840
 mental,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.600
 that rich qualities, and brain thought, and then we do this practice. First we feel strong presence

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.600
 of bodhakshatyam, right in front of our sky. Buddha is sitting on the lines turn, lot of sun and

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:45.800
 moon,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:53.040
 sitting with the radial postures, and then we all know Buddha is so calm, peaceful, and soothing,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:01.520
 calming, and golden radiating, golden light to all of us, and then sitting and looking to us with,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.670
 right in front of us, and the Buddha is surrounded by such as Gharip and Masamur, Bodhisattva, Tar

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.040
am,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.160
 and all the bodhisattva, every enlightened beings, and Arhatas, all are here, everyone in front of

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:23.000
 that we may own, all kind of offerings, all, every offering exists, the existing offering, mental

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.150
 offerings on every, really with full of devotion, joy, impaired, and confident, and just pure

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.520
 presence,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.720
 and then we renew bodhicata, rahudu vows, and as well as bodhicata vows, but also I was kind

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.430
 of reminded each time that we just treat things, so we do that, and I just told you talk about that

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440
,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:52.380
 really about that, and now we begin these practices, if you have this copy, so please open your

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.080
 booklet,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:01.920
 if you don't have that, then maybe you can share that too, so now we've moved to the page one.
