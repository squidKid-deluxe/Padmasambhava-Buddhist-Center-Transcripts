00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 A qualified teacher, they are qualified students. It goes both ways. A qualified teacher, qualified

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.000
 students.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.690
 But all the teachers, in the teaching always, therefore all the teachers that you received, what do

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 you know about all the teachers?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 From whom you received the teachings? We are going to see that in the form of Gaurupenmasu.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 All Amitabha, all that teaching, we know that this and that this and this, all teachers are in one

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.000
 central state as Buddha Amitabha or the Gaurupenmasu.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And they receive, and they do the practice, such as Murugo.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.640
 And the devotion is yet another. I said many times, you know, you read many times books and all

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 that, and it's true.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 Devotion, again, the Gaurupenmasu Sarah said, realization of the true nature of the world in born,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 in born realization of the true nature of the world, comes only two methods.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.710
 There are no any other methods. One is accumulating the merit, doing good deeds, good deeds by body

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.000
, speech, speech and mind, and other is devotion.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Combine together, together well in born, bring the birth of the realization.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.260
 Because why is not going to happen? Because if we are not, not if we don't have the devotion, it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.000
 becomes intellectual, intellectual.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It becomes skeptical. In a way, deep down there is a condensation of the skeptical.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 And there is also deep down there is untrusters. Deep down there is doubt and hesitations.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Doubt and hesitations never going to let reveal our inner duties.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Therefore, this great Sarah, I said, see, this true, there is no any other methods.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.480
 When you have this true, how that realization will come, it will come up as you find the treasure

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.000
 from your own palms, palm leaves.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 It will come up. This you can, we can read, all those great masters, masters.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.360
 And I will suggest a narrow pass, and then great master, Veroja Janas. Great master, Shiri Sinhas.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.000
 Great master, Mejuchiri Muthalini Dzoki.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.820
 You read a large screen of those. How they contract, how they find those teachers, and how they

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.000
 become as our lineage masters, lineage teachers.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 Even Guru Pemma, some of them are known as the emanation of the Buddha Amitabha, direct emanation

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000
 of the Buddha Amitabha, reincarnation of the Buddha Chakra Muni.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 But his journey played that role when he went to contract with those great masters.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 He become a student, a student, and contract with them, with love, devotion, respect.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Respect, and receive the teachings. All that teaching were mentioned.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And Vammana Mathras, Janasukras. And then as well, I say the Gunjipas, great omniscient Gunjipas.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The world is known as the second God of Durga. Read in the books.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 It's not just that he meditated against only on the sky, sky and that's it.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 He did practice accumulations. He started, he contemplated, he meditated, he practiced.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 He contracted to his great teacher, Gomaratha, over six years, or twelve years, I think.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.110
 He contracted. For that reason, in teaching, the student must contract the teacher, and we like to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.000
 receive the teaching.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Quite long. And the teacher must also guide them quite wide.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Why? Why? So therefore there is no misunderstanding of the realization, practice, welcome.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 He said, practice, that with devotion and joy and appreciations.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 And then, for example, there is another great masters.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Masters are known as, like in the Dzubti teaching, what is known as?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Mind section lineage, space section lineage, and pit instructing lineage.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.980
 One of the very famous master, first masters or the lineage, holder of this space section lineage

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.000
 was Paine Mahangong.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Pongin Mahangong.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 He was very old, old, when he met Verojana in the teaching set.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 He was old, some days old, 90 years old, sometimes even almost 100 years old in history.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 But anyway, he is very old. However, he has an unfailing devotion.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Even he didn't meet Verojana by hearing the name of the Verojana.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And then he thought always, how I can meet this great teacher.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Teacher, Verojana went far east to Tibet that time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 And he heard one day, Verojana is returning from far east to Tibet.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 He went back to the center of Tibet. He waited on the road.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 In the road, he waited when Verojana as their passage is wet.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And he asked them when he met, he asked the teachers,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 "Verojana be simple instruction of the Dzugti."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Dzugti, but it was his devotion.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 His devotion and concentrate, he felt the richness of the teaching.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 He put that into the practices as he received.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 He became transcendent of Verojana.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 I mean, he reached 10 rainbow borders.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 This is the renown.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Also, by devotion, even his that age, the old,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 even he can't see in the teaching, he can't see very well.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And he also can't see that very well.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Straight up, what's called this, the posture, lion's posture.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 The 7th posture, the Buddha Verojana.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 He Verojana put special strength that can hold up his chin.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 When you see the lion's arms of hand,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 you will see there is some stress hold.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And Verojana put meditation rope to put around his knee

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 so that he can hold up.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 They have to use that as techniques.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Techniques, he managed to reach the enlightenment.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And then you are going to look this way.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 For example, Maha Revas.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 His delegation, his courage, his commitment,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 his devotion, his inspiration is uncheckable.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 We went to the Maha.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Otherwise, we knew the light strength of Maha Revas.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 How much he holds had difficulties, troubles, and challenges.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Sometimes, maybe you think, "Oh, this great teacher, Maha B,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 almost kind of led me to him."

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 You can think that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Oh, he is not fair.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 He is abusing his problems.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 All those words we can use.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 But he never squishes that.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 He never thought.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 He is always back to the seat, back to the place,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 until he got what he wanted.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 And because his courage and his devotion,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 his joy, and then Maha gave everything to him.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 That is what treasure he has.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And then Maha Revas preserved that teaching.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Not just he got left.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 He preserved that.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 That, in practice, that putting practice,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 he went all those, he said, castles.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 He went so many castles.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 He stayed many different castles.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Those castles, the caves, he used castles.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 In those castles, he practiced exactly that.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 What Maha taught.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Then Maha Revas become the great Malarepa, the warriors.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And one time, his students said, because in their lives,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 "Oh, great Maha Revas, you must be emanation of someone,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 such this realization you got.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 God, you must be emanation of the Buddha

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 or some great bodhisattvas."

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Maha Revas said, he said, "Well, that's very kind of you saying to me,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 but this is the most, you also, this is one of the worst,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 blame or criticize to the teaching, that is."

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 To criticize.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 That means you're not trusting.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Trusting to other teachers.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 "It's not that," he said.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 "I trust the teaching.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 I practice the teaching as I learned.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Then I got this, what result do you think that I got?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Because of my work, of these lives, I got.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 It's not something that I've gone, come with this," he said.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 See it.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 These all tell us.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And then, for example, Master Bhaparudwaj, Master Yiminagwa,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Yiminagwa, and their devotion, their joy and appreciation.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And then great teacher, his only donor will always say that.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Whatever comes to trouble, difficulty during practices,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 whether we have troubles of the scared mind,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 whether we have troubles of the sinking mind,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 whether we have troubles of the rough regions,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 whether we're having smooth regions,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 the one medicine that cures every, every troubles

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 and fix that on a straight out, is devotion.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 That's what great Master, teacher, his only donor will say.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 So therefore, I mean, this is the one voice,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 because it's all that great Master says.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 And when you look at the nature of devotion,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 it's the confidence, joy, and appreciation.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Appreciate it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 That has to be embracing our richness and glorify.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So those are all the teachings.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Of course, you heard this.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 I heard this too.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 But in a way, I'm reversing this to yourself, to myself,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 so that we can all continue to stay on the track,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.560
 in the truck, on the truck, and then here.
