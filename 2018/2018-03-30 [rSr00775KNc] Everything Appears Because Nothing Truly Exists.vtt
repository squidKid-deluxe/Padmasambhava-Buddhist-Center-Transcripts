00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.550
 It's all in existence. All is in this magnificent place. Everything is displayed from the

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.000
 translucent and perceived by the power of the awareness.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And awareness and emptiness are never separated from this. There is nothing in existence.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And when you relax, how are we going to discover this?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 We are going to discover that by relaxing meditating on the natures, not by the analyzations.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 When we are trying to analyze this nature, there is nothing really to find.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 This is like reflecting more in the water.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 There is all, all is preformed, preformed, caused and resolved in the identities. Everything is pre

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.000
formed, caused and resolved in the identities of the natures.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.400
 And we look there, of course, everything is there still, but we kind of look to the point of our

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 own mind to maybe assemble it there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 For example, present our mind, where is it coming from?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Now we ask the question to ourselves, where is our mind coming from?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.490
 What answer we have? There are no answers. That is known as preformed, caused, and there is no

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 cause that we can see.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Where our mind is going to go, or going?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Again you ask that question, and you look where is mind going?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 There is nothing we can see. And that is simply known as result is preformed, empty, or preformed.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Result is empty. There is nothing to be formed. And then, where is mind now?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 If we look, think, think. Again there is nothing, no answer. That is called nature is empty.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 So, cause is empty, result is empty, and nature is empty.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.470
 This is how we own this. This is not going to matter, nothing is going to matter, nothing we can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.000
 see.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 It is not going to matter.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.040
 Again, I told you, because of the emptiness of this nature's openness, there are all these things

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 arising.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Things are existing, things are emerging, coming up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 All this just flexible quality of things are happening because of the emptiness.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 There is no emptiness, it is solid.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Things are not going to happen as is happening.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 The solitude will block everything.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 A great Master Mohanam Gautam in the Kṛṣṇī Bhānī Kṛṣṇu, he took many times for days.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Even his Mohanam Gautam says, "There is even one tiny, small atom is existing as solid."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 If the rest is just like not solid, one atom is solid.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 That one atom will block the whole system.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It will create big, tougher games.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Now everything is moving, everything is shifting, everything starts forming.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 That's both subject level, object level, all is like big movements happening.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 But if one atom exists, solid, concretely exists in a permanent land,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 it will block the whole system.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And we cannot move, we cannot breathe, we cannot think.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Everything becomes acid. What's called? Zombie.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Then it's zombie. Do we want to be zombie?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 No, of course. No way of hosing, no way of hosing.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 That's the one we really sold.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Therefore, great Master Mohanam Gautam has said, "How wonderful, this openness,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 this freedom, vastness."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Therefore, we also deluded, but now we can also go back to that nature.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Everything is solid, we cannot do anything.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Completely stuck.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And then, next one, the nature of the emptiness is how luminously those are immaculately.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And then also nature is already, nature of the mind is three guys status.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Three guys status. It's dharmakaya, sambhokaya, namakaya status.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful. When you realize this nature,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 then it is for that reason how amazing that is the nature of the mind.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 The nature of the mind.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And then we move to the next page, page seventy.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Page seventy.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And everything is emptiness, but that's going to help.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 That is not really going to help, yet it is dharmakaya.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And if you think of all this, the emptiness, not the emptiness of all nature,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 that's also not going to help.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 For those reasons, relaxing on the nature stage as it is.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 When realization grows, when the development comes,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 what is the capability of all the individuals, according to their capabilities?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Gradually, instantly, then the wisdom that goes beyond the conceptual world belongs.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Individually, the primordial wisdom beyond the conceptual world begins to succeed.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 So, up to that is really about the meditation.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Now, as I said, indirectly, now what we can?
