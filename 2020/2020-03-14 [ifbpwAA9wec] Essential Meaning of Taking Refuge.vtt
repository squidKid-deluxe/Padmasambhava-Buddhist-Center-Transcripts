00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.820
 In the three jewels, which are the essence of any tree root, in the bodhijana, which is the true

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 nature of the channels, winds, and essence,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 and in the medulla of the essence, nature, compassion, then I take refuge until attaining the heart

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000
 of enlightenment.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.440
 So that is bodhijana. This is the famous teaching of the devil of the great master of human-master

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.000
 jimin.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.490
 That's the inner teaching. So here, what is kind of trying to bring up this little more, because it

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.980
 has more than three jewels, bodhijana-santham.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 So what is the inner teaching of the great master? After refuge, inner refuge, singular refuge, and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980
 absolute refuge.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.220
 So taking refuge in external level, taking refuge in inner level, and taking refuge in singular

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.980
 level, and taking refuge in absolute levels.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.370
 Those are the four different ways of taking refuge. The essence of refuge, of course, is the same

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.980
 that you all know.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:37.020
 No, refuge means making close connection to the bodhijana-santham or to the object-buddha-santham,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.980
 close connection.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:52.030
 That close connection is how that is, with confidence, with devotion, or with unfailing confidence,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 with joy, making connection.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:04.190
 Not just contraction, but unfailing confidence. That is known as the essence of refuge, close

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.980
 connection, making close.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:21.030
 So that means, in every spoke kind of simple way, that trusty, really joy, unfailing, trusty, and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.980
 enjoy. That is the leverage, common essence.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 How are we going to keep that until we become the bodhijana? That means that until we discover our

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.980
 innate nature.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 Or our God completely discovered itself until death. Then why we don't need upper death?

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.980
 In the teaching, you say that you don't have to take refuge in the notion of that attitude, because

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 you yourself become the ultimate of the refuge.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 You attend that goal. So therefore, that is not something that you have to do externally.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:15.980
 But until that, keep commitment, keep trusting, and with joy, embracing that.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.970
 Whatever the situation and circumstance we go through, our trusty, confidence, joy is not failing

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.980
 with you.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 Always in the heart center, until eternity. That is really known as refuge.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.980
 Now that refuge we are taking to externally, and here, see, the three jewels.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 This is externally, generally, it's every Buddhism, Chhagravata.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:56.980
 There is no difference between Theravada or Sarva Istvata schools, or all the Mahayana, and Vedaya.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.310
 Everyone falls over to Chhagravata. That's just standard, that therefore, God holds us out, using

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.980
 terminology, as out, and be generous.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.980
 Now inner refuge is a difference. They don't use this terminology, such as Theravada, all that.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.980
 Then, from an inner refuge, then it's different. So inner refuge is what?

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:30.460
 Guru, Deva, Dakini, as I said. That's a three root. Three root is in Sanskrit, Guru, Deva, and Dak

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.980
ini.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.980
 In that way, it says, Lama, Yadav, Kannur, Lama, Yadav, Kannur. That is.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:48.980
 So this is now inner refuge. That means particularly Vedayana practices, terminology, use it.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.980
 So now, what that means, we are giving either Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:02.760
 No. Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are become as Guru, Deva, Dakini, terminology used as Guru, Deva,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.980
 Dakini.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.980
 And so, it is not at all. And what means three root?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:19.590
 It means the root of blessing is Guru's. Root of blessings, sorry, root of accomplishment is Yadav,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.980
 or jinnis.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.980
 And root of the activity, the following activity is Dakini and Dharma, as I said.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.980
 And then every say, say, how we can connect that to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:44.980
 The Guru is Buddha, the deity is Dharma, and the Dakini and Dharma are as Sangha.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 So that's the general understanding.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.980
 So that means, the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are also within the three root.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 Guru, Deva, Dakini.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.980
 And Guru have you example to example, who is Guru?

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.980
 Guru can be, for example, Guru Pemma Sangha.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.980
 Guru Pemma Sangha by embodiment of all the brothers and the Dharma and Sangha.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.980
 Then according to the devotion that you have and the confidence that you have,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.980
 each individual teacher also can be perceived as Guru.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.980
 Guru, that depends upon the individual's confidence.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.980
 For those reasons, many times in the teaching said, because of our confidence,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.980
 even the human teacher, you can be as part of Guru Pemma Sangha.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 So we always like Guru Pemma Sangha, Guru Pemma Sangha as our teacher.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.980
 Teaching, that is what Buddha is, Guru Pemma Sangha Buddha.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.980
 And the Yadaams, what is the Yadaams? For example, the Yadaams have been said,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.980
 that example of the Vedic Goliath is the Yadaam.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.980
 Vedic Satva is the Yadaam.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.980
 And of course, this that means, they really mean they are not Dharma,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.980
 but it's only highlighted.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.980
 So, and then the Swatyasa Amitabha can be Yadaam too.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.980
 Now for the D.T., I'm translate it. Or Yadaam, D.T., and then Devas are all,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.980
 there's some terminology said there.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.980
 So, they are.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.980
 And then, what is Dakinis?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 Dakinis suggest Dakini Shithonas.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.980
 Where are your meanings? Where are your Taras?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 And as well, all those are named as like Dakinis.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.980
 Again, it really means they are not Dharma, they are not Yadaams.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.980
 They are Yadaam, they are D.T., but it's only highlighted all of us.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.980
 So, that is what is known as Guru Deva Dakinis.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.980
 That is inner Dafuji.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.980
 And the severe Dafuji is, now, is, now here he said what?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:08.980
 Severe Dafuji is the Bodhic Dada, which is true nature of channel, wind, and essence.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:16.980
 Severe Dafuji is channel, wind, and essence element,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.980
 which is the resident of the Bodhic Dada.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.980
 And why translate that?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:29.980
 Wind is the resident of the Bodhic Dada, which is residing within the channel,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:38.980
 within the wind, within the essence element of the Bodhic.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.980
 That is simply reference.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:49.980
 Why this channel and wind and essence element become as object reference?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.980
 According to Vediyana, as we mentioned earlier, we are studying, right?

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.980
 Vediyana, this Bodhi is not a regular Bodhi.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.980
 It's not a insignificant thing.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 This Bodhi is very precious.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.980
 Therefore, Manetran's teaching said, "Oh, this Bodhi is a temple.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.980
 A temple of all the Buddhas.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:22.980
 This is simple, so simple, and it's a temple.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.980
 All the pieces of Buddhas, rather Buddhas, those are highlighted there.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.980
 But the murmur of Buddhas are residing.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.980
 Where they're residing, they're residing in the channels.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980
 They're residing in the wind.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.980
 They're residing in the essence element of the Bodhi.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.980
 The essence element Bodhi is that we obtain from the gross essence element of the Bodhi,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.980
 we receive from our parent, white element and red element.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.980
 They're called teaching.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:58.980
 There's a subtle essence element that comes with our conscience, indestructible,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:07.980
 even sometimes indestructible spirit, spirit that moves from life to life, life.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:15.980
 And where the essence is, it's residing all over the channel, all over the wind,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:23.980
 as the oil is spread out with the mustard seed.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.980
 Mustard seed is oil.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
 Oil of the mustard seed is spread out throughout the mustard seed.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.980
 It's not just one location.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.980
 All the oil of the nut, it's not just one location of nut,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.980
 it's spread out, even spread out.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:57.980
 Similarly, this essence element is spread out all our bodies with channel, with wind, with essence.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:09.980
 And so, therefore, these channels, our channels are like we use as figures, it's dakinis.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:23.980
 And we say what are the channels, are the essence of the dakini, dakini and the narmakayas.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:30.980
 And the winds are the essence of the dharmon and as well as the duties.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:39.980
 And the essence element is the essence of the gurus and the dharmon kayas.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.980
 So the other level is three kayas.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:52.370
 And all the absolute Buddha, Dharma, Sangha and Guru Deva dakinis is residing in a bearded form of

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.980
 channel, wind, essence.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:04.520
 And we connect to these three principles and use that, that these existing channels and essence

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.980
 elements and wind are currently existing things with our body.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.980
 That's what we are like.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.980
 All right.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.980
 And we use those techniques as very analytical.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:25.010
 Then we can roughly advance our realization or the discovery of our inner nature or the enlightened

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.980
 nature.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.980
 Then here I say this, in the Bodhic Chakra.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.980
 So Bodhic Chakra is what?

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.980
 Bodhic Chakra is an absolute Bodhic Chakra.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.980
 Absolute Bodhic Chakra and that is terminology can be used as dakakan and dharma.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:50.360
 Buddha nature, Buddha nature or the salt bone, enlightened salt bone, awareness of the primordial

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.980
 wisdom.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:59.980
 Wisdom, that which is hiding within the channel, within the wind, within the essence element.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:12.740
 That is the significant object of refuge. To recognize that and be, by that said, activate those

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.980
 with teaching, then we are explorations of our inner culture.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.980
 That is what is known as the significant object of refuge.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:28.470
 Then the absolute object of refuge is what here, here is it, and in the mind of the essence, nature

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.980
 and compassion.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.980
 That is within our Rupa.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.980
 Rupa, our awareness is embodiment of the three guides.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:45.980
 Our Rupa is embodiment of essence, compassion and the nature.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.980
 And how that Dr. T.J. said, many of you know, that nature is emptiness.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:14:02.980
 Essence is clarity, luminous cities, and then radiating energy is compassion.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:10.980
 Rupa, our awareness is not just a block of physical object, kind of state, it is radiating.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.980
 Where is radiating? In a larger level, it is radiating to all the beings.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.980
 Every six realms, it is radiating our own awareness.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.980
 That is a larger level, it is true, according to the teaching.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.980
 And more kind of an excluding level is radiating to every of our senses.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.980
 That is what we know, that is not what we feel, we smell, we taste, we feel.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 All that radiating energy, that collective of that event is brightening up.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.980
 This is the luminous city, more luminous feet than the sun and moon, or the stars.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:53.980
 Luminous, call it, that is what essence is.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.980
 Essence is luminous city, it is radiating.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.980
 And then that radiating is not just a kind of self-importance, a sense of love, or we know it.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.980
 It is compassion, it is kindness.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
 It is providing to every dimension, that compassion love.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:20.980
 And that which is also known as dharmakaya, sambhokaya, and dharmakayas.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.980
 Nature is dharmakaya, essence is dharmakaya, and compassion is dharmakaya.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.980
 This is absolute rub, technique of the raffa.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.980
 Recognize that nature and be in that status.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.980
 It is technique of raffa.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.980
 That is abiding the dharmakaya status, technique of raffa.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.980
 And how long are we going to do that?

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.980
 Until we become the Buddha.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:51.980
 We are here saying, I tell raffa, until I attain the heart of enlightenment.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.980
 Until that.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.980
 So that is the meaning, the essential meaning of this technique of raffa.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.980
 And again, externally feel strong presence of all those of you who raffa is

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.980
 an army lover and a lineage master.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.980
 As in purgatory we went on many times, again, I believe in people.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.980
 Sibling, devotion, sizzling, trusting, confidence, and joy with that.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:20.980
 And then with important hand toward the heart center and guide this prayer three times.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.980
 Time with those understanding.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.980
 Don't ever think every time of this and that, this and that thing.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:31.980
 But now if you don't have meaning, then just be in that status and enjoy this prayer.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.980
 And that is technique, raffa, raffa.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.980
 And then, next one is...
