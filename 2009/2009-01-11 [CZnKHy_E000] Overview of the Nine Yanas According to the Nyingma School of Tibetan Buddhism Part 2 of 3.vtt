 Center on April 8, 2008.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.610
 And again, this is the creation stage or the visualization stage that is generally mainly

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 explaining or the teaching that emphasizing all this visualization or the creation stage.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.960
 That means to bring the vividly natural of this appearing aspect of the nature, kind of mainly that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.000
 explaining that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.790
 So appearing, all this appearing or the perceptions, the conceptions, all this is originally

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.000
 enlightened state.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.240
 And to see that as it is, explaining that mainly this focus therefore is known as the creation

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.000
 stages.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 It doesn't mean that it don't have the complete stages.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 It doesn't mean it has the great complete stage, such as the Zokki teachings.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 But it is only just mainly focus, focus that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.110
 And then such as the completion stages of Anu Yova teaching, it also means there is two different

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.000
 complete stages as you know.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 The characterized complete stages and then non-characterized complete stages.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.170
 Or the completion stages could be characterized that mainly deals with the visual or physical

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.600
 structure of the inner in kind of system of the natures with things like the channels, the winds,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.000
 and as well as their movement.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.710
 And that is as kind of the nature explaining exactly as it is revealing that it is authentic nature

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.000
, natural.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.540
 And that which explaining very thoroughly, dutifully, and that is known as the completion stage of

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.000
 the characterized.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.030
 And then complete stage without characterized is beyond the consumption, beyond the mind as Zokki

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.000
 teachings.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.970
 So this Anu Yova teaching also does not mean that I don't have any visualization or the teachings

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.000
 of the Anu Mahayoga teachings as well as the Ati Yova teachings.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.320
 It has all that but it more that we are more focused on the teachings of the, specifically the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.000
 inner structure of the regular body and to revealing it is innate nature as it is.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.110
 And then Zokki teaching which is the same day teaching, same day teaching also contains the Mahay

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.000
oga teaching and as well as Anu Yova teaching.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.130
 But the Zokki teaching more focused than the self-born awareness wisdom or the self-born primordial

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.000
 wisdom.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.270
 That is more kind of focused on that and then all others are coming on this as a side, part of the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.000
 side.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.770
 Therefore, then Zokki is often known as the Jhana, that which is beyond the mind because the self-

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.710
born primordial wisdom is the ordinary nature that which is beyond the conception, beyond the dual

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.000
ity, beyond any kind of idea and thought.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 For that reason, then this is often said that is not really the Jhana, it is the Buddhahood.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.260
 It is the old universal state. So therefore, often it is beyond the Jhana, beyond any character

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.000
 states. That is what is said.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.180
 But however, it also doesn't mean that all other teachings are not contained within the Zokki

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.000
 teaching.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 All the teachings are there and that is generally not just only three.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.970
 There are two inner Tantra, such as Mahayoga, Anu Yoga, but the Zokki teaching contains all other J

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.330
hana teachings that start from the Hinayana or such as Kya Rokayana, Pathik Bodhayana and Bodhisatt

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.000
va Yanas and as well as the outer Tantra, such as Kriya or Bhaayoga.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.700
 So, all those Tantra kind of emerges, fills, then the ultimate state of true nature because all

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.000
 those teachings are the teachings of the true nature,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 teachings that will discover this inner nature and bring the Buddhahood.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.400
 Therefore, the direction and the system and the nature that all teaching agree to the one single

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.000
 state which is beyond the duality, beyond the conception,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.850
 beyond any conception or the emotion, that is the teaching agree and therefore, Zokki teaching is

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.000
 the ultimate teaching.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Therefore, all teaching falls within this single state.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.860
 ♪ So let's do what I do ♪
