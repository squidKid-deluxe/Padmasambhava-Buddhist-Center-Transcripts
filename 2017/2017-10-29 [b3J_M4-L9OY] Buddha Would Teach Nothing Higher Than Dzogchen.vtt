00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 As well as also bring more devotions to it. And we are really connecting to one of the beautiful

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.000
 teachings.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 According to Buddha teaching, according to Gurbel Masambhava and everyone,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 there is nothing higher and deeper and more than the teaching to discover our inner nature.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 There is nothing else. No words beyond Dzogchen teaching.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Even if we met Buddha somewhat by the right hand or Gurbel Masambhava met the right hand,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 they will say there is nothing more than this Dzogchen teaching.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.290
 That's what every teaching says. Nothing higher, deeper, profound, dearer, more simple teaching

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.000
 than the Dzogchen teachings.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And to compare with all Dzogchen teachings, when we look into the Dzogchen teaching,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 to compare with other teachings, all Dzogchen, all other teachings are conceptual teachings.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Teachings on the conceptual, how to dispel by the conceptual to conceptual.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Dzogchen is the teaching, lead instant into beyond the conceptual.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's therefore, it is in it, in nature, primordial wisdom Dzogchen teachings.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Today we are going to touch to that nature as the voice of the great masters, the lineage masters.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 They are not just intellectuals talking these teachings, considering their practices.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 They merited it, they actualized it, they got the realization.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 They prefer their goal. Truly they are.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Therefore, when you read their life stories, how much they are humble, simple, drawn to the earth.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 How much they are humane, really simple, humane.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 But yeah, full of love, full of compassion, full of respect, respect, the appreciations,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 and full with both each other.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Not just intellectually, kind of like talking back and forth and this and that things, really.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Observe completely that this thing is discovered in it, nature, exile as it is.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 This Dzogchen teaching is reconnected to that very nature.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And how did they reconnect to that?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 With the devotions, with confidence, and with both each other.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Follow the exile examples of those great teachings.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 As God had taught, as God had remembered, as God had achieved, all those great masters taught.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 So therefore, if we listen and we appreciate it, it is so important.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And when we have that, we are kind of more settling our own beautiful nature.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Not carried by the intellectual area and all these things.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Really, doing observant teaching.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 In the new art teacher, always said a great master, K.T. Pardis, you know, making many times,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 studying and practicing cooperating, not just a kind of like two separate things.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 As we learn, we practice.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 As we practice, we explore.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 That's what we hope that it's not just something, it's two separate, government, department,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 all combined, and from it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So as we follow these Dzogchen teachings,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 also that we all practice Dzogchen.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 We listen to our understanding, we listen to our realization, our meaning of Dzogchen teaching.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 One after another, and kind of really set our own beautiful nature.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And so those are the kind of what we have, we were told, and then...
