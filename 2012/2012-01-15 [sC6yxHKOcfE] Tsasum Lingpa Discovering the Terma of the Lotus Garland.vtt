00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 Then after that, Tsasum Lingpa, who was renowned as the emanation of the again Sangeesu, who came

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.680
 at around 17 centuries.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:23.620
 According to Kannada, when we are trying to find out exactly when he came, Tsasum Lingpa came

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.900
 around toward the end of 17th century.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:37.840
 16th century. No, 17th century. Yeah, and toward the end of the 16th century, we go to around 1684

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.580
 or around that time.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.020
 Around that time, it was 16, 19th, early 19th, 19th century. He was born not so far from where Ken

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:57.420
ki Pardeshar Rinpoche and myself also were born, not so far from where we've come from.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.580
 And he always said, he was born on the slopes of the circular mountain of the Chovozetia. So it's

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.340
 the other side of it, the northern side of where we're born.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.260
 Born and he was born there. He was born as the farmers, all the kind of nomad families.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.600
 And when he passed the bone and then he was, I mean, there's so many remarkable signs and all these

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 things, one after another, but then around the edge, like in the 10s, 12s, I think he joined.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 I think in the area that must be close to the like, to the one gullible monasteries, he joined

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.590
 there. But however, in the dream, in the region, and all that has so many different beautiful

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.890
 dreams, and many times, some of them, some of them are vulnerable and so forth, from one after

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 another, all those things.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.800
 And that he has something to do more, more than he has to be joined in that monasteries. But

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.980
 however, he stayed there, I think, for at least four or five years, years, around the 16th or

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:20.340
 around the 17th, then he, he, he had the game, great dream, dream of the Yixin Surya.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.620
 In particular, Yixin Surya, he dreamed, and Yixin Surya came in a dream with many other Dakinis.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 And I think many of them, maybe you all, of course, you all know Dakini. Dakini is a wisdom lady,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.660
 enlightenment ladies, that appeared in the dream.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.980
 And Yixin Surya is one of the principal wisdom ladies, ladies, and she, she came, and she said in

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.060
 the dream, oh, my son is now completely obscured and become dirty, become dirty.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.400
 And he and others bought so much water to him, and they owned the walls, and they're pouring water

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.580
 to him, all, and they're washing and taking bath, and that he kind of almost dreamed the whole

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.980
 night that he's taking bath, and giving the bath, and the cleansing and the death.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.660
 And then, when he woke up, already his day light came, day light's day, woke up, woke up. And then

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.900
 he thought how to do, to leave this monastery, monastery and places, and finally decided he can't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.580
 leave, leave this monastery normally, but he has already nature of quite the creative wisdom

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580
 systems.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.820
 So, therefore, he decided he's going to leave this monastery, act as crazies. So, he wears all the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.180
 different kind of crazy clothes, and he's shotting, wearing the monks' robes and different kind of

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.140
 lay person, lay person clothes and monks' robes, joined together, and then he made the big noise,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.260
 noise, and then he started, he left, he left the monastery.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:17.360
 And then he discovered post-thema, post-thema teachings not so far from our birthplace, known as am

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.100
nyamutru, he discovered that.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.710
 And afterward, then he went to manipulate the discovery, but then also, same time, he met his

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:44.550
 personal teacher, teacher, root teacher, known as Kojam Trini Khanda, who became his root teacher,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.370
 who was one of the great masters of the rajj, or the dronkaji lineages, and performed, received

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.420
 many teachings, and particularly the teachings on the thalam, in the thumu, he, of course, he

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.060
 already very advanced in light beings.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.670
 And as the moment he received those teachings, the moment he put those in practice, he become very

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.420
 advanced on the thalam and thumu practices, in particular, long practices, wind-energy practices,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:13.410
 and then he started beginning revealing thema teachings one after another in many different places

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.440
 throughout Tibet, because through his wisdom, wind-energy power, he didn't really have any troubles

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.580
,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.560
 it was difficult to go to those places, and he began to reword thema teachings, different locations

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.990
, and therefore, Thasang Mumbai is one of the renowned great masters, who reword thema teachings

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.340
 from the objects, from the rock, and from the different places, like rocks, mountains, glaciers,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.460
 lakes, and, yeah, from those places.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.140
 So Thasang Mumbai is one of the renowned, or become one of the renowned, masters of the therma

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.740
 revelation, particularly from the objects and the places.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.360
 So that is what Thasang Mumbai did. Among that, then this teaching, what we are going to follow, is

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.060
 one of his revelation teachings.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:19.540
 This thema teaching is revealed from Southern Tibet, directly south direction of our birthplace.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:27.170
 Places is near, in the modern time, we say this is close to the bhemmahu, very close, always at the

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:35.460
 entrance or threshold of the bhemmahu, and that is called bhemmahyathal, a sacred lotus cake,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:45.360
 named from that cake, then Thasang Mumbai reword these thema teachings, with about three hundred

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.140
 his disciples or audience came when he reword these teachings.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.460
 And when he reword these teachings, because Thasang Mumbai always mentioning which year that he

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.060
 discovered, and which element of that year that he discovered, Thasang Mumbai always teach that.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.550
 Write that down and then, and then also, particularly this time, he wrote the day and the month

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.340
 when he discovered these teachings.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:22.470
 So when we tried to back a chord with Western calendars, and then we found out that Thasang Mumbai

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:31.620
 discovered this kyen'eze, the Awa lokrihora practices in Southern Tibet, in the cake of lotus, on

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:43.220
 1721, July 18, in the morning.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:56.980
 No, it's really sad. It's sad, really, July. So how we found out? Because it said that iron oxia,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:12.420
 if you look at the sadhana, the iron oxia, so when iron oxia comes around 17, as I said, 1690s,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:26.700
 when the iron oxia, 1690s he was born, then after that, when is iron oxia? When we look into the

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.740
 calendar, then it's 1721.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:40.950
 Then he said monkey month and the 25th day in the morning with about 300 audience that he

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.660
 discovered.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:49.460
 So when we look into the monkey month that year, there's generally, according to bed, there's two

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:55.860
 monkey months, which is the fifth month and the sixth month, which always falls in summer.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:05.280
 July or August, it depends. The fifth month changes. They change. So follow with the first monkey

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:13.860
 month according to that system, then, as I said, we found July the Dakini day falls.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:32.090
 July 18, July 18th, Dakini day. He said in the morning. So morning of the July 18th, 1721, that's

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.460
 how we got discovered.
