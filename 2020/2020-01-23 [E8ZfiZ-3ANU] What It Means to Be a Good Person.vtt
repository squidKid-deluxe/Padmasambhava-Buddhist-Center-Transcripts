00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 That means, if our mind, heart is good, then it is good activities.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 If our heart is bad, then it is bad activities.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 And what is that? Good is bad.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 It is, our heart is with love, kindness, compassion.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Whatever activity we did, those are known as good activities.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Not just Buddhism, that every universe is brute.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 And what you do with love and kindness and compassion is good to everyone.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Whether you speak the language, whether you don't speak the language,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 whether you are a believer or a non-believer, it is universal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Even animals will know the actions of our love and kindness and compassion.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 That is really good. That is positive. That is virtuous.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And what is negative? And bad.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Negative is again from the mind, anger, hatred, hope, jealous, and clinging,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and disrespectful, all that, and actions of an era coming out.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Whether it is from the physically, whether it is actually coming from the mentally, it is bad.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It hurts someone. It will disturb the someone.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Don't mention about one's own self. It will disturb one's own self.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 It becomes so dark, so frightful, so eyes, so cold, cold and that creating to the others.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Then during the level of that, how that comes, then it is busy and how much is happening.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Small level within the family members or the friends, it affects them immediately.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And there will be larger levels in all the others, larger levels in cities, in the countries.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 That all start from this negative knowledge, negative heart.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So therefore, we always try to do with mindfulness, which is good, which is bad.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 That is so. Therefore, mindfulness by action, mindfulness of thought, mindfulness of the speech,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 vocal communication, it is really so good.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 We should try to do that always. Our self, your self, as much as you're doing,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 then you will become, or we will become the please peacemaker.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Truly, we become one of the very beautiful stars on the galaxy of the human world.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Truly, it will become. Right? So nice and beautiful.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And we will be happy. We will become one who will do that calm, peaceful and more,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 instead of lifting, lifting to your heart, mind, particularly when you look back,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 what you've ever to do, what you maintain.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 You're standing clearly in a beautiful identity, beautiful college platform,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 and looking back to what you did, you will be so happy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 You will think more great, more happy, or I will continue.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And by the blessings of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas, all the enlightenings,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 may I ever continue to do this. That is the one reason we do that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 That is the one we follow in the footsteps of all those great masters.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 What is the Buddhism called? The warriors.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Those Bodhisattvas are named as warriors.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And the Buddhas are named as the warriors.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 This warrior is not the warrior of the negative emotions.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 They are the warriors of the love, compassion, and wisdom.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 They defeated all this anger, anger, attachment, grasping, clinging.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 They really defeated. Therefore, they are warriors.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 They are called, highly appreciate it, and a novel, what's called a Wartort is a charity.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Wartort is a charity. You become the Wartort's once, a polymer.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 That is what is. So therefore, not for letting go,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 actively is, again in the Buddha teaching, is so, so special, so important.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 It's not a mystery. It's not something that can't be like that you have to do.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 It's simple things. It's just way of the lives, our lives, within that life.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And it's the everyday lives, everyday, whether day or night.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And we can't reflect with that. It's just so everyday, so nice.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Your friends, the family members, they will become so, so calm, peaceful,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 bound within the love. And then what that, when you have that situation,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 what do you call it? Heaven is in a sweet home.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Truly, that is a sweet home of Heaven. You start Heaven right now.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Not just a wedding, something in the future, kind of an opening, right now.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 That is Heaven. That's the realm that really started.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So therefore, this reflecting of the God action is very important.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Live, don't essay. That is really mindfulness. Principal is mindfulness.
