00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 The intellectual studying and contemplating and then studying meditating practices on one

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.240
 is known as the more counter-season to aperol, conhermatory development of practices. That

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.540
 is not really studying too much, all that trilaru variety is said to be studying vinayas, sutras,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.280
 abhidhamma. Commonly is on those teachings by great masters, both in India in a tuition

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.880
 and kind of all those teachings, like those are not the scholars which practice in that.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 But this is more counter-easy, aperol, the ascetic imagery. Many a times in speechability,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 the kustal, let yoga easy, kind of you won't go into the target, not just going through

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 all the variety of the different ages, different sizes, and coming, right, immediately coming

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:05.280
 back to the poor performance of the practices. Whether you study and become the great scholars,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 you have to practice. Whether you didn't really study too much, but just the basic teachings

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.480
 of the authentic, meaning instruction, and also need practice. Both need practices. Without

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.080
 the practices, realization will not grow. Even in the teachings, even you memorize all

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.880
 the teachings, even you know all of the teachings really thoroughly, but if we don't practice

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 it, then you won't get realization. We will get some benefit, definitely benefit, but

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.680
 if someone that is a scholar, the kind of knows, knows or the expert knows all the treasures

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 of the rich people or the kings and queens, and even you know all those treasures, what

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 they have, that won't help that person who knows all the treasures, what they have. And

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 one who practices them, then that's what really the important need practices. And so therefore,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 the practice is so important, and this what we're following is the essential simple practices

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 of how to get the enlightenment or the realization and perform the goals. In order to do this

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.080
 practice, as I mentioned always, and that we all, you and me, everyone needs to understand

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.680
 our motivation, correct the motivation. More joy, more appreciation, more thankful, really

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 thank, bring up that attitude. Not just making up the joy that though grateful, without any

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 different reason to cover up that, no, we have so many reasons to be joy and appreciate it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 and be grateful. Bring up those really good, make that highlight of the joy and appreciation

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.880
 and be grateful. That is the number one in Buddhism that is foundation. And foundation

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.280
 of the practices, that is also central column of the practices. We need always joyful, we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:21.080
 need always grateful, we need always, we go more carnival, happy and contentment. And

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.880
 the second is the bodhicata. Again, you heard so many times about the bodhicata, and I heard

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.080
 so many times about the bodhicata, but how much really we activated. Even we know that

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 meaning of the bodhicata. How much we activated. We have this time, not just only carnival,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.080
 on the intellectual level, but we have to bring up that from heart. Heart and bring

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.480
 up that love and kindness, compassion. Compassion for all living beings. Our practice, our

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.280
 meditation,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 our study, whatever we do, do, wish really that will help. Whatever we do is related

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.880
 with spiritual or Dharma, really wish that benefit for all sending beings. At the same

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.880
 time, also in the teaching of prevention, correcting our self, re-standing. If something that we

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.880
 are doing dethralled from our, the brand goal of the bodhicata, central pathway of the bodhicata,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.880
 trying to come back. Who was correct? We individually trying to correct that. That is known as

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.480
 practicing a Dharma. We are not always perfect. No one is perfect. Even though we are a perfect

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 beautiful nation, but we make a lot of different carnival things happen, even without any

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 intention, due to our happy dependence. Happy dependence is not just only we develop it.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.080
 This lifetime, according to the teaching, it develops so long ago, so many lifetime before.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 Therefore, this carnival, the old habit and unwholesome happy dependence, we don't have

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 to make effort to come. It just sounds so easy. We just become the master of the unwholesome

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 happy dependence, really. That is therefore, we need to correct our self. For that reason,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:33.480
 great teacher, Buddha Kepa Muni said, "Be yourself a teacher or be teacher to yourself

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.480
 as your teacher." Who will do? You will do the best. You will. Not by someone, correct.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 Correct yourself. That is known as mindfulness. That is wisdom. That is intelligence. That

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 is smart moves. Right with that, obviously. Really, that is what in the teaching, always

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.480
 men get screwed. I mean, that bodhicata attitude, right, will correct that old thing, bodhicata.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 And then, do the fury, the realization, the very understanding. How to begin the purity

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.480
 state? Again, of course, three various states. But how to begin that? At least have the pure

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.480
 perceptions, not to become judgmental, not to become skeptical, doubt and hesitation,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.480
 kind of suspicious to everyone, including even our own shadow. Shadow is doubt, carnival

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:42.480
 having doubt and hesitation, become so skeptical. That won't leave anything. Even more dilemma,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.480
 more carnival cornered ourselves, more to the dark side, and really won't bring anything.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.480
 Pretty more pure perception. That is the beginning of the purity, understanding the realization.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:03.480
 Nature is pure, but that purity state is not just also blind believing that with intelligence,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.480
 the wisdom. Bring up that. Always wisdom with you, your wisdom or our wisdom. Your and

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:20.480
 my wisdom should be always with our own activities. Our activities of the body, speech, mind is

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:29.480
 guided by wisdom and mindfulness. Mindfulness and wisdom are combined to it. It's very

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 special. It's our own intelligence, our own trails, and have thoughts. And then bring

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.480
 them all, realize that we can have those thoughts. All these various, three various states.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:50.480
 Reginald of home. All the forms that are enlightened. That's what all the virgins teach.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:58.480
 Esoteric Buddhism. Reginald. All is a reginald of home. And all is a reginald of home. And

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 all mind and space are reginald of mind. It's natural. Naturally enlightened status. Why?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.480
 Again, deep down every goal, deep down why it is? Because our mind, our nature of mind

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.480
 is already enlightened, according to the absolute teachings of the body, already enlightened.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 This whole, this display, the form and the song and the spirit, display of ordinary

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:37.480
 Kundalini from our own mind. From our mind. That's really according to the teaching. Even

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.480
 though this moment looks at a very different distance. This distance is all these poems

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.480
 and songs are very distant from us and we are here kind of there. But that's the goal

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 known as dualities. Duality blocks. Reality of all poems are in that display of our own

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:06.480
 nature of mind. Ask to our dreams. For example, when we dreaming, we have homes, we have

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 mountains, we have houses, we have songs, somebody is talking or singing. And each time we are

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.480
 thinking what this, that thing is. Each time. Where that old display come from? It's nothing

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:34.480
 but our mind, all this mind. Similarly, and for that reason, one of the children said,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.480
 we are in a sleeping, deep duality dream, dream sleep. We sleep and then display all things.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:52.480
 That thing becomes so, so regimented, so tight, so separate. But reality, nature is

00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:01.480
 flexible, nature is pure and enlightenment is. For that reason, the vision of the enlightenment,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 vision of the Buddha are pure. Because they don't have habit better of the dualities,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 it plays a way. And they now completely worship them display. Compassion, worship them in

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:23.480
 compassion, unity, all displays are the enlightenment and wisdom display. Often we

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:31.480
 heard opulent is display of the wisdom in computers. Because that Buddha enlightens

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.480
 but that's reflected all poems. So that is to begin with that, called pure perception

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.480
 of purity, understanding the realization. So I have more power of purity, understanding

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:53.480
 all those poems. That's really how we begin practice. Those are not necessarily correct

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 in our motivation, at least kind of lining up to the reality, where the nature it is,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.480
 not just always stay in the kind of like narrow, habit-dependent corner that we are

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.480
 hanging out all the time. We're not trying to change the course, trying to change the

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:18.480
 way of our thinking and bring back to our origin qualities. So those are known as

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.480
 motivations. Motivation, intention is so important.
