00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
 It's the same term as Acharya Chandrakirti. Chandrakheti and Chandragomin is not a fully

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:21.360
 ordered monk. He was an opasca, and it's called one opascan called Gomi. Gomi, I think he belongs

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.600
 with one of the tradition of the sub-schools of the Caravana, but of course is Mahayana

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.480
 practitioners.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.040
 Mahayana practitioners, very famous. He was a yogi of Avalokiteshara and Aras. In the teachings,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.000
 he had had the opportunity ever to talk to Avalokiteshara as person to person, or

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 Tara as person to person. He has such highly enlightened realization things. Also, very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.140
 famous scholars. He wrote so many books, teachings, and then there was a barigul. Also, he wrote a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.400
 very

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 famous book of the Sanskrit grammar. Grammar called Chandappa, again his name, Chandappa.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 Very famous, which I had still used that. Very famous. There is this very very beautiful story.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.960
 He says that one time Chandappa was visiting Nalanda monastery universities, and when

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 Chandappa came to Nalanda monastery universities, at that time Chandappa was head master,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.440
 or the head abode of the Nalanda monastery universities. And then, of course, some

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.020
 people know Chandappa is a great master. Many people don't know he is a great master. But then,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.200
 they

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 kind of had the rumors of great master Chandappa visiting in the Nalanda monastery universities.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:02.240
 That news, rumor, gradually reached to the Chandrakriti. And Chandrakriti came himself

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.510
 asked me this way, and he said he asked Chandappa Chandappa Chandappa Chandappa Chandappa Chandappa

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.920
, "Are you the Chandappa Chandappa Chandappa?" He said, "Yes, that was I am known in the world."

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 So, when he said that, "Oh, such a great master visited on this monastery. I don't want to release.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.880
 You come like this way. I'd like to make full reception to you. To you, could you go with

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.360
 time being? And I will edit the reception, and then you come back." And Chandappa called me like,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.670
 "No, this and that things." But finally, I gave it to him. And he said, "I am not fully ordered

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.000
 more.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 Do you all fully order more? How you can make reception to me? This is not a right to them."

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.280
 And then, Chandappa Chandappa, they thought short time, he said, "I have checked me. Don't worry.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.400
 I will do it. I will make perfect." So, then they acted. So, he went for a while, whatever,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.480
 and then made the big receptions. And Chanda Gomme, they put on the chariot, and all the monks and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.600
 everyone was making big receptions. Right in front of Chanda Gomme, there is a big stone stage of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.440
 Mejishi. Mejishi, they put that. So, in a way, they are making the reception for the Mejishi

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 stages. And Chanda Gomme is holding that anyway, holding that, and then they moved. But while Ch

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.480
anda

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.920
 Gomme is in the chariot, he feels so devoted to the Mejishi. And he prays the Mejishi,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.880
 simultaneously, this big, long, beautiful, really precious to Mejishi. And this stone stage,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.080
 in this technique, he said that, "The stone stage, you turn the neck like this. You taste really, I

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.200
 have that color?"

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.120
 And then, everyone said, "The stage is left like that." So, it's called yami-dyum, and everybody

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.680
 said,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.760
 corked neck, our locally, sorry, corked neck, corked neck Mejishi, yami-dyum.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.240
 This was one of the trade-offs of the Nala Monastry University. So, then they came there,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.400
 and Chanda Gomme came there. But then, Chanda Gomme is one of the great master of the mind-own

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.880
 schools.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.640
 And Chanda Gedi is one of the great masters of the Prasan Gama Deva schools. Now, they started

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.120
 debating,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 the teachers, they started debating. One took the position of the mind-own school, and the other

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 told the Prasan Gama Deva. Oh, Madam Gama schools. And they started debating. Debating, debating,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:09.520
 debating. He said, "The debate went on and on over 12 years." And they couldn't make this

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.000
 difference.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.120
 And then, when they're debating, he said, looks like, I mean, Chanda Gedi is a more sharper mind,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.620
 sharper mind. And when he's debating, it looks like Chanda Gomme almost lost, lost debate. But then

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.680
,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.480
 they stopped at that time. And the next day, they started, Chanda Gomme has more to debate,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.640
 and more things to put. And then, in the teaching, he said, "It must be this Chanda Gomme must have

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.920
 someone who's teaching, and stopped at something, totally, totally must be, must be." So, then,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.680
 well, they finish the debate. And Chanda Gomme went his cabin, and Chanda Gedi went back to his

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.600
 room, whatever that. Then, and then, Chanda Gomme thought, it must have someone really tutoring,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.960
 otherwise, every day, Lusla is going to lose. But the next day, he has all fresh things to debate.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.520
 And so, couldn't that, I'm going to check. Is anybody talking to him? And he went,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:25.680
 and they, sneakily went in the window of the door, sneakily. Inside, there is,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:34.000
 our guru, Kritishwara, Stone State, he is teaching as, like, father to the son. He said, like,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.360
 even pointing this and that, like this, pointing to Chanda Gomme, everything. And then,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.240
 Chanda Gedi said, in his teaching, he said, "Chanda Gomme, open the door immediately,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.560
 or break his kindness, father. I never thought you have the discrimination." So, he said to our

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.640
 local Chanda, "I never thought you have the discriminations." He said, "I have not discrimination.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:08.240
 He just asked me coaching, so I'm teaching him." And then, also in teaching, he said, that, like,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.040
 Pingal, the Chanda, our location of Chanda is the Pingal Mountain State, just a stop right there.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.280
 So, the stage becomes like this, like this, this. And this is also one of the treasures of the,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:30.080
 of the Nalanda Monastery. So, therefore, and then, later on, even these villagers, and the cowboys,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.600
 started talking, started, gianting the abilities of these great two masters. Everybody kind of

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.400
 started joking, joking. One said this, other said this, and they started joining that. So, in this

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.560
 teaching, see, there's nothing really concrete that you can't, it's just a border, so I highly

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.520
 realized that. That tells the Mahanun school, you know, all this, how special they are. It's not

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.720
 really, they're a subtle point, they just kind of talk in that, but there's, generally, it's all

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.240
 special, special. So, that's the greatest story of the, of the Miwa school. The Chanda,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.880
 Chanda Gomu is one of the great famous masters in Buddhism.
