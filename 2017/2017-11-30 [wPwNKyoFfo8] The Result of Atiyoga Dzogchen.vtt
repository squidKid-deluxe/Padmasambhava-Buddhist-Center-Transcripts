00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 Now again we strengthen our critical motivation of "The Jewel" and appreciation and bodhishtatam

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.880
 and as well as understanding of the Dzogchen Shedra retreat on the reality level.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.120
 Everything is in a life mistake. There's nothing really missed on it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.680
 And God is already a life mistake, according to Dzogchen Shedra.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.280
 And that is like start with our own nature of the mind and as well as all this phenomenal existence

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.280
.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.000
 So, we strengthen that beautiful those intelligent thought and then we go to the teaching.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And now the teaching as we went through and one after another according to the teaching

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.240
 and now we are in a finalized stage.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:57.440
 Financed stage is the result, and that result of the Dzogchen in the teaching said again

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:14.320
 that Dzogchen, the result of the Atiyoa is the ordinary inherited essence of the enlightenment

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:25.600
 that now reworked. There's nothing really achieved upon God but reworked your inherited nature.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 So that is what that answer said. So that means the reality level, we're not gaining anything God.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 But what we did, we purified all in the Dzogchen Shedra's liberty.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.550
 All the blockage, the defilements of that block of the ordinary shining beauty of the absolute

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.520
 nature.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.120
 Or beauty of the primordial wisdom or other world, Buddha Samhindvadara.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.920
 As we said the other day, the original inherited our own nature of mind is absolute Buddha Samhindv

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.600
adara.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.080
 Absolute Buddha Samhindvadara. That being residing all the time in with us or now in a way we are

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.600
 human beings with that within our heart chapters. That never changed anything from the time

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.840
 delusion until now. We went through recorded teaching in the samsara arts and dance

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.480
 in all different places of the six realms through the cosmic wind force that created by one's own

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.520
 south. We went all different ways. But nature never changed at all. It remained exactly as it is.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.120
 And not just it remained as it is throughout all those delusion times when we are deluded by this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 our own creation of duality. That primordial wisdom or absolute that Buddha Samhindvadara

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.560
 is guiding us throughout the time. And as we're talking yesterday intelligence, knowledge,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 those all are as beams of light of this primordial wisdom. That is guiding us all the time. And

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 then

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.120
 plus loving kindness, compassion, all that is light of this primordial Samhindvadara, absolute our

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.600
 Samhindvadara which is here. So the reality is nothing really changed. Actually it's even in the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.520
 midst of the here is the duality or here is our cosmic force is kind of like crushing us but still

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:51.760
 is guiding primogems our own intelligence, our own love, compassion, wisdom, understanding,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.440
 knowledge and included as common senses. All that is really is the radiating energy of our own

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 ordinary nature, absolute or the Buddha Samhindvadara. This is not just only we human beings,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.920
 even the animals, even all those beings six names every and each has every and each has

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.320
 has intelligence versus us. That's why in a gracious teaching, Buddha Chaturman is in the teaching,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.960
 every living being inherited at the Buddha nature. No one is exception that don't have it.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.840
 Everyone has. Have you worked for that? We very well. If you don't work for that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.960
 and cannot carry with force, then we will be deluded. This delusion is of course, you know,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.120
 you know, and I heard it is our own creation. Dualities is nothing but is our own creation.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.160
 So therefore, by the practicing of the Dzogchen, Dzogchen through us in the Chatur and Toga

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.800
 practices,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.720
 now what we revere, revere the organically inherited that absolute Buddha Samhindvadara.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:21.680
 Now, a brilliant is hiding free from any entrance or any blockage of dualities. Duality will be

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:30.160
 transcendent or liberated to the Dharmakaya state or its own natural states. Duality is not

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.720
 permanent.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.480
 Duality is temporarily developed. It's a little bit in a teaching. Lower, lower means temporary.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.160
 It's duality or the obscura is temporary. But this temporary state is a long time.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.720
 It's not just a long time. It's been a long time temporarily. That is, but whether it's a long time

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:02.560
 or not, it is temporary. Now that developed. And for example, in the sky, cloud is not permanent.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:12.640
 Not permanent. It's temporary. Temporary. Same with duality, it's temporary. Because it is

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.360
 delusions,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.320
 because it is permanent. Now with our power of the intelligence or power of the primordial

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:28.000
 what's the technique that we use, that the smell or liberated then revere the organ and nature

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.720
 exactly as it is. And that for that reason, then as I said, it is Dokkintanda Vyamgivnanda said

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.000
 the result of the Atayoga is the organically inherent or essence of enlightenment. That it's

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.480
 the reward. Reward always matured. Matured to one's own son. There's nothing really to gain.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.480
 Nothing you've got. New things. Nothing you gain. So that is what it is. Therefore,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.200
 this is, the Buddha summoned the Buddha. Instead of the Buddha summoned the Buddha,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.600
 now we are right. Absolute state of the Buddha summoned the Buddha, organ inherently state.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.440
 Now we are right. We went. So that means we've been wandering in the samsara

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.080
 by the force of our own delusions to all the different places in the samsara. Now we come back,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:33.360
 now we regain our organ inheritance or our organ dominance. We regain back to that nature state.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:41.680
 At that time, when we regain and then we get three this, oh sorry, four third competences,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.280
 that I said yesterday, let's do the four competences, four competences. And that is also

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.080
 in the Dokkintandra said the tandara of the dual hip Dokkintandras. The unshakeable change,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:02.640
 unshakeable of the great four competences will tell you that you arrived at the final

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:11.760
 explanations. Unshakeable four competences. I'm translating competences. Then, in it to be the

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:20.000
 thing that this competence or it can be, I mean it's the final goal, four goals. It tells

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.440
 or measures your final achievement. That will tell us. And what are those? As again I said

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.000
 yesterday,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.880
 really. And here she can say that when you heard, heard the suffering, the sadness, the difficulty,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.080
 challenges of the three lower realms such as hell realms and hungry gods realms, animal realms,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:52.400
 any of those and their kind of duration, their situation, circumstances, there is you don't have,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.600
 that individual, the yogi and the yogi is never going to be scared of them. Scared of that because

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:07.280
 on the organ, the Samyantabhata, the absolute Samyantabhata, that nature has no delusions,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.760
 not deluded those. Even, not even the name of the delusion is not existing within that

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:23.680
 natural status. So therefore, you don't, that individually has no fears, no fears at all,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.240
 hearing, any of that plus all the samsaras and what it is samsara, what we call, inhuman rims,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.840
 difficulty troubles. Those are like as we call, particularly connected with samsara in the

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.600
 teaching said, the birth, getting old, getting old, sickness and death, those are the kind of

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:50.080
 major challenges that we go through on that. In asura ram, those are the piping and the curling,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:57.360
 armpit, those are the troubles related with that, a lot of troubles and god's ram pouring down and

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.750
 aspirating, all the moving, moving and those are the troubles. But whatever you have, that

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.240
 individual,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:13.680
 that yogi and yoginis has no, not shaken by anything because it is all explanation of the

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.920
 delusions, deluded situations. Now you're not deluded, that individual you're not deluded.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:27.520
 So therefore, no scares, no scare. So that competence, competence. And then finally,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:35.440
 finally is, not finally, second one is, with that individually, that individual who reaches that

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.320
 status, now you reach the final stages, final stages of the awareness or the epithelus,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.360
 just simply say, raka. When you're not that individually arrived to the final stage,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.080
 the ultimate stage of panakkal status, of the status, there in that stage, generally that

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:03.840
 stage, there's not names of, even not name of the samsara, not even a name of samsara existence.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.400
 So why you are concerned of the good karma or the bad karmas or the expecting for the good karma,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:18.960
 something like that. That notion, that is not even not existing in that stage. So therefore,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:28.160
 nothing, no expectations, no hopes for that individualism to the samsara. And then the second

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.600
 one, the competence is, and again in the absolute level of the Buddha, Samadha Bhattar, the

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.160
 absolute

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.680
 Buddha, Samadha Bhattar, we're talking to the inherited our own, our own nature. There is nothing

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:51.050
 also not even existing or this is good or nirvana is good. That notion is not really existing at

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.280
 all,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:12:00.000
 at all. This is delusions, that notion is juhanaki, that is delusions. For therefore,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.280
 but then there's nothing really, nirvana has nothing to gain actually, there's nothing you're

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:12.880
 gaining anything. For that reason, there is, you don't really expecting something to gain more

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.560
 hobby. So you have the great again, confidence, confidence, and there's nothing

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:27.280
 hoping something to be in the niranas, niranas. And then, and even again, so that's the third one.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:34.800
 The fourth one is when you heard all the different explanations of the dharmakaya,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.840
 when you heard explanation of the call of the sambhokaya, pipe certain in all this,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.040
 and in the makaya call of all this, when you heard all that individually, when they heard this,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:52.720
 there's nothing have any excitement for that, or I like to gain that. You already have that

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.960
 everything. So there's nothing more gaining, more excitement, more convenient for that. There's

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.480
 nothing you already gain. All that is again, delusion status, explanations, reality level,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.480
 everything is completed, and everything is great in the economic status, everything is in that

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:20.960
 natural status. So that is making, when you have that confidence, when you have that realization,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:30.640
 what that confidence, that is also measurement of the new final achievement, final destination.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:38.160
 That is in a way, sambok, now that's it. And that is also applying to your own, our own sound.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.560
 When you break that status, then there's not, there's a community built for those great masters,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.960
 masters in their songs. Songs, they say, for example, great masters, one of these songs,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.400
 how joyous yourself on this life, how joyous of next lives, there's nothing to be,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:06.160
 to be, not joyous, it's all the same. This life, next lives, lives. Also the really great

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:14.240
 master, the other great master too, when you break that status, then there is this. And also

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:22.160
 that is, this is the final gaining or results, results. And then when you reach that status,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:29.430
 and how, again, so this is another Dokki that that other day we listed, Durya sambha yenge merongu

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.920
 ji.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:37.600
 It's heart, heart barrier of the Buddha Veda sakos. In that, in enlightenment, in Dokki ji ji,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.800
 there is two, two kind of enlightenment, completely, perfectly, completely enlightenment,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:54.560
 and also enlightened or enlightened, so perfectly, completely enlightened and enlightened. Maybe

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.960
 just

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:03.920
 use that word. And what that means is it, the perfectly enlightened is that who reached that,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:14.640
 who reached that wisdom rainbow body, that means the outer gate, the physical outer gate

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.480
 is dissolved into, into the heap of light. Light, there's nothing any left residues in the heart.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.680
 That is known as perfect enlightenment. And then enlightenment, enlightenment,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:38.000
 what that means? Here in that is, again, great master, Jyummi nova, said, the work and said,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.440
 that is, is the enlightenment, that means when these duties are entered in our body, Narana,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.920
 that individual moment with the past, or during that period, short period, there is a lot of

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.560
 beams of light coming, coming. There's delicious songs that are happening. And there is then also

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:07.040
 such as, as the bodies, when there, there's so many pillars, vast pillars, or kind of like,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.080
 like small, small kind of fractions of the relatives coming. And then also their bodies

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:25.920
 become smaller, smaller, and art is shaken. Those are known as, then, known as the enlightened,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:33.680
 those masters who had those, those qualities, or those, some of those, and then is, is known

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:40.560
 as the enlightenment. And if you, who, who are they? Who got those? The first one is perfect

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.280
 enlightenment. That is like, Jyotsu Sangewabso. Jyotsu Sangewabso is one of the great, like,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.370
 grand, grand, grand student of the Mamal Matara. And then, of course, Mamal Matara himself, I

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.440
 really

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.080
 also came to, to have a tour, tour. So, this Jyotsu Sangewabso and Jyotsu Ninte, as you know,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.800
 he is passing under, must remember, he really reached to the, he dissolved the body, physical

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.560
 body into light, and then went. And the next one is enlightenment, is like, who was that? That is,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.600
 for example, leading example of great master umkimba, umkiba. That's what they use, the example,

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.720
 by grand master, with the Dara, Yumilambas. Yumilambas. Yumilambas. So, that is God. And then,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.560
 also, there is many, when they also, the sign of that achievement, realization, finding that

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:44.000
 resistance, and there is many kind of explanations in the teaching said, sometimes, the, the

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.720
 residues are, the physical residues are completely dissolved, and it just only become the, kind of,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.440
 like, a small molecules, or small particles, which are just really, is dissolved, that. And then,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.120
 as well as, also, there is those, those three monsters, where dying, sky-like dying, or going

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.080
 into the Mahatma body, and the one as, like, sky-like, and that also, like, there's a dissolved,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:15.120
 kind of, physical things that, kind of, merge to the space, spaces. So, those are, those many

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:22.800
 subdivisions, you see that. And who is those, those masters, again, example, say, who kind of,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:30.000
 like, left, like, kind of, all their physical things become as, like, uh, molecules, or other,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.920
 particles, sub-particles of that. That is, then, and become, also, that means, everything becomes

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.880
 light state. Sub-particles are light, light. So, all that light, who is the examples of those? And

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:49.840
 those are known as the master, great master, Bimal, sorry, not Bimal, Bhaktana, the disciple,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:57.280
 disciple, Paim, Mopam Gombo. Paim, Mopam Gombo, in a succession of seven generations, one after

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:04.790
 another, really, all that went, Rambo body, simple, we can tell, Rambo body, or they transcended

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.120
 their

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:12.880
 physical, and sub-particles, and it become light, light, one after another, those. And then,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:22.960
 then, so, and then, those people who have that, then, again, it transcended the Western Rambo

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.840
 bodies. Plus, transcended the Western Rambo body is the examples of the Gaurabhama Sambho,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.080
 which is the Rambo, Ascended Western Rambo body, and great master, Bimal Materas. Also, we can use

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.680
 as Ishinthogya, in the teachings said that, too, Ishinthogya has become the Ascended Western Rambo

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.800
 body. She really did not die or die as normally. In the teachings said, she flew left in the sky,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:56.080
 sky, two Dakini's kind of merged to her, and three of them, and merged to her, and she kind of flew

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:03.920
 away in the sky. Those were seen by the cow herd, or those people who go to the upper animal,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.400
 animal, in that they came, all came in the mountains, and then, in the mountain, they came,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.600
 they did the beautiful Ganachakra offerings, at the end of the Ganachakra or Chok ceremony,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:20.000
 and the two Dakini's, this merged to her, and these two Dakini's the Kala Siddhi, and I think,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.600
 Kala Siddhi, and Trachi Chindi. Trachi Chindi, these two are merged, kind of dissolved to it,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 and then she flew away in the sky, and then these shepherds are, what, very kind of immediate, that

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.960
 even they saw that kind of happened there, and they went to the place where they did some ceremony,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:46.720
 there's left remaining, left all food, and they had, and instantly they got big realization,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.640
 and really big realization, those were the teachings said. So that is, is the, is the

00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:00.080
 final realization. In the mountain, you reach realization, then out to that stages, and then

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.960
 now you reach the final stage of the Dharmakaya, as we said. When you reach the Dharmakaya stages,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.040
 although you benefit from all navy beings, then you begin to emanate it, many emanates. Those are

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:21.520
 known in Sambokaya, Abhaya, and in Dharmakaya, and there are so many emanations, emanations,

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.880
 these are all that display of the Dharmakaya, or the Sambokaya, this place, in order to benefit

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.520
 from all navy beings, and then benefit it to all, the beings of six rims, and so that is

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:47.440
 really the, what's called, really a result of the, of the Ati-yoga, Ati-yoga practices.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:56.320
 So that is then, we complete it. We complete the Dzogchin Shedda, in a way, very essential,

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:03.600
 event, kind of quite thorough, one after another, we went, and so we completed. Now we just, let's

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 look back what we discussed last year and this year.
