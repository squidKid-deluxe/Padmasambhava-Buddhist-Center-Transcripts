00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 He describes everything we are discussing in the pure land, in all these different pure lands, in

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:15.280
 different environments, what in the Rana teachings said, all this, the source of this, all of this,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.480
 this is uncompounded.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.260
 Source of everything is uncompounded. That is love. Now, what that means? Source of all is uncomp

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.840
ounded. What that uncompounded is?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:44.820
 What? No. It can't be divided. Yeah, it can be divided. But this all source of all, what's called

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.400
 the uncompounded is, now we're not looking outside.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.820
 Now, of course, you're not also talking. If I say simply, it's your mind. Your mind, your nature of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.800
 the mind, or my nature of the mind, is uncompounded. Uncompounded.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:22.790
 Now, you can think, is your mind is compounded or uncompounded? You can debate with the Buddha now.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.200
 That's what it said, the Buddha summoned by the city.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:40.600
 Nature's mind is uncompounded. Nature of the mind. Your mind and everyone's nature is uncompounded.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 And then, there's more explanation of this mind now, uncompounded.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 Compounded means what, actually? What? Compounded? Yeah. Made up of other things? That's true.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.180
 Compounded means made up of other things. Made up of many combinations. Compounded. This is

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.690
 compounded. This, all objects are compounded. Compounded. So, it's uncompounded. Mind, nature of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.720
 the mind, our mind is uncompounded.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:31.150
 Now, more or more, turn the page. Next page. Page two. What is it? Self-arising. Self-arising. You

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.640
 ask, it's true? You ask that. That's what it says. It's uncompounded. Self-arising.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.280
 That means there's no any other factors, no any other conditions, cause, arises. It's come. It's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.120
 self-arising. That's what's called self-arising. Self-arising.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.740
 Then, next again, explain more about this. Infinite. It's infinite. Now, mind, nature of the mind

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.280
 is infinite.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.160
 That means your nature, mind, mind, nature of the mind is infinite. Infinite. And what we call the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.160
 infinite, we call mind is infinite, nature of the mind is infinite.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:31.190
 And then, again, more or more, explain here. Next one is what? Inconceivable. Inconceivable. Also,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.040
 this is what our beauty, we have this magic here now. This is inconceivable.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:51.140
 And here also is said, inexpressible. Inexpressible. So now, mind is what? And then here, more or

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.780
 more, we say this. Also, within this nature, there is no even label of the names of the samsara nir

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.560
vanas.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.850
 Within this mind, nature of the mind, there's no name of the samsara, there's no names of the nir

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.940
vana. Don't mention there is samsara nirvanas. Even there's no names. That's what we say.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.720
 That is nature of the mind. Your nature of mind, my nature of the mind, mind, that is, so it is

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:32.220
 uncombounded, it is self-arising, infinite, inconceivable, inexpressible, even the names and labels

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.820
 of this. Names of the samsara nirvanas.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:48.040
 So this is the source of everything. This is the source of everything. Our old feelings, our old

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.280
 emotions, are also arising from this.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:01.260
 Love and compassion, wisdom, what we talk is so spiritual, it's also arising from this. Everything

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:09.480
 what we talk, what we discuss, is all arising from this. And all is also merging there.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:21.130
 Just merging. That's what's called is here. The vastness. It's vastness. There's no cloud at all.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:33.360
 No congestion. And yet there's no shortages. All arising. All coming.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:47.150
 We never heard, "We are the shortage of conceptions." You heard anything? That's what this nature

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:58.080
 is. This is now as zoki teaching. It's pointing to you, to us. This is what nature is, mind is, is.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.940
 We take care of this. We're taking care of everything. That's what it is. Really, if we take care

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.480
 of this, we're taking care of everything.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:16.210
 In order to do this, there is meditation, practicing. All this brain calm and peace, that will be

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.480
 more relaxing. Those are lined up to this nature, naturally.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.940
 Caring with the consumption, going up to each consumption, all that, then we are almost like

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.580
 following our shadows. Shadows, and then it's most tired. All right. And then we have regulated

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.480
 that more and more things. It's kind of like, what's called, kitties chasing the tails.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.590
 That's it. Going on and around. It's one's own. It's just much more tired. Maybe at the beginning,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.480
 it's quite good. Fun. Fun.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:59.320
 It's pretty tired. Boring. So this is what it is. And here, that's it. Here's it. Knowing this,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.480
 next third line, knowing this, satinist, is Buddhahold.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:15.460
 If you realize this nature, you realize and abide in this nature, then what is? Buddhahold. That is

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.480
 Buddhahold.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:26.830
 Or your way to the Buddhahold. Or your way to the Naranas. Naranas. And opposite of knowing, what

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.480
 is this? Then here's it.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:41.670
 Unknowing. Beings, wonder, wondrous, compensous. Then when in this myth, knowing, unknowing beings,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:48.480
 then wandering in the samsaras. Samsaras.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:58.560
 Samsara is one's own creation, display of this mind, as we said. It started with unknowing, then

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:07.210
 grasping, or ignorance, grasping, and then all those different emotions, then created all these

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.480
 massive things.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:17.530
 It's kind of like we're carried by nightmares, nightmares, carried on and on. And we had this, we

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.480
're wondering, in that our territories, generally it's called samsara.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.160
 But if samsara is kind of more specifically to highlight of the territorial way, how we're

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.480
 wondering that? It's called the three rams here.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:40.480
 The next step is, may all beings of the three rams, rams. That's what it's called. Three rams.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 Three rams are what? In Buddha's teaching, you see desire rams, poem rams, and poem-less rams.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:09:00.830
 In Buddha's teaching, I'll say that there's desire rams, called rams of desires, and rams of the

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.480
 poems, and poem-less, rams of poem-less.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.480
 There's three rams. And we are, we are in the desire rams.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:20.070
 And what that means is desire rams. In the teaching it says, desire rams, kind of, beings are more

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:27.020
 desired to the sensory place, you know, object with a particular, such as male and female contracts

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.480
.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:37.480
 Contract, that is very, very much desired. Whether you are, what kind of poems you are, whether you

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:45.250
 are women, beings, whether you are animals, or even poems you are, you are kind of inclined with

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:52.480
 that contract, pleasures, or the desire, and that's what is known as desire rams.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:59.060
 Desire rams. And then there's another rams that we don't see in the Buddha's teaching. Another two

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.480
 rams. Two rams, those are the poem rams and poem-less rams.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.140
 Poem rams are like, according to teaching in the category, this we don't see, but they are, can be

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:17.480
 like, God's rams. God is not the singular, he blurs.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.420
 And high status of the living kind of like, God-made situation, they're called gods. There's many

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:31.480
 male gods, female gods, and so forth. Gods and so many beings, it's according to teaching.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:42.630
 And these rams, I had such beautiful poems in the teaching, that their bodies are so beautiful.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:50.960
 Beautiful, they are not also completely kind of like, like too much with the, with the, to together

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.480
, so all kind of like that, contractors.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:00.300
 They have the every pleasures, not only that kind of contract with that. And they are also, poems

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:08.480
 are so beautiful, so, therefore, it is named as poem rams. Those are gods, God's rams.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.850
 There's another God's rams, those are poem-less rams. And those are, they don't have mental,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:22.250
 physical body, existing, but they are more like mental bodies. Mental body, and therefore, it's

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.480
 named as poem-less rams.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.590
 So this, no matter what, even this kind of appearance, they are, but still they are in samsara, s

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:41.480
amsara. So, and that, therefore, then here, said, may all the beings of three rams, rams, all rams.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.510
 And then, said, what, wishing, for example, the Buddha, Samhinde, Badra, what is wishing? Realized

00:11:47.510 --> 00:12:07.480
 nature of the inconceivable source. That is what wishing, wishing here, inconceivable source.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:15.020
 What is this inconceivable source? It's again, back to the nature of the mind. May everyone

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:25.480
 recognize, realize this meaning of the true nature of the mind. They may realize this.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:34.230
 This is what is real now. So that's the really about that sentence. The next one is, then again, is

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.480
 continually here, more teachings, more continually.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:48.830
 How? Now, Narana is started. Narana is how, Narana is started. Again, it's the same source, but how

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.480
 the Narana is started.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:59.490
 And how? Kunduzanko, or the Samhinde Badra, Buddha Samhinde Badra, here, Kunduzanko also said here,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.370
 to Kunduzanko, or is also named the Buddha Samhinde Badra, Buddha Samhinde Badra, rich

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.480
 enlightenment. That's what here.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:17.480
 Now, this is, this is started with the page, two last lines. Furthermore, I, Kunduzanko proclaims.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.470
 But Kunduzanko, Buddha Samhinde Badra, according, in the Buddha teaching, or the Vedic teaching,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:29.480
 Buddha Samhinde Badra, or the Samhinde Badra, Sanskrit name, and Kunduzanko is a Tibetan.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.740
 That translated Samhinde Badra into Tibet as Kunduzanko, in both. They are the same. Same. And Kund

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:44.940
uzanko, or the Buddha Samhinde Badra, according, Vedic teaching, is the original Buddha, the first

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.480
 Buddha.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.760
 That means, generally, in Buddhism, there are so many Buddhas, male Buddha, female Buddhas. But

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.480
 Kunduzanko reached the Buddhahood at the very beginning, very beginning times.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.480
 And many times, you say, pre-modial times.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:10.480
 Kunduzanko reached the enlightenment Buddha instantly at the beginning time, and that is known as,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.480
 this Buddha is known as past Buddha.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:22.180
 Original Buddha, past Buddha, in Sanskrit, Sanskrit called Adi Buddha, the original Buddhas. And so

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:31.480
 now, here, how Kunduzanko reached enlightenment at the beginning times?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:42.120
 And so that means, means, at the very beginning time, we and the Kunduzankos are the same. We are

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.480
 all same. That means we all have the same nature.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:54.480
 There's no different naturals. As we have everyone as nature of the mind, me, you, and everyone,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.480
 and similarly, Kunduzanko, the Buddha Samhinde Badra, had the same nature.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:08.020
 But we, sentient beings, are deluded, deluded, and the Kunduzanko, undeluded, reaching

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.480
 enlightenment.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:16.480
 How that happened? That is what they explained.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:26.490
 And this is now, here, I said, this nature, so here, so this is the Paramore icon of the programs.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.480
 Then we moved to the page 3, and here I said,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:40.880
 The nature of the source of the, of the free from the cause and conditions. Nature, the nature of

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.480
 the source is free from the cause and conditions.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:54.480
 This nature is what? Again, same thing, going back to the nature of the mind.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.160
 The nature of the mind is free from the cause and conditions. That explained at the beginning time,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.480
 here, too.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:10.450
 We said it's uncompounded, self-arising, same thing, so it's just we went before. So it's free from

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.480
 cause and conditions.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:23.540
 And that nature, if you realize this nature, nature, then you get enlightenment. If you didn't

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.480
 realize it, then we are deluded.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.480
 So therefore, Kunduzanko, the Buddha Samhinde Badra, immediately recognized that.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:39.170
 And that is how, it's happened again, I've told every moment, that in the teaching set, at the very

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.480
 beginning time, beginning time, I mean, nature is the same.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.480
 We all have the equal nature. There's not any difference at all.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:59.420
 But since nature is free from the cause and conditions, but it has all the energies, nature has all

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:05.480
 the energies, again talking, nature of the mind, has all the energies.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:12.480
 That's what it's called, because of that energy is self-arising. Self-arising display comes.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:21.480
 This self-nature, in the Dzogchen teaching set, this nature, it's surely the nature of the mind,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.480
 inherent, natural inherent, the enlightenment.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.140
 It's enlightened, I mean, already. What the enlightened call it is, are known as three kayas, or

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.480
 three Vastams.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 Vastams of the Dharmakaya, Vastams of the Sambokaya, Vastams of the Nirmakaya.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:47.480
 These three potentials are residing simultaneously with your and the mind, the nature of the mind,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.480
 as well as for the Samhinde Badra too.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:58.020
 So, what is now, as I talk now, these three kayas, again, as I talk more about the simple way, what

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.480
 is Dharmakaya of the mind, of the nature of the mind?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.010
 When you look to the nature of the mind, have you looked to our own, have you tried to read our

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.480
 mind, your mind?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:20.170
 Every say, "Where is your mind?" or "My mind?" Have you tried to search your mind? Mind? You can't

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.480
 find anything.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.460
 You can't find anything. That is known as in Buddhism, emptiness, many times, using terminology,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.480
 emptiness.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:41.480
 This emptiness is what that nature is open, free, total freedom, openness, vastness.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:51.480
 That nature is called Dharmakaya Vastams. So, we have Dharmakaya right now.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:19:03.480
 Now, that mind, even though we can't see anything, we can't find anything, but mind has energy,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.480
 energy.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:13.480
 Energy is radiating energy, clarity, sometimes clarity energy.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:21.970
 This clarity energy of the mind, what kind of brightness is not like peaceful object, peaceful

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.480
 furniture, or peaceful blank state.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.480
 It has some radiating energy that we can feel, see.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 That is truly known as Sambogaya mind. That is the richness.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:44.480
 Mind is not blank state, empty state. It is full of reach, as we talked before.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 All the richness, everything comes from this. That potential is right there.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:59.480
 This nature is, as I said, again, Sambogaya mind, Sambogaya Vastams.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:07.480
 Because of that open, because of nature, Dharmakaya is so open, so vastness, so empty in a way,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480
 openness,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:18.490
 and this energy is so evaporated and so is there in that, because of that combination, then there

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.480
 is arising mind.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.830
 That we can see, "Oh, this is good." "That's bad." "Oh, this is nice." All these mind, these

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.480
 thoughts are arising.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.480
 This is known as, in the Dhokriti teaching, Namagaya mind. This is Namagaya Vastams, actually.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:46.480
 This is enlightenment status. Now I see these three things, like empty, clarity, arising energy,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.480
 abruptly, comfortably, arising energy. Even there are three things.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:59.480
 I mentioned that, but in reality, they are not separated. All is in all. All is the same.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.480
 It's nothing that we can divide three pieces, different objects, places. All is the same.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:16.480
 That is known as union of trikayas, inseparably. Inseparable union. This is our nature of the mind,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:23.300
 your nature of the mind. Because of that, we can get enlightenment. We can reach, become the Buddha

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:23.480
.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:31.480
 We can make the change. All comes from us, and we can make the change as we want, as we need.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.480
 It could say sometimes, but it will make. No, it's true, it could say sometimes.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:44.480
 But in Dhokriti teaching, you can change within 12 years. Really, have you put the joy forever?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.480
 We work on your Saturn. There are so many great masters who really achieve that.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:58.480
 But then it takes time sometimes, that's it. So this is called the soul, the ordinary nature.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.480
 Now, I talk to go back to the Kunduzango. When this nature arises,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.480
 natural arise, that energy is that arise, rapidly arises.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:17.480
 That happens to the Kunduzango, the Buddha, Samhana, Bhaddara, and to us happening.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.480
 When the Kunduzango, when that happens, immediately,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:29.480
 Kunduzango recognized it is on his or her own display, display.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:36.480
 He or she, this Buddha, Samhana, Bhaddara, didn't met any distractions as subject objects.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:43.480
 Didn't met for the levels. Immediately recognized its displays.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:52.480
 That moment, whole games changed, and then known as become the Buddha,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 instantly become the Buddha. That moment, he instantly become the Buddha, fully awakened.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.480
 You see, this is the own display, that as moment is arise, that moment he discovered,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.480
 or he realized his display. At that moment, everything is transcendent, changing everything,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.480
 every show or every display, and become the Buddha.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.480
 Buddha, Samhana, Bhaddara, or Kunduzango. But what we send in beings, that arises,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.480
 we didn't recognize immediately, we labeled as subject object.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:37.480
 That explains it later here too. And then we start wondering, can we, as nightmare,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.480
 for example, we made nightmare, we recognize this is our own dream,

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.480
 that will be stopped very soon, that nightmare.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.480
 We didn't recognize that, we struggle with that, nightmare goes on, on.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:00.480
 These same things. Then, that, that happens. So here, that is the, I mean,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:07.480
 I'll highlight it now, meaning that. So that, now nature of that, nature of this,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:17.480
 the source is, is, and now we go back to the page 3 again.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 In page 3, the source is realized by sub-continent arising awareness.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 Sub-continent arising, and when it arises at that, what Buddha Samhana Bhaddara did here,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:39.480
 is not named by arrows and exaggeration, and exaggeration, such as inside, outside.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:47.480
 He didn't label, or Buddha Samhana Bhaddara, she or he didn't label at all.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.480
 Immediately recognize that. It was not obscured by this here, next one.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.480
 It is not obscured by the darkness of the mindlessness.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:08.480
 This now does. Clearly see it is self display of your own nature, nature, nature.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.480
 Since, since the nature is never obscured at the beginning time, never obscured.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:23.480
 Nature, nature is fresh, pristine, and clean, unobscured, cool.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.480
 And soul is, always remain in the, in the, in the next line.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:35.480
 It's cultivated this fresh, pristine awareness. All the time it is.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 This is what the Buddha Samhana Bhaddara or the Kondu Samhana Bhaddara realized.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:47.250
 When you have these realizations, since it is realization, no matter what the external thing is

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.480
 happening, happening,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:57.480
 there is no nothing, nothing really need to be scared or afraid.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:05.480
 There is nothing kind of going, anything changes at all. It's all display. It's all display.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.480
 As in the dream, whatever course comes up, reality, nothing is happening.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.480
 It's all display of the dream. Same thing, same thing.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:23.480
 So, then we will move continually. If you remain in that pristine realization status,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.480
 then as Buddha Samhana Bhaddara reached enlightenment, then here, next page.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.480
 And then there's unattached to the private object of the sensory pleasures.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.480
 That also, you're not, since you're not attached, private sensory pleasure object is not become

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
 obstacles to you,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.480
 or the hindrance to you. For those reasons, invariant teachings,

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.480
 there is nothing to be given up, nothing to be rejected, nothing to be accepted. All is fine.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:07.140
 Everything is attached there. And what are the five object of the sensory pleasures? What are those

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.480
?

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.480
 Food.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 Yeah? Good, that's good.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480
 Wealth.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 That's it, wealth.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480
 Companionship.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 What?

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480
 Companionship.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 Companionship.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.480
 Clothes.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.480
 Clothes? Of course, true.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480
 Is it true?

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480
 One is true.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480
 One is true.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480
 Sucker.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480
 Sucker balls.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480
 Sucker balls.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480
 Sucker balls, that's the Sucker balls.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480
 God.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.480
 God in the world.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:44.480
 So, if you relax on the pristine in this natural status, then everything is great.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.480
 Everything is so fine. But this fact that your object is actually,

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.480
 also we kind of go more official in the Buddhism.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.480
 Then it is related with the five senses.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 What are five senses?

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.480
 That's it, five senses.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:12.480
 Yeah, five senses, that is the eye senses, ear senses, nose senses, tongue senses,

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.480
 and then body senses.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 And then sometimes also number six senses, mind.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480
 Mind.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.480
 But here say the five, so we stay with five.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480
 Five.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.480
 So, what are the, now, so those are senses.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.480
 Object of five senses, what are those?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.480
 Those are like, those are the pleasure objects.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 Pleasure objects.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.480
 So, eye senses, pleasure objects is beautiful forms.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.480
 No matter whatever that is, beautiful forms.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 Ear senses, object, pleasure objects, ear senses is beautiful musics,

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.480
 beautiful songs, whatever that is.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:58.480
 And then the pleasure object of the nose senses is fragrance, delicious fragrance, that is.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.480
 And object of the pleasure object of the tongue senses is then,

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:11.480
 delicious yummies, gourmet food, those all things, all these things is tongue.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:22.480
 And of course, then it eventually will be tummy too, is the yummy to the tummy.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.480
 Eventually it ended up to the yummy tummy.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.480
 And then play your object of the senses.
