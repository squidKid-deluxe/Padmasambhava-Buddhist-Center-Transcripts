00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 Thank you so much for participating. Here we are all here for effort and thank you so much.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.800
 And again we are going to continue through the teaching and as we always, or I mean not we,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:23.500
 in the teaching, see that it's activated or with the motivations and increasing or rising up our

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 motivations.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.600
 With that motivation, we're studying, we're contemplating, we're meditating or practicing.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.000
 So that's so important as a foundation. It's so important of center columns.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Also it is so important to fulfill the goal and reach on fruit of the practices.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.820
 So those are so important. We just told and that those are suggested and then the joy and the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.000
 appreciations.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And then vastness motivation of the bodhicata. Actually of all there's two bodhicata.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.550
 Absolute bodhicata and relative bodhicata. But this time we're highlighting of the vastness

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.000
 motivation of the bodhicata,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 which is relative to the bodhicata. Relative bodhicata is, then of course, we all know,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 is vast union of the compassion and the vastness. And what the teaching said,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 compassion is projected into all the beings. Seeing the situation and the circumstances

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 and challenges every living being is going through or going through that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.470
 And so really strong compassion and a very sensible, strong compassion, like to help to all

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.000
 sentient beings.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 But even though we like to help and support that, we don't have the capabilities to help and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 supporting.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 We are like this in the teaching always. We're like kind of like handcuffed mother.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The hair, dear child is losing in the river. When high chair is losing in the water or river and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 handcuffed mother can't do anything.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 She feels so strongly like to do something, but we don't have any capabilities.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 So that for that reason to kind of get wise ourself and then like to get enlightenment.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 To do the enlightenment, to remove the old obscurations of ourself.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Projecting like to help to all beings. That I like to remove all the obscurations, obstacles.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And that's why I can get enlightenment can benefit for all sentient beings.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 With pervasive continuation and spontaneously I'm going to benefit for all living beings.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 I mean that attitude, the intention, all strongly and rooted up there.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And that is an honor related to bodhicata. Of course, we all know this.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Relate to bodhicata. Relate to bodhicata is.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Then practice like waking bodhicata is a practice by the poor, boundless practice.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Again, we all know this.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And when we are kind of activating bodhicata in those great masters, always say the word.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Say that kind of equalize us.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 All the sentient beings ourselves are equal.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 We are all equal. Same way.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 All, every aspect we are really equal.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So bring more equal, equal limited attitude in the heart and mind.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And what is that?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Actually when you put the practices.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Practices among the poor, boundless.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 The poor, boundless.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 May all living beings are free from the attachments to the close ones, rejection to the others.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Others, that is economic practice.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 But economically we are all equal.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 We are all the same.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Same. The sameness attitude is so important in the teaching set.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Because our ego claiming always we feel important with the first.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 First and all the others are seconds.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 We've been doing that from the biggest times according to the teaching.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 But now we are really reversing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Genuine compassion in the heart and mind.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 We are all equal.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Those are in the practice teachings in bodhicata what called.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Cause we equalize, equal.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 All we equal. We all bring up equal.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 We like happiness.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Everybody likes happiness.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 We like peace.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Everybody likes peace.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 We like not get suffering.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Or we don't like suffering.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Everybody don't like suffering.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 So our feelings level and technical desire.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And then where we are.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And we share the common ground of this world.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 And every level we are equal.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And that part is the equanimity.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Many times in the teaching set according literature, the poor bornless are listed as first love.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Then second bornless love.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Bornless, completely second.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And third is bornless joy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Joy in the fourth is equanimity.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 But when we put it in practice, always in the teaching mentioned.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Many greatest marks may both bring more attitude of the equalized thought.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Intention.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 When we are more kind of equally taught.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Then compassion.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And loving kindness comes more easily in the teaching set.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Those are practices.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Practices like instructions.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Practical is kind of like their spirit or their instructions.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So then we really will have love.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And then joy all comes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And then second is.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But in the practices what in the teaching set.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Then the others are more important than the one's own self.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 One's own self.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 First equal.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Second, others are more important than us.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 That means that our ego cling is going down.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Self-importance went down.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Instead of all our habit pattern, we are more important.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Our self, according habit pattern.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But now we are reversing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Reversing that.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And that never happened in the history of our birth, according to the teaching.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Until we meet the teaching of the Buddha.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Others are more important than us.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 So we reverse that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Before that, we are more important than others.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Now we reverse.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Others are more important than us.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 With this thought.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And then this thought born less.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 May all living with happiness and cause happiness.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Have that recited.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Like coming back and all according to the teaching.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Again, great master.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Relax and say that.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Then taking that all our joy and our happiness and everything.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 I share with everyone to make happy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 All that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Really with that thought.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 May all living with that happiness.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Cause of happiness.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Sincerely thinking.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 The others are more important with that attitude.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And sharing our joy and peace, happiness.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Our marriage always.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 All the marriage that all goes to them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So they have forever joy and peace, happiness.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And then jhans suggest.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 May all living with that.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Free from sufferings.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Cause of sufferings.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Jhans that and all their suffering.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 The difficult troubles.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Are you bringing in.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 To yourself.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 In.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 So no more sufferings.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 No more difficult.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Challenge the left.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 To anyone outside.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And join the praise of.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 This poem called boneless praise.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Boneless compassion.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Compassion is.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Particularly projected for the different.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Troubles of this living.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 All the sentient beings.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So may all living beings are.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Free from sufferings.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And cause of sufferings.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Not just suffering.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 But cause of sufferings.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And that is what in the Buddha teaching.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Suffering truth.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Cause of suffering truth.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Pwn over truth.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Pwn to truth.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 We are completely uprooting.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 May all living beings are free from suffering.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Suffering is.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Suffering truth.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Difficulty troubles all sentient beings.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 That go through.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And cause of suffering.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Cause of suffering truth.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 So samsara cause.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And samsara resolve.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 If they are gone.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Samsara is gone.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 If there is no cause of suffering.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 There is no cause of suffering.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Then there is no suffering.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And samsara is gone.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Eliminated.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 So that uprooting that with that attitude.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Poor intention but strongly in heart and mind.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And giant.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 May all living beings are free from suffering.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Cause of suffering.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And we find that even put in the teaching say.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Even for one minute or one second.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Whatever it takes time to giant that great.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And sincerely thinking that in heart.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Really thinking.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 It is so powerful.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 To remove obscurations.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Our obstacles.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Our troubles.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And gain man.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Man.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So powerful.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 I mean we and also in the teaching said.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 We need the life sort of those.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Great teaching Buddha.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 When you are supposed to.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Reaching enlightenment.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Working for the enlightenment.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And how many times.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 I mean even Buddha.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 In the teaching said.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 If he had attitude toward of the in.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 When he was born in Hellerems.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Hellerems.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And he and his friends are pulling.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 The iron chariot.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 The border.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And others are so weak.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Can't pull.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 But.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 But those agents of the Hellerems are beating him.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And Buddha feels so compassion.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Compassion.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 But he don't have.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Stand up.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Why are they beating him?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And I'm going.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 May.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 I'm going to tell you.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 That whole thing is myself.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 I will tell you over there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 In his positions.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 That is in the teaching said.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Big enough of his body.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 But also that is.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Eco light.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 People are both are eco.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And he can't even up his.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 He himself.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 To the front runner.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 So he changed.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Attitude.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 That moment in the teaching said.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Because of that put it by the other obstacles.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Obscuration.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And karma to be born in that places.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And then he changed.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 How powerful is.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 For the particular.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 So good.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Body.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Thinking of this.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 This truly sincerely.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 In the heart.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Is so powerful in the teaching.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 They say.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So powerful.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 It heals.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 The all the emotions.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Put it by the negativity.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Accumulate the merits.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Instant.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 That is.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Eco light this.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And then this is again.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 I see.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 It's just the beginning of the body.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Get.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Before we say.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Always.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 We are self important.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Energy.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And now.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 We are.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Changing that positions.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Because it's more important.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 With that.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Then.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Same way.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Same way.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 They all living with have.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Have always happiness.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Call of happiness.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 That means.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 We are happy.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 We wish.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 We.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 They are always happy.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Because we are praying.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 How we can count.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 All your joy.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 And your activity.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 My activity.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Your practices.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Or now they become more happy.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And the joy.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 I am so happy.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Fulfilling the goal.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Of the waking of the body.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 That is.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So powerful attitude.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 It's free from.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Jealousness.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Jealousness.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 And also it's so pure.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Pure waking that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 It's so powerful in the teaching.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Say.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Say.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Even one core intention of that tool.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 It was hungry bird.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Ourself.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 In heaven.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And glorified bird.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 To the lower ends.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Or the cause to bird.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Lower ends.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 That moment.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 So.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Those are already known as.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Bodhicata.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And which is.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Relate to bodhicata.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Relate to bodhicata.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Is.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 The foundation of our practices.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Always say.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 The teaching.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 If we have the bodhicata.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Then we do the doki practice.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Absolute to bodhicata.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Then it becomes so powerful.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 But if we don't have the relate to bodhicata.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 And the practice of doki.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 That's absolute to bodhicata.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 It's kind of almost like.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Not exactly making up.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It's not really completely.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 100% full.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 It's like 50.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 50 or 6% full.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 But.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 40% or 60%.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 It's like.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 It's out.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 So they have the full bloom of the documentary.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 The practice.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Is really.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Bodhicata.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Is so important.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Of course.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 We all heard this so many times.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 We know already.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 But also is always important.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Reminder to each other.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 So that we can strengthen.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Meetings of the heavy habit patterns.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Of the emotions.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Raging every direction.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 And they are really like.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 As in the teaching.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 As in we are in the jaw of the emotions.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Ourself.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 We are always in the jaw of the.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Any moment.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Any those jaw can bite us.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Anger.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Yellows.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Hated thoughts.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Attachment.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 That can really bite us.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So strong with them.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And then we again.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Become victims of the emotion.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Instead we are releasing a defeat.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And the negative emotions.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Become the victim.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So therefore.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 To reminding.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Refreshing the memory.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And re-strengthen of this.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 As the known as.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Part of the practices.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 That is how we practice.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 With this thought.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And then.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Again of course.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 The motivation.
