00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 Gongh. Because it really means the practice is going on, all starting on the counter-pellation

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.200
 is going on. That means upholding the teaching of the Buddha. So it's very special. And then

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.280
 the teaching is also dedicated to bringing joy and peace, harmony to all living beings, and then

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.200
 finally, uprooting everyone's ignorance, attachment, anger. Those are the really reasons

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.280
 that we're ringing the gongh. So in the teaching, you can meditate. Think of this. When you're

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.720
 ringing the gongh, think of that. You're called to calling every disciple of the greatest teacher,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 Buddha Shakyamuni. Come here. Now we are going to expound. Teaching, or practicing the teaching,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:04.400
 join with us, target those who like to do. There is a teaching, one verse said,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 "Whoever you are, throw out three times, three thousand-fold universe, wherever the disciples

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.640
 of the greatest teacher, if you'd like to participate through these practices or starting

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.080
 counter-pellation things, please come now and join with us right now." So that is really the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.560
 indication of this, the ringing of the gongh. And also in the teaching said, when the Buddha

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.970
 enters the Mahāprāri nirvana at that moment, or right soon, the Buddha enters the Mahāprāri nir

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.480
vana,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.720
 then they get the post-gathering, post-congregation and big gathering to kind of collecting,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.680
 gathering all the Buddha teachings that next year. Just before that, they ring the gongh. It's not

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.560
 exactly gongh. In Buddhism, they have many kind of different gonghs or different instrumentals.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.440
 One is a stake, a long stake, kind of almost like this side, and then you hold up here and then

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 there's another stake that you beat that gongh, that stake, slowly and slowly. And there is one

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 great Arhada, who is meditating on the mountain slops of the mountain Sumeru, and he heard that

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.520
 sound. What is this is? It is like kind of untimely, untimely making this, or unusual,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.680
 usually making this gongh ringing. What is this? And then through his meditation, he realized

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.320
 Buddha has entered already Mahāprāri nirvana. So then, for that reason, Sangha is calling

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.880
 everyone

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:05.920
 to come join and to recollect all his teachings. So then, also immediately, he came. So this is one

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 of the kind of examples of that. And then also in the teachings, when you ring the gongh,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.000
 and generally gongh symbolize also in some teachings, not some, quite a few teachings

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.670
 mentioned, this gongh is symbolized as a Pāṇḍyapāramata. Pāṇḍyapāramata, when you ring

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 the gongh,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.160
 that is sound of emptiness, sound of emptiness. So really, you're ringing. And also, the way the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.880
 sound is coming, this is the great teacher, the Buddha Shājāma, gives the teachings on the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.960
 interdependent connection or interdependent coordination. We say it is sound of the gongh.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.400
 Every sound of gongh is the principle, but sound that's not just coming from, only from the gongh.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.640
 If there is no that mistake, it won't come. If there is no individual heartbeat, it won't come.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.240
 If there is no standing of that, that is not going to come. So that sound is coming from the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.800
 stake, that sound is coming from the gongh, or sound is coming from the individual, where it is.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.040
 It's a combination of all. That's just immediately. There are so many factors.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.120
 All young children, they met that sound. So this is sound of the emptiness, sound of the peace,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.400
 sound of harmonics, sound of the waking up, sound of the dispelling, the ignorance.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.040
 So there is that really thought. And then when he rang the gongh, he made this rang the gongh,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.280
 and up, lifting, and the light, and the teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shājāma,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.400
 that made a very long teaching, lasted a long time, made it become the cause to bring the joy

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.080
 and the peace, happiness for all living beings. And all those beautiful motivations and intentions,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.160
 we should rank that. Those are the teachings mentioned in that. So then also see this is the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.520
 emptiness, sound of emptiness, sound of the Pandya Paramata. As we joined 21 less words

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.560
 that pointed out the teaching by Gaurabhema Sambha. The sound of emptiness is the sound of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.000
 a tourist one as we joined. So this is really like as like immediately pointing out of the sound

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.160
 emptiness. And then not just the everything is like that kind of that similar situation, similar

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:46.480
 status. So those are the kind of story and related with the gongh. Okay, so thank you.
