00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 "How much attachment we have, how much anger we have, how much kanwale self-important attitude

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:16.060
 toward we have, and all that things, the anger all that is enormous. Really, this is leading

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 to our self, to my self, self even talking. We have to improve our self, and that is what

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.580
 the teaching always said, to improve our self, that we all need, everyone. We know intellectually

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.060
 a bit, but now we have to observe that in the heart and mind and for the inner session.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.180
 I want to really try to cultivate as much as we can. And with that, in the body, then

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.220
 the Hindu practices. Once the Hindu practices and do, then at the end of the Guru Yoga practices,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 then Dzokhi meditation, Tukku meditation, and Togga meditation. Tukku meditation is,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.660
 you all know, I mean, we've heard so many times, is a foundation. We don't have the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.260
 good ground of the Tukku meditation, good realization of the Tukku meditation. Our Togga

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:24.060
 practice, we want to tell the goal, what we want. Why? Because Tukku is cutting total.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:37.460
 That's the way to work. What is cutting total? Attachment, grasping, clean is cutting total.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.180
 And Togga is discovering the vision, discovering the call, reaching the call of the nature

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.660
 of the mind. When we don't have the Tukku meditation of cutting total or cutting total

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:03.060
 grasping, our Togga practice, we can grasp it, we can cling it. If we cling it, grasp

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.660
 it with Togga, then that cling is clinging in the teachings. It's clinging, it's attachment.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.060
 Clinging is duality. So even we are having some visions of the Togga practice, but we

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 start clinging. Then we are going to come and cling it from the cling. We cannot try

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.660
 to avoid or nibble the cling of the regular world things, but they were grasping, clinging

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.460
 to the Togga visions. Then it's just really kind of like you just going from one right

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:53.660
 to the left. We never went able to go to the middle beyond the duality, beyond the cling.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:04.260
 So therefore, Togga practice is really, the achievement of Togga practice is, is dependent

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.860
 of the Tukku practice. And therefore, in the mornings, or always, always do Tukku practice

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:25.660
 more strong, as much as you can, to do it so really so long.
