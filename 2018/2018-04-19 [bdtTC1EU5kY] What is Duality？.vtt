00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 But duality is, in the teaching said, as long as you have the notion of the subject, object, and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900
 activity, that is duality.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 That means any form of grasping, any form of grasping, that is what the teaching said.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 For example, this time when we are practicing in the beginning time, we have to sort it out, like

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.800
 we have to choose.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.550
 We choose good grasping and bad grasping, and we should not have bad grasping, we should have good

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 grasping.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 Good grasping, such as practicing, meditating, bodhicata is good, devotional, as we are talking,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 all this is good.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.200
 But this good grasping will help to remove the unhealthy, unbeneficial graspings.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 So now we become stronger and stronger, all those good graspings, then that also we are merging

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 those good graspings.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 We are where that is coming from. All this good grasping is coming from.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 It is coming from the emptiness of mind.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.890
 So where is the emptiness of mind? There is nothing that we can hold, nothing we can say anything

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.600
 about.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.390
 And then, beyond any existing, even we are not just kind of grasping beyond the existing, every

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.600
 grasping.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.880
 That is what the gracious teacher Buddha mentioned, going beyond everything, beyond existing, non-

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.600
existing, neither in either.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.500
 This is not just kind of old games that we are playing, but uprooting every corner of the grasping.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 Any form, every grasping, oh there is no grasping, that is grasping, ultimate level.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 And that, even in the teachings, even the devotions, the ultimate belief, we release it.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:21.400
 Devotions, we release. That also let go. But that will naturally go, because when we are increasing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 the realization of the nature or the tutu, exactly,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.400
 as it is, its natural will then become softer and softer, not so strong and a hard regiment.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 So that is really the teaching said, and so, I mean, that is what I am saying.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.500
 >> It's good to see that it helps a lot, thank you.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.000
 >> Yes.
