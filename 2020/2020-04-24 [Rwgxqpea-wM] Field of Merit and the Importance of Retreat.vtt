00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone. Again, we are going to address

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.880
 the strengthening or the accurately our motivation of the positive motivation or virtuous

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.560
 motivation.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.080
 Even which started with joy and appreciation, grateful or thankful, or gratitude. And then

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.000
 vastness, motivation of the both each other, taking of all living beings, may they remove

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.360
 from the suffering, cause of sufferings, may they always have joy, happiness, cause of joy

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.560
 and happiness. And they may remain in economy all the time, or have great balance, understanding,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.040
 openness, that is, enriching those thoughts, which is again summarized or clearly made in

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 our boneless thoughts. Strongly and openly, kind of, genuinely raise up from our heart,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.400
 and we see that really mean that to every living beings. And then same time, also this universe

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:34.320
 inhabited all in a three radial status, radial form, radial sound, and radial mind status.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:45.040
 Those are the reality nature of the way this universe inhabits, are according the teaching

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.880
 of the Buddha, rid of the sambhava, or the great masters. So we activate those international

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.680
 thought in our heart, and that is really to begin the practices, meditation or reflecting

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.080
 on the teachings. Those are always important at the very beginning, and is also according teaching,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.120
 and we can hear throughout the teaching, throughout the practices. At the end, also we can delegate

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.320
 the merit with those intentions. And then we kind of completed that practice period, but when we

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.480
 are

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.840
 in the world, also occasionally remembering, thinking of those is really very important.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.800
 We are touching to our home and sweet home, or we are touching back to our own best, which is so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.240
 practical and beautiful. And with those intentions, now again I'll go back to the teaching,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.800
 what we are continually going on, by all teachings of the best. What I'm teaching is the best

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.200
 upon teaching by Jyadji, the new moochis. And we are talking about the three types of rafuts,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:15.120
 to the Buddha, Dharma, sambha. Then I also explained yesterday, the field of rafuts,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 or in other words, field of merit. Field of merit in a debate is called tsoyen, yambi tsoyen.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:39.680
 The rafuts, taking rafu, or taking rafuts to the field of merit. F-E-I-L-D, I believe,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.600
 field, field of merit. So that means this, when we realize, when we feel the presence of this

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.160
 rafut tree, commonly named as a rafut tree in the English, that is really a focal point,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.920
 and focal spot to activate our merits. Merits are important in order to reach enlightenment,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.640
 because that's the way it will also purify all the obscurations, hindrance of the enlightenment,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.200
 and our well-being of the realizations. So it is so important. So therefore then, as in the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.000
 teaching

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.920
 I mentioned yesterday, there is nothing much to say about that. But I'd just like to highlight

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:43.040
 that that rafut tree, or the field of merit, or the tsoyen, that encompasses three jewels

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:53.770
 and three roots. And three jewels, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and three roots are, the root of

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.720
 blessing

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:04.640
 is guru, and the root of blessing is yadam, or the deity. The root of fulfillment of the activity

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:15.440
 is dakini and dharmapalas. So that, what rafut tree has all of that. And if I highlight that again,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:25.760
 and Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And first we think, Buddha, what is Buddha there? Who is Buddha there?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:35.280
 Guru Pima sambhava is actually embodiment of all those three. Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.520
 devadakinis. Guru Pima sambhava is also known as sometimes named as one who embodies all the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:52.960
 obvious rafut. So even one Guru Pima sambhava, when we realize meditating on that, that alone

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:04.240
 encompasses entirely all those field of merit. Then beside that, again, there is a representative

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.320
 of

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:15.040
 all those three jewels. Right on the right side of the Guru Pima sambhava, I said yesterday,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:28.240
 at tree that has at trunks, so not soryam, sorry, for five trunks, center trunk, that is Guru Pima

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.000
 sambhava, sambhava, and all the lineage master lined up in the sky above Guru Pima sambhava,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.720
 that is center trunk. In the right side of Guru Pima sambhava, that has all the Buddha, right side

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:54.160
 trunk, that has all the Buddhas of one thousand Buddhas of these fourteen years. That means past

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:03.840
 Buddha, present Buddha, and future Buddhas. So that is all Buddhas. So taking rafut in the Buddha,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.480
 that all the Buddhas right there. And then very side of the Guru Pima sambhava on the trunk,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.360
 again, back trunk. So that we, if we go from the center trunk is the Guru Pima sambhava, and the

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.280
 right side of the Guru Pima sambhava is all the Buddhas on the trunk of that. Again, big beautiful

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.320
 global lot of Buddhas and all that, on the old Buddhas city. And the back trunk, or back side of

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.160
 the trunk, beautiful lot of, again, beautiful sun and moon, all that. And there is then all the d

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.640
harmas

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.480
 and all the dharmas of nayana teachings. All the eighty-four thousand teachings,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:57.120
 all the doctorate teachings. All are right there in the shimmering rainbow light with the sound

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:05.600
 of the words and consonant, or the sound of each of those teachings. Very light, very activating

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 with light in the billions of light. And that is that. So that is dharma. So I take rafut in the

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.960
 Buddha, I take rafut in the dharma. So that is all dharmas there. Dharmati possessed. And then

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.320
 on the left side of the throne of the Guru Pima sambhava, there again beautiful lot of

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.560
 full and big jagini. And there is also beautiful throne of the sun and lot of the moon raskas.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:45.920
 And there is all the Sangha members. Sangha members of the Mahayana and the Sangha members

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.840
 of the Theravadas. Sangha members of the Mahayana are led by the egg-boding sattvas,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:01.600
 such as Mejishi, our local jhora, veggie pani, and then all the egg-bodies. Those are not going to

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.280
 exist. And all that you can find out. Those are inside nimkal, kundal-zamal, dharma-nampal cell,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.240
 and material material material. The material is also one of the egg-boding sattvas. All that there.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:26.080
 And plus, all the body sattvas, all the massive bits of all the body sattvas. And then, all the

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:33.680
 ahadas and Theravada sambhava, or the gendry Buddhist sambhava members, such as lead guide,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:44.420
 shari-puttara, mongol-puttara, maka-shappa, anand, nirang-upalis, and so forth. All those like

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:44.960
 great

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:53.200
 ahadas and fewer ahadas. All those are right there. So, that is really the old Sangha members.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.880
 So, that means we take rafuddhi in the Buddha, we take rafuddhi in the dharma, we take rafuddhi,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:12.240
 you know, in all the Sangha members, represent the symbol of that all in that filled of merits,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:20.880
 all there. So, that is the Buddha dharma-sambhava. Then, guru deva dakinis, three rules.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.960
 Again, and gurupya-masambhava is, again, represented, embodiment of all the gurus,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:36.880
 as I said earlier, and you all know that. And then, upon gurupya-masambhava, on the sky,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:45.760
 in the rainbow light, all the gurus of the three lineages in the nimma schools,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:54.480
 such as mind-to-mind transmission lineage, all the gurus of the mind-to-mind transmission lineages,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:04.000
 gurus of all the symbolic transmission lineages, gurus of all the oral transmission lineages,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:13.680
 and all assemblage tell, gurus of the whole, very gurus of the indias, all gurus of the,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.440
 all the Vedas, all the gurus, past the teachers of the Buddhists, those are highlighted that,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:30.000
 but only right in there. So, that is, I tell, rafuddhi in the gurus. That is what really

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.160
 all that represented. Then, yanas, where they represented the yanas, right in front of the

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:48.560
 gurupya-masambhava, again, there is a beautiful throne, throne, again, a beautiful floor,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:58.560
 beautiful sun and moon, also respected, respectively, respectively, of the idhi of

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:09.040
 those deities, sitting on their own thrones, lord, sun, and moon baskets, and such as Vedic

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:20.320
 laryas, high end gurus, yami takas, or adherukas, and as well as peaceful buddhas. All the buddhas,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:31.120
 peaceful buddhas are right there, and left side, again, right side is all peaceful buddhas,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:42.080
 left side of the deities, all the dakinis, such as Vedivarayas, line-passed dakinis,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:50.800
 and Vedayuginis, and as well as the kandramasana, or secret Muslim dakinis, and so forth,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:00.400
 all are decided right there, all this creative blessfulness on kandru yintex, and all those

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:09.440
 dakinis are sitting right there, and then in front row of the idhams, all the dharmapalas,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:21.440
 such as Ekachati, Rahaula, Duryalipa, and Mahakalas, and all those dharmapalas there,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.160
 again, respectively, on their thrones, in each of them, even though this is like one kind of

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.880
 tree, and it's over there where you like, but it is all vastness, it's not crowded, or it's made,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:42.000
 it just distinctively see clearly, openly, that beside everyone, each of them in their

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.640
 own pure levels, their own pure level, their own rational step, so it's not something that

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.290
 conception level, can't we make that those things, and it's tree that, but reality is just

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.800
 completely

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:01.920
 open, the universe is transformed as the multiple pure land of those each of us,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.600
 enlightened beings, that we open the wondrous joy of the enlightenment qualities,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:14.960
 quality of the realizations, and that is the beauty of the Vedaya dakinis,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:22.960
 we are opening that, we're not closed, shrank, limited, these and that things, vastness, purity

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:31.760
 of all the enlightened beings, a period right in front of our eyes, to activate our realization,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.840
 our potentials, bring up to that qualities, as all that enlightenment, so that is really the

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.880
 wonder, what these refuge trees, no, commonly in the western translated, refuge trees,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:55.840
 in a debate, it's called the Jambu Choyen, Jambu Choyen is filled of merits, filled of

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:03.920
 merits, and the merits are, again, of course we could, I will show those later or the next time,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:12.720
 but true merits, accumulation merit, western merits, those are true merits, so this through this,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:22.080
 we can accumulate in the merit, activate that merit in power and qualities, and declare with

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:34.000
 obscurations, negativities, habit patterns, so that we will be totally freedom, as from the duality

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.880
 world, world of the grasping and clingy and the chaos things, with total freedom, as the celestial

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:51.120
 bird, known as Garuda, Oranghula, Shatamali, Marapema, Sambamma, all those enlightened beings,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:58.880
 their total freedom, freedoms, in the area, where there in your freedom, then you completely,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.920
 everything in that, that beauty, this is, we don't have to struggle with hugs and fears,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.400
 all the time, and I'm kind of wondering what that trick, narrow corners, bouncing back and forth,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:20.400
 clashing each other's, always, but most of the time in the samsara, we get more fear than hugs,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:31.600
 that's really how we do, because of our joys, because of our obscurations, according to teachings

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:39.600
 of the gracious teacher, Prasad Shatamali. So that is really about the rafuj trees,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:47.200
 once you talk rafujis, then there is, in stockings, in stockings, what things we should do,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.440
 and what things we should avoid, avoid. And when you tell rafujis, then always remember

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:04.160
 Buddha Dharma Sangha, or Guru Deva Dakini's, that, and always do I try to do good,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:14.000
 beneficial activities, beneficial activities to my one's own self, to others directly, indirectly,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.600
 with mind from us. And remember, as I said yesterday, or the day before yesterday,

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:28.640
 the cause of taking rafujis in the Mahayana, principally, is compassion. So it's not just

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.680
 only, oh, I like to escape from samsara, therefore I'm taking rafujis, but in the Mahayana,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:43.680
 to attitude, I like to help to all these living beings, therefore I'm going to take rafujis.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.680
 Therefore, I like to go under the blessings of the Buddha Dharma Sangha, make myself strong,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:18:00.720
 so that I can benefit continually, unceasingly, for all living beings. That is the primary wishes

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.870
 and primary determinations in the heart and mind of the practitioners of the Mahayana. So therefore

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.160
,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.560
 also when you take rafujis, or after you talk rafujis, always think of the old other beings,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:24.960
 how I can help, how I can benefit it, I'm not going to hurt them, and not going to kind of do

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.960
 naked activities, because of my principles of the, as practitioners of the Mahayana,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:41.600
 or the total rafujis. Those are in the teachings. So there are general instructions of what things

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.960
 to do, what things to avoid, those are all clearly mentioned in the words of my perfect teacher,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.520
 and other books that translate into reading, so I won't go over those things. But again,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.760
 with mindfully do the activity, something is good for the others, good for one's own self,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:11.360
 directly, indirectly. That is what we have to do with the good heart, with the compassion.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:20.400
 Good heart means a compassion, deep down is a compassion. And that compassion is the seed

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.920
 of the Buddha. That is the energy of the Buddha Shakyamuni in the Gopin Masambha, or that is the

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:38.080
 energy of the enlightenment, enlightenment means. And so, with that intention, trying to do that

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:45.680
 activity with the assistance of one's own, most important friend, the mindfulness.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:54.640
 Mindfulness is our friend. Each of us, every activated our mindfulness, that is really the

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:03.920
 best friend. So, get support from our mindfulness, always reminding ourselves to do the good things

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.800
 as much as we can do. And when you can do, when you did that, or when you're doing, when you did,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:18.880
 you should feel happy. You should rejoice. You should acknowledge your own self. I did good.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:27.440
 Feel happy. This is not arrogance. This is not kind of pride, arrogance, but should happy, joy.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:36.720
 Inspire our self is so important. Of course, people can't say, "Oh, that person is inspired,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.160
 which is good, somebody inspired you, that is good." But to inspire one's own self is the most

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:54.240
 powerful. Inspire our self, acknowledge that I did good. And in the same time, set forward the plan

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.240
,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:02.800
 plan the determination, "I will do, we, I will do even better next time." By the blessings of the

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:12.880
 three of you and the three of you. Really, we can pray that I will do better. That's how we always

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:24.560
 elevating our self and advancing. Advancing the path, that is. At the same time, if some of the

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:32.650
 negative activities that happened, that directly hurt me to others or my own self, or also

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.680
 indirectly,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:43.520
 try to avoid it. Immediately, that is detected by the mindfulness. And don't go that far,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:52.640
 try to not go that far. The moment we detect it, we try to release it, then stop. And it's all

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:59.840
 the kind of thing, "Oh, oh, I did something kind of funny things that against it with my principle

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.240
 after raffledges." Raffledges? So I'm not going to do it. By blessings of the Buddha,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:14.480
 Gharipema Samba, all the enlightenments, may I can tune easily from those happy patterns,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.520
 on wholesome, any kind of activities. Thinking of that, again, reset the commitment.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:32.880
 Courage. We do those. Those are known as practicing the Dharma. Practices. And again, we all know

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.200
 that.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:42.800
 We remember that. It's very popular thing in this country. Practice makes perfect. Practice makes

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:53.600
 perfect. That's how we do practices. Reminder to my own self. Reminding my own self is the best

00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:01.840
 reminder. If somebody else is reminded to ask that, most of the time it's very annoying.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:11.360
 It's very sensitive. We don't feel really comfortable. And maybe it will really react.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:20.320
 We react like he or she is always doing something. Always passing me. Always kind of making all

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.640
 these

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:28.400
 comments. What's that is? We will react. It's just if we want to observe, even it's really true.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:35.760
 When you accept. When you don't accept, when you react, even it's true. Then it just goes on the

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:43.770
 complete opposite direction. Reminding by our self. One's own self. It's beautiful. It's more

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.320
 effective.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:52.720
 More powerful. That's really what all these great master's practitioners really did.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:24:00.880
 So that is really what I just talked about generally. And again, in the words of my

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.800
 perfect teacher and some of those great books which translated, there's more struggles then.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.800
 So you can see and look those things. Read that more and then. And then basically what I said,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:19.360
 that is a summarizing essence of that. Then I'd like to talk a little bit about retreat.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:27.920
 Big time, we're doing retreat. Our retreat is a situation, circumstances, a complete family.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:37.600
 Put us on this retreat that we all know. We all know. And for Buddhism, retreat is very powerful.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:48.240
 That is the highway of all those ancient masters. And also now, it's not just a once upon a time,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:56.240
 it happened, retreat, and that kind of million stories. It's very active, very active. It's

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:09.440
 life, total life. Retreat is very, very powerful. Why? Because we like to change our understanding

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:19.440
 of these samsaras. We like to really make the meaning of this very precious life. This life.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:27.920
 This precious life and this life, how long we will be here. What that always in Buddhism highlight

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:36.320
 though, which is true. We're not going to be here for years. We are here for a short time.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:45.760
 Short time. In that short time period, maybe you already spent half of that or maybe even more

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:56.000
 than half we already knew our life is finished. There is only how much left. So now in that short

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.720
 period of time, whatever my life is, I really like to make some changes. My understanding of this

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:16.000
 role and then make something progress. Where that progress? Not the external material world, but I

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.760
 like to do something that progress within my mental state, mind. I like to develop something,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:35.680
 mind status. According to Buddhism, mind will go up with us from place to place. That means

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:43.520
 from life to life. All the material things, whatever we have, we will leave behind.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:54.560
 Our mind is only welcome with us when we leave. According to Buddhism, as we all know, we believe

00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:04.240
 regret. We believe reincarnations. And now here we are here, we are incarnated of our previous

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.880
 lives.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:13.360
 Now we are here. And we will be continuing like that for a long time. So when we reincarnate,

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:22.240
 what really we cook is our mind or not about consciousness. According to the teaching,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.360
 whatever we developed with mind, that will come with us.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:39.280
 Come us. Whether it is good, whether it is bad, that will pull. Good is known as in Buddhism,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:49.120
 good comes and bad is known as bad comes. It will come. It will come as a shadow, according to it.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.960
 So therefore, I like to change the direction and like to have more kind of good comes.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:04.880
 That means more positive energy, more positive things in my mind. Therefore, I will do the retreat.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:17.760
 So retreat is solely dedicated to progress our inner qualities, inner qualities of the mind.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.840
 Improve the mind. What means improve the mind? When we do the retreat according to Buddhism,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:34.720
 it will bring more joy, more appreciation, more grateful, more loving kindness,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:43.600
 more compassion, more openness minds, openness minds, more freedom minds.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:52.080
 And then when that happens, our inner, the capabilities, our inner potentials,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:01.840
 our inner creativities and beautiful creativities, all that flows, calm, beautiful.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.920
 So that's what reason we do retreat. That's the principle. What means retreat?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.840
 Retreat is asked of course in the old, but in Tibetan it's some. So it's translated as

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:21.440
 retreat, I believe. And retreat, according to the Tibetan word meaning some,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:31.120
 means I'm retreating from all the busy activities, busy activities of the mundane world.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:40.480
 What that is, what those are, it's called mundane busy activities of the physical,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:49.760
 mundane busy activities of the verbal of the speech and verbal of mundane busy activities

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.960
 of the mental. So that I like to be kind of retreating from all those activities.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:06.160
 And for that reason, what is the teaching you see? Outer retreats, inner retreats,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:14.720
 secret retreats. In that three kind of divisions, originally in time what we are having,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:22.880
 our situation circumstances allowing us the outer retreats, outer retreats.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:31.040
 Outer retreat is all the physical busy activities, all the social activities that really

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:40.000
 is kind of like, that it allowed us to do retreat. So now we are, we can relate retreat from social

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.440
 activities, all the physical that kind of regular ego we do, those retreats that we are

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:56.880
 doing retreat, which is wonderful and very beautiful. Now when we have that, then what

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:03.760
 they do? In ancient time Buddhism, I mean the retreat is as I said so popular in Buddhism.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.920
 And the Buddha had terminated a retreat too. Even though they don't call it exactly, they don't use

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.560
 the name or the terminology retreat, but six years in the Nalanda Bay of Narendra River,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:26.160
 Buddha did retreat six years and the offering is called ascetic retreat, ascetic retreats.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:34.720
 For six years he did retreat. And Guru Pemma Samba did retreat even though he is enlightened,

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.960
 totally as the emanation of the of the Buddha Shakyamuni or reincarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:51.760
 and the emanation of the Amitabha. He did retreat in old cemeteries. He did retreat, all those

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.160
 places.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:32:00.400
 So retreat is as I said, it's a big highway of all these great masters. We're talking about all the

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:08.320
 great masters, list the names of all those masters. Everyone did retreat, everyone did.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.840
 I don't see anyone there did not do retreat. Really, hardly, anyone there. Maybe

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:23.520
 came in that body, they did retreat. And that he called it teaching. He's so high in coverability,

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:30.640
 practitioners, high in coverability, students, moment he received the teaching and then he just

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.480
 enjoyed that king's environment and luckily standard and he reached enlightenment in the

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:44.640
 teaching system. But still he did something because he changed the situation or the perspectives

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:53.040
 of the of the king's luxury qualities. Even though he did not give up things, but he did

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:59.680
 and he reached enlightenment within that life. But almost otherwise everyone really did retreat.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:20.560
 All those great thetans of the did retreat, all those master of the Kama self did retreat,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:29.520
 Gharab Duryi did retreat, Shiri Sangha did retreat, Manju Shiri Madarit did retreat and then Baman

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:39.520
 Madarit did retreat, Vayajana did retreat. So we did retreat with this one now in this situation.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.680
 So therefore, this time we have, I'm not just joking, it's really true, everyone did

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:53.040
 Nargayana did retreat, Arahadeva did retreat and then Aswendha did retreat. All those

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:59.760
 integrated masters, everyone did retreat and really did it because when do you retreat?

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:06.640
 What did that? It will allow the situational circumstance so that we can improve our

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:14.000
 inner value or the potentials of our Balan nature. That is what really reason they do

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.880
 retreats. And when you do retreat and there's two retreats, two retreats called then regular

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:32.240
 retreat or the regular and one is called smooth retreat. Sanghopo, Sanghopo all the smooth and

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:42.800
 soft retreat or tight retreats, tight retreats and many of those great master did tight retreats.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:53.200
 And there I will talk a little story of this type, those master did retreat,

00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:02.020
 those great master did retreat. How did they reach these situations? They're sitting up in the

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:02.320
 caves

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:10.240
 most of the time. When you say all those master did retreat in the cave on the beautiful mountain

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:18.000
 and what was the wood, fresh air, beautiful panoramic woods and then also pristine and the

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.240
 mountainous and the glacial and all that. It's true, it's really beautiful. But reality ever,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.080
 we have to stay there with that situation and the glacial mountain there, the glacial mountain

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:39.840
 on the retreat in the caves. I don't know how we will do. I don't know you ask. In the cave you

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.080
 must

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:49.680
 think there is no running waters. There is no running hot waters. Don't mention hot waters.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:36:02.320
 And also there is no the pyres that you can turn the button and get a pyre. Pyre. So then and there

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:14.640
 is no airhouse. So what do you do? You don't have. Still you have to eat. Still you have to cook

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:23.920
 something. Still you have to heat up or at least boil your water. Tea. So what they do? And then

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:34.400
 to have to have water. To have to have firewood. Firewood. And to get water. Some places, even the

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:43.360
 cave where the cave there is no, not every cave has a running water nearby. Nearby. Maybe one

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:52.880
 miles. Two miles have to go get water. Water is true. It's really true. It's true. And there is

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.400
 no firewood that you can get immediately. So many. You have to go in the collected

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:07.680
 pyre woods. And up in the glacial mountain there is not an actual wood you can get. Maybe

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.960
 shrubs of the bushes, dry bushes, some you are lucky you can find. Otherwise you have to get

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:23.520
 something that can make the fire. Many times those are used domes. Different domes used.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.520
 So that means water has to be saved.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:37.760
 Get the water away and make the fire. And then you can imagine there is no heating

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.720
 systems in the cave. Or there is no cooling systems in the caves.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:53.280
 Caves. So that's really what they do. But still they do it. They are happy. They are so excited.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:02.320
 They should show freedoms. Freedoms. And they make the wind. Did you retweet? How many

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:10.000
 pyre woods? They make all the pyre woods. Divided at least four pyre woods. In the morning,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.600
 late morning, afternoon, in the evening, and maybe late evening.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:27.680
 One of the greatest teachers, the teacher said in the teaching said in early morning

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:37.600
 and late evening she would practice. And that means the whole day. In early morning,

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:49.920
 it's not early morning until late evening. You know there are so many ritual manuals, manuals,

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:57.760
 or the instructions. Translate it. Translate it. Then you can look. So that's it really.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.920
 So beyond that they have to collect the water. They collected all those firewood necessary things

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.920
 and make that food or whatever they have. They can make those things simple. And then practice.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:18.000
 And one of the practices, most time, is meditation. And then joining the prayers.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.240
 So now, again, I go back just one more time. With ritual means I say that they are avoiding

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:38.480
 all the mundane, busy activities of the physical, verbally, and mentally. And what that means?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.960
 When we avoid that, what do we have to do now? And avoiding all the mundane physical activities,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.360
 the old activities, through the physical, a good activity, such as in the teaching said,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:40:00.480
 all stations, certain umbrellas into the stupas or the temples. Something that recollects your

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:09.040
 joy in the devotion activities. And breathe calm and peaceful in the morning. When you avoid the

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:16.000
 mundane physical work of the verbal activities, when you can't avoid, when you reach it from there,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.440
 what do you do? Reciting the mantras. Reciting the prayers. Reciting the suttas. Or join,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:32.400
 read the suttas. Suttas, again, that reflected our joy in the devotees. Inspire, bring,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:40.240
 is more inspire ourself. And compassion, loving kindness. Read the life stories of all those

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:48.560
 great masters. Read suttas. Or read with the way and the lives of the activity of the bodhisattvas.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:55.600
 Those are beautiful. Just really touch today's heart when you read those teachings.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:03.680
 Teachings. So read those. And then avoiding the mundane activity of the mental, such as a vow,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:10.720
 or the negative emotions, and discursive thoughts, unnecessarily these and that things. Bring more

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:19.600
 love, compassion, joy, relaxed mind, and the natural status, or the docking status, or Mahamudra

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:30.640
 status. Relax. And what it will do? It will bring the true inner natures of the mind's qualities.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:40.400
 Peace, harmonious. Those are the warmth of the brain realization. Then the sun of realization

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:50.640
 will shine, which is wisdom, and love, and compassion. All united target as one beautiful

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.760
 status. So those are the teachings said that. And so that is my brief talk for today. And I thank

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.360
 you very much again for listening to me, and to thank everyone again. And maybe you do now short.
