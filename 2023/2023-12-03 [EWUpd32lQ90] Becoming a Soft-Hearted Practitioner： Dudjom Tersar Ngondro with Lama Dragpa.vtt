00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.840
 Thank you, thank you friends, Dharma family, thank you.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.660
 So the topic today is becoming a soft-hearted practitioner, becoming a soft-hearted practitioner.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.840
 So we'll just jump right into it and reactivate these three motivations that Ven.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 Kenpo Rinpoche has always encouraged us to do whenever we begin studying or practicing

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.880
 the Dharma, and anytime we're doing anything, actually, to try to really highlight and make

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.280
 a living kind of presence of joy and appreciation, bodhicitta, and pure perception.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.200
 It's a joy and appreciation, or gratitude, or renunciation mind.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.680
 We're really highlighting all the amazing qualities.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880
 And we're not emphasizing so much all the negative things or the difficult things, but

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.680
 so we're really bringing into the front of our awareness all the special circumstances

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.040
 that we have surrounding.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:30.280
 And bodhicitta have this deep concern and care, this love and appreciation for all the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.960
 beings near and far, myself included, but all these wonderful beings, we all have this

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.820
 Buddha nature, and if we're sentient beings, we don't see that so much.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.960
 So we're constantly getting into trouble that's very preventable, but it's just so tempting.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.120
 We just keep getting into so much trouble and so much suffering, and it's really sad.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.240
 So just really with genuine compassion, "Oh, really?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 May we be free of all these suffering and these causes of suffering, recognize our goodness,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 our Buddha nature, and each other, and everyone we meet, and all the beings, really highlight

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.720
 the Buddha nature, and like wish every single being be free of suffering and the causes

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
 of suffering.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.520
 And I'll become enlightened, fully awakened, so that I can really care for beings in this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:44.480
 way to bring about the enlightenment of all beings."

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.520
 And deepening that appreciation and recognition of Buddha nature, all beings have Buddha nature,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.960
 the very nature of mind is pure, perfect, complete, has everything, all the glorious,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.080
 wonderful qualities, it's naturally stainless and perfect.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 So we've heard these teachings, so we're kind of bravely, we're also really relaxedly in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.520
 this kind of, very kind of joyfully, just try to allow that nature to just shine out

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.960
 and to see that, to really see that in our experience, in our surroundings, and those

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.960
 who are around, what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, reflect on, these are all just movements

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:51.500
 of Buddha nature happening in our direct experience.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:17.300
 Thank you, so, becoming a soft-hearted practitioner, many of us have had just like the exceptional

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:25.360
 fortune to be around beings, people, who've really mingled their lives, their hearts and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.920
 their minds with Dharma, Venerable Kenshin Paul and Chair Rinpoche, Venerable Kenpo Seo

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.440
 and Doanor Rinpoche, sure, their father Lamachime, his son is Dujur Rinpoche, his son is the Dala

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.040
 Lama, his son is Saketra Zen.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.120
 There's so many masters, and like sometimes we've had the great fortune to be around some

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.400
 of these beings, many of us, and we can see their teachings kind of indirectly, in videos,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.800
 podcasts, can read their writings, it's such a special time now, but they're these living

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.320
 examples of what it means like to be accomplished in the Buddha Dharma, to really fully mingle

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:17.600
 with the nature, to be natural, and there's just so much care.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.400
 We can know, in my experience, the little window of time I've gotten to be at Padmasamyaling,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.000
 this wonderful Vajra family, the Sangha, and around Venerable Kenpo Rinpoche's, how many

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.760
 precious opportunities to be in their presence, and they're just so kind.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.040
 There's just like this emanating atmosphere of kindness, and just a deep courage, and

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:56.280
 this unshakeability, this mighty dignity, and this uncompromising kind of care and dedication

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.080
 to the Dharma, to the Buddha Dharma, to the teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni, Guru Padmasambhava,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.240
 all these lineage masters.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.400
 Some of us have had that, and we really know this is not an idea like we've been in their

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.680
 presence.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.840
 What is it like when someone's so mingled, so natural, they're so infused with the Dharma

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.040
 all the time?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:28.280
 There's so much kindness, there's so much flexibility.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:40.040
 They're just so elegant, and so timely, and so free, and so present.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.920
 They really care about details, they really show up when they're with you, when they're

00:06:46.920 --> 00:07:00.960
 kind of teaching in the in-between times, they're just so tuned in, they're really in touch.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:11.800
 They're so soft-hearted, and that's like, that's kind of an, it's one of those fortunes

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:21.960
 that it's invaluable, because we can see directly for ourselves what it's like to be accomplished

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:30.000
 in this path, that it's possible, and we have living examples, and we can ask them for help,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.040
 for guidance, well how can I do this, and what are the steps for me, specifically for

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.240
 me with my afflictions and obscurations and challenges, and they'll give us just fine-tuned

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:47.760
 exact advice and guidance, that then we have to apply ourselves in our formal practice,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:08:06.240
 and in our lives, and we can see if it works, and enjoy the benefit.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.280
 All the Dharma is aiming, like so many, it's such a radical teaching, and it's in Sutra

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:19.400
 Mahayana, and maybe we've heard it some, I'm sure, that in the end Dharma leads us where

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:27.080
 we actually care about others more than ourselves.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.480
 We're around others, and we genuinely, from the core of our heart, we just care about

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:42.200
 others first, and we've been around beings, and you can tell that's what they're doing.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.960
 They come into a room, they don't think everyone look at me, or listen to me, or this is why

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.560
 I'm so great, like they don't have that, it's just that stickiness is just not in their

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 field.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:00.240
 You can just feel it, you can see how that's, they're so free of that, because there's such

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:10.780
 a deep care and kindness to other beings, and it's so steady, and they're so active and

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:21.080
 ready to help, they just respond with what's needed.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.040
 So that's what kind of, I think, as a lived experience more, that's kind of what I'm thinking

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:35.320
 of, when I think of a soft-hearted practitioner, they're not just filled with a lot of ideas

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:44.760
 about Dharma, they're really in touch with living Dharma in their experience right now,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.520
 deep wisdom and deep compassion, at the same time they're not just escaping the worldly

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.160
 concerns and all the responsibilities by just only practicing as if it's some extra thing

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.040
 that you kind of do on the side or separate from life.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:07.240
 They practice ceaselessly, so much practice, so much study, but it's all so they can benefit

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:14.280
 other beings more, more beings, more effectively, you can just see it.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.720
 I mean I don't know, I don't know what that's like from my personal experience, but I can

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:29.280
 see what other beings who like kapiramic is, what they're like, to become a really genuinely

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.200
 soft-hearted practitioner, and not just sensitive where there's anything happens and we're kind

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.560
 of upset, or anything happens and we get so reactive, not soft in that way.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.000
 Soft meaning really genuinely tender with compassion, and so there are these four types

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.760
 of compassion, Camperimic is taught on this about Chandra Kirti mentioned when he went

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:59.360
 to pay refuge, paid refuge to compassion, that's actually the source of all these qualities

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.080
 that we're activating, we're expanding, we're revealing in ourselves our Buddha nature qualities,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080
 compassion.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.040
 We can have compassion first, there's four kinds.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.400
 Compassion for a being who's suffering, you can see there's so much suffering, they're

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:23.800
 upset, their body's shaking, something just, they went through some challenge difficulty,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.000
 they lost a loved one, really upset, and we can have compassion for them, all this, and

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.720
 the emotions, it's really wish you didn't have to go through this, I wish I could take

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:44.880
 that on for you, you can be free of that suffering, that's the first kind of compassion.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.160
 The second kind of compassion is we're actually compassionate about the cause of the suffering,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.420
 oh I can see in my own mind, these are just disturbed, destructive states of mind, these

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:04.080
 negative emotions, this endless nam talk, conceptualization, always what's going on

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.800
 for me, what's this, what's that, and the story just unfolds endlessly, I'm the center

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.680
 character and basically what's happening to me.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.080
 So Buddhism define that in different ways, but always ignorance, we're not seeing clearly,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.360
 we're not one, you could say in Mahayana terms, we don't see our Buddha nature, we're seeing

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.440
 the coverings of the Buddha nature, the stains, the afflictive emotions, so we can have compassion

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.360
 for that, oh look there I go again, not seeing, I'm not seeing my Buddha nature, I'm not seeing

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.960
 the Buddha nature of the other being, oh really, this is so much suffering, this causes so

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:53.840
 much suffering, so instead of being so concerned emphasizing the outer, the more result aspect

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.520
 of the suffering, of being who's suffering, look a little closer, what's the cause of

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.680
 the suffering, we can have compassion for being caught up in those afflictive emotions,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.180
 the five poisons, that way if someone's really suffering in a way that's like makes us really

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.640
 scared, very nervous, we can not so much get caught with a person, but more with like what's

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.600
 actually causing the distress, let's say it's almost like a wounded animal, and it can't

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.160
 help if you go to a dog that's really so in so much pain and you go to pet it to calm

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.820
 it down and it just naturally, it can't stop itself, it just goes to bite you, it can't

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:42.280
 help it, what's the cause, not to get angry at the dog, but all the cause so caught in

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.000
 this suffering, this all this ignorance and this kind of all the afflictive emotions and

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.740
 they can't help it, you know, and we can have compassion for ourselves in that way too.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.280
 Then they say the third kind of compassion is just kind of more compassion without focus

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.880
 or it's compassion that doesn't require an object to be there for the compassion to be

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:13.160
 on, it's just more of like the pervasive nature of one's own awareness is just naturally

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.040
 compassionate,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:22.640
 it's naturally caring, it's naturally like responsive and receptive, inclusive and flexible,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:29.440
 that when the mind and the heart get open and settled, spacious, free, call it when

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.360
 it's kind of recognizes its emptiness, then it starts to like include more cause condition

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:46.440
 and effect just naturally, it just naturally extends this field of compassion and so that's

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.720
 the third kind of compassion, compassion without focus or without object, just being a radiating

00:14:51.720 --> 00:15:02.120
 kind of present awareness of compassion and then the fourth thing homage to compassion

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.960
 is just when that compassion then arises in a more tantra Mahayana or Vajrayana perspective

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.240
 arises as a deity, that compassion takes the shape, more expressive kind of outreaching

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:22.920
 power say you could arise as Chenrezig Buddha of compassion and this is a more kind of outreaching

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:32.000
 expression of the Buddha nature, so that's compassion arising as a deity, you can take

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.560
 this not just I'm a deity but in the mandala of the deity doing enlightened activities

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.800
 with other beings that are deities too, those that are around us, this is a fourth kind

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:56.360
 of compassion, I was thinking like how to actually, how do we actually you know free

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:08.760
 all beings from suffering, I mean it's just like there's endless beings throughout endless

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:23.480
 space, endless time and I was thinking for myself it can't be one by one for these noble

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:35.840
 ones and in my own kind of imaginative way that's more like playful or metaphorical in

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.400
 a way I kind of see it as these beings create really create these atmospheres that are so

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.480
 skillful like their presence, you know you see an experience where everyone shows up

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:56.800
 in a room say this room and Kemper Rinpoche is here teaching and there's like a bunch

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:03.400
 of people in this room and you can just feel the radiating presence of their bodhicitta,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:11.440
 it's just on and just happening and but everyone feels it in a different way and then Rinpoche

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.120
 gives a teaching and there's very different things that are highlighted by each student,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.880
 each person with what sticks out in their mind and their experience of what the Rinpoche

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:31.720
 said, how they were in the room, Rinpoche in this sense there's this atmosphere of compassion,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.600
 this bodhicitta is so big they're not trying to it's not like one by one they're trying

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.840
 to like connect with each being and then translate each thing one at a time as if it's just a

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.880
 computer kind of computing, they're just this field like a dharma like a tattoo like this

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.560
 spaciousness that's just suffused with compassion and we get in that and our own Buddha nature

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:02.320
 is in that space in that field and we relax in a way we feel seen our Buddha nature is like I can

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:02.480
 be

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:08.120
 comfortable here I can be like actually challenged or encouraged to like shine more brightly here,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.120
 this dignity turns on the kind of create courage of the Buddha nature turns on the clarity of the

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.920
 wisdom like suppleness or the kind of sparkling dazzling kind of outreaching compassion kind of

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.360
 turns on it's in this field this atmosphere of being in the presence of these enlightened

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.720
 beings these noble ones it's almost like in the field things just kind of settle and just more

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:44.400
 naturally they just settle into what they are I think that's much more doable in my mind that's

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:55.440
 more helpful in a living experience as the days go by which they keep doing right how can I just

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.560
 and right now I had to truly really activate some compassion some tenderness in my heart and some

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:09.160
 spaciousness in my mind and I don't need to know exactly what's the right thing to say or what's

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.280
 the exactly calculated right thing to do as if there's only one thing that's going to be a

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:22.160
 appropriate in a circumstance but just to genuinely like try to really generate compassion kindness

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:30.140
 and really see the kind of like this is such a flexible flowing kind of situation we're in this

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:35.360
 impermanence like Lama lai went through last week going through all the ways that this experience

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.880
 we have is so impermanent it's so fleeting it's like everything is instantly becoming a memory

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:49.240
 all the time we really try to hold our experience and it's just evaporates as we reach for it it's

00:19:49.240 --> 00:20:02.280
 really kind of like in one way scary how it's so beautiful we just can't pin it down we can

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:11.840
 never get it all the way we want it it just keeps moving and generate that's so scary if we're

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.040
 trying

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:18.560
 to control it look at this it creates so much opportunity for wonderful connection with beings

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:33.840
 to serve beings to like express love we try to do that more and more regularly just kind of wider

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:41.840
 more inclusively these four balance qualities you know like this is for all beings just be

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:48.320
 a field like to turn this on as a living experience wisdom and compassion and kind of try to really

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.280
 open the doors of our hearts our minds and that's really just kind of be this atmosphere of

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.560
 compassion

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:05.600
 and to see the illusory nature of the experience this wisdom quality as well and this can sound

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.520
 very general all of kind of what I'm saying now like where the five points and the fours of this

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.480
 and the three of that and the two things like in Buddha dharma is filled with these kind of

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.880
 checklists of very actionable very practical things we can do to actually become that to

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:29.280
 mingle our minds and hearts with that and we've heard so many of them and then part of what's

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.760
 kind of really needed is we need to know for ourselves and our minds and in this moment like

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:44.280
 which one is helpful for me right now which one of those things is it for boundless is it like par

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:55.160
 me to a discipline is it relaxing trying to see the true nature is it activating kind of a certain

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:02.440
 kind of quality of enlightened expression I mean there's just so many techniques we need to remove

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.120
 myself do I need a little more time for hermitage practice do I need to actually make a call to a

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:16.520
 person that I keep trying to avoid should I read a dharma book and I kind of really clarify some

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:23.480
 points maybe read a life story of yes she's sojaw say wow look at what she went through I have a

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.800
 hard time with my is you know plumbing getting clogged look at what yes she's sojaw went through

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:41.240
 wow this is she was undisturbable this is so courageous whatever these are all skillful means

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.520
 but we don't have to apply them all at once just what will help my mind now so with mindfulness

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:53.720
 self-awareness what's my what do I need now to just relax and be an atmosphere of compassion

00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:00.760
 for other beings and then it's like with with study reflection and meditation I think that

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:07.560
 atmosphere kind of really does crystallize it really gets more kind of like reflective of what

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.120
 someone else is going through and it can responsibly kind of reflect whatever's helpful

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:19.800
 for that particular being and that that is very helpful we were study knowing these lists of

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.720
 things and really seeing how do I tease apart the causal conditions of interactivity of

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.440
 relationship

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.800
 of interdependence dependent arising types of really kind of like conceptually really see that

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.840
 from a more variety of perspectives and to chew on it to contemplate it to really mingle with it

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:46.520
 and become it become those teachings saturate ourselves with meditation trying to really be

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.200
 in the four boundless states and then we see prayers prayers aren't just like a something

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.080
 we're accumulating or doing they're just reflective kind of like activating reminders

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:04.040
 this is what my experience is doing now and then I show up is this way and then this quality is

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.880
 turning on now and we're just like it's just a guidebook to our own present moment experience

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.520
 and we're just like kind of doing the highlight reel in real time of like all the wonderful

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.000
 lovely things that we're doing in asadana

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:30.760
 how to become a soft-hearted practitioner I don't know I find when I don't know I'm like

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:37.080
 obviously usually there's like a big stack of books here and I like dharma like scriptural dharma

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:43.800
 and dharma like realization or really applying it for sure but also you know the pithy part

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.360
 of just need to really know like what to apply right now and it needs to be simple need to be

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.640
 able to do that the great master atisha when he went to tibet when Tara encouraged him to go to

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.880
 tibet and he got there and he saw there was a great master I think it was Rinchan Zampo

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:08.440
 I think it was a really great translator great translator and he asked this great translator

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.840
 like what are the what do you know about dharma and he went on to explain all this scriptural

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.040
 dharma and it was so elegant and so extensive and comprehensive and atisha was like oh I don't

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:25.640
 really need to be here in tibet it's all all the dharmas here and then atisha asked this great

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:33.640
 master will like how do you practice all that and this great translator went on to say all this

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.680
 practices you need to do to accomplish each part of it and it'd take a long time very kind of like

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:46.280
 extensive gradual approach to practice and then atisha thought oh this is why I'm here

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:54.120
 how do we synthesize all the teachings together in a way that's very practiceable and practical

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:01.800
 that we can apply in our living experience right now and so oh this is really a benefit

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.080
 this is an important thing to be able to do and we can see like all these great masters this

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:15.960
 one is dujurimbechhe, miphamrimbechhe, longchampa, great rangzompa, ragaase, karma chagme, so many

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.280
 of these masters of course the kempa rimbechhes, venerable kempa rimbechhes they're so good at

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.560
 taking extensive teachings and distilling them into the very condensed simple points

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:34.760
 that all we have to do is just take the point connect with it with devotion with kind of the

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.280
 warps of devotion and really kind of activate it in our lived experience and it becomes this

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:46.120
 very simple elegant way to bring all the 84,000 teachings into a very simplified form and that's

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.880
 kind of what the dujurimbechhe does and it's what pith instruction essentially does

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.880
 and then it's up to us to like really turn on those qualities that the teachings are pointed

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.400
 to and to try to maintain that living thread of those pith instructions or those really synthesized

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:10.760
 very condensed pithy kind of like powerful points in our lived experience like the three noble ones

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:17.080
 like wisdom and compassion or all of it as one word bodhicitta

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:25.480
 but to do it in a way that really touches us it really moves us not just say bodhicitta

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:32.680
 or say pure perception as if acting like a dharma person is the same as really being dharma like

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.160
 really being soft really genuinely like having this tender hearted like i really others are more

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:49.000
 important than me there is a path to awakening and it's clear what the path is and it's possible to

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:58.200
 do it and there's gods living gods that can help us do it and it's challenging to go through a path

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:04.440
 of transformation and it's more challenging to suffer endlessly in samsara with no way out

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.800
 so the path is definitely going to activate the ways that we resist our own buddha nature the

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:17.160
 ways that we close up and shut down and kind of just me first and we forget this is about actually

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:26.360
 serving beings being a loving presence for other beings and so whatever it takes for us to do that

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.760
 in our lived experience if first we need to equalize we're all how are we all the same

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:37.480
 and then we can do exchanging practices i'm going to take my happiness and give it to you

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.320
 and i'll take your suffering and i will take it and i will genuinely want that to happen

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:51.640
 and eventually where that just becomes oh you're more important what can i do

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.720
 what can i do what can i do and we've been around beings that actually are like that

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.480
 and that is just like an impactful thing in the mind and the heart that it's just one of the most

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:07.640
 precious things we can ever experience to actually be around beings like that not just for an hour

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.770
 it's not like they had a good weekend or they're in front of a camera and so all of a sudden they

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:12.040
'll

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.400
 act real loving they're just it's like that when his only style ama says oh you should check your

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.840
 teacher spy on me he said his only style ama spy on me look at me how am i on the cushion off the

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.280
 cushion in between when it's hard when it's easy is there bodhichitta bodhichitta bodhichitta look

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.800
 at your teacher you can see if you go around be around to a place like this padmasamy ling long

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.560
 enough you can look at rambhiches all the in-between times they're just constantly caring about

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:39.960
 beings

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.760
 all the little ants and just everything they're just constantly wanting to

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:53.480
 care for a space where people come into it and it's like dharma

00:29:53.480 --> 00:30:02.360
 and we can become like that it's so lovely i mean i love all the to be a healing balm you know

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.160
 i love all the kind of systems of buddha dharma i mean it's just so extraordinary what the buddha

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:16.120
 taught and gurumche and then to see beings that have really they do that and they're so

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.920
 kind of they can change just like this elegant chameleon to fit exactly a situation

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:29.000
 that's easiest for bodhichitta to really turn on for people to really feel seen for the buddha

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.040
 nature to really shine on and it's just so lovely and amazing and i'll just repeat some just the

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:44.040
 words of rambhiches illuminating the path and just listen it's just so sweet like there's so

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.320
 many books and it's just so it's like really just comes off this is in their bodhichitta section

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.520
 generation of bodhichitta and illuminating the path it's almost like you can just pick up these

00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:01.080
 books and like pick a page like there's just just see then it's like so much dharma just coming out

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.520
 page 97 to practice the dharma does not mean running away from samsara

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.560
 since we're already engaged in this world we should observe everything closely

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.280
 until we begin to practice we're always trying to hide and escape from pain

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:25.000
 this is futile because we always end up unhappy but by practicing the dharma we can be free

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.440
 within the world and engage it creatively when we practice looking closely we discover the inner

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.040
 patterns of life and no longer feel the need to run away and hide this does not mean that we

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.240
 should settle for simply enduring samsara the buddha encouraged us to be brave and committed

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.040
 to our own enlightenment and to the enlightenment of all beings when we do this everything is

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.800
 transformed and purified we learn to move with situations full of vision and confidence whether

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:59.560
 here or in the bardo with this understanding we're able to enjoy and appreciate our situations

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.920
 maitreya the future buddha said that this realization lets us move from life to life

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:11.000
 as if we're strolling from one garden to another this expansion of compassion depends on our

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 attitude we might think how can i possibly love so many beings but we need not be discouraged

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.310
 since our mental potential is limitless and capable of extending everywhere to wish and imagine

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.560
 that

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.140
 our love reaches out in all directions to bless all beings is the practice of aspiration bori ch

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.360
itta

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.600
 though we may not see immediate results through bori chitta we will eventually fulfill our wishes

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.760
 we need to open our hearts to all living creatures until now we've been trapped and

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.040
 have limited our ability within a cocoon of ego clinging and attachment to ourselves and phenomena

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.320
 without being discouraged we can break through this cocoon with our loving intentions

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.000
 bori chitta opens our hearts to radiate love and compassion to all beings this is what we have to

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.160
 practice it just keeps going on and on i mean it's like in one way simple and things we've heard so

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:13.640
 much but it's just all there and there's two more books just to say because i mean of course

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:20.200
 on the path to enlightenment hard advice from great tibetan masters this is compiled by machi

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:26.680
 rekard and it goes into all these different three yana approaches to buddhism and i went to

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:37.640
 the compassion section here but there's just all quotes nojo ken rimbece page 80 nojo ken rimbece

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:45.800
 it's therefore essential to meditate all the time on love and compassion until we love others more

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:52.280
 than ourselves that is the lifeblood of our spiritual practice and must always remain so

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.040
 to love others more than ourselves it's so astounding

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:04.280
 and there's a passage by his only do a cancer impetit here page 83

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:12.440
 this i mean just this is like just dripping with things

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.920
 page 84 and so on as do a cancer mache it's very important to meditate with your whole being on

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:24.440
 bodhicitta until it becomes clear just how meaningless and frustrating the activities

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:30.280
 of this life really are you will be touched and saddened by the debilitated condition of

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.880
 beings in this dark age and a strong feeling of determination to be free from samsara will arise

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:42.040
 if these attitudes truly take root the qualities and achievements of the mahayana the great vehicle

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.720
 are sure to grow from them but if that genuine determination to be free from samsara is not

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.600
 firmly implanted in your mind your dharma practice will never be able to fully develop

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.920
 all sentient beings are the same and wishing to be happy and not to suffer

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:03.800
 the great difference between oneself and others is in numbers there's only one of me but countless

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.920
 others so my happiness and my suffering are completely insignificant compared to the

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.800
 happiness and suffering of infinite other beings what truly matters is whether other beings are

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.640
 happy or suffering this is the basis of bodhicitta we should wish others to be happy rather than

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.440
 ourselves and we should especially wish happiness for those whom we perceive as enemies

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.560
 and those who treat us badly otherwise what is the use of compassion

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.680
 i mean we're just so privileged and then we're just one more from this only is dojram Rinpoche

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.880
 a torch lighting the weight of freedom the complete instructions on the preliminary practices

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.400
 his only is dojram Rinpoche again in his bodhicitta section for the dojram chairsar nandro

00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:03.320
 soft-hearted soft-hearted is when we hear these teachings it's like oh my gosh like this is

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.920
 amazing you know if we don't have that it means something's wrong i mean honestly when i pick up

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:15.640
 a dharma book and i'm like okay that means something's not active in my mind it's not the

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.360
 that's why they say with teachers right teachers shouldn't have to be all charismatic and

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.800
 entertaining and basically sell the dharma the dharma sells itself like if we're actually

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.240
 activating the dharma in our experience these even this word of this dharma is wow this is a

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:37.400
 total treasure this is exactly the helpful thing but then that's up to us each of us you know

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:44.200
 not rely so much on the container or the expression the person the cup but like what's the tea like

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.960
 what's in the drink what's the ambrosia of dharma what's actual dharma to really ready ourselves to

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:56.280
 like be impacted or moved by the dharma you know great masters would just make that easy

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.000
 they make it so easy for us

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:11.480
 196 sentient beings are identical to us and all wanting to be happy we're all the same and not

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:18.280
 wanting to suffer and we are also all the same in our ultimate nature and that we have no intrinsic

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.680
 existence moreover since there's only one of me whereas other beings are very numerous

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.840
 not only are we equal but other beings are more important so this is the same this is like this

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.360
 echoed by all the masters for this reason this wish to bring all beings to buddhahood is not to

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.720
 be left as a merely an intellectual idea i mean must be something you definitely apply to your

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:48.920
 own mind to make progress in this you must cease to consider yourself important but consider any

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:56.200
 sentient being even if it is only a single one as extremely important thus you should be only too

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.040
 willing to devote yourself exclusively to helping others in both your thoughts and deeds joyfully

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:08.440
 undertaking even very painful ordeals for their sake if you know it will make them happy by

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.040
 thinking of others welfare even when you're moving about walking lying down or sitting you will be

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.080
 training and accumulating merit and wisdom on a vast scale these being the means for making

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.160
 bodhichitta grow because we're ordinary beings faults and downfalls that transgress the bodhisattva

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:31.560
 vow often occur and we must be certain to part from them and renew our vow in the best case in

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.120
 each of the six periods of day and night in the middling case at the beginning and end of four

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:43.480
 sessions at the very least once a day and once a night to renew the bodhisattva vow should it

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.760
 happen that negative forces make you ill or injure you people speak ill of you are your afflictive

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.920
 emotions become very intense pile up on top of such situation all the undesirable things that

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.680
 happen to beings sorry pile up on top of such situations all the undesirable things that happen

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.480
 to beings if you find yourself in painful circumstances recognize that it is because

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.600
 your past deeds and instead of getting depressed take on others suffering if you find yourself in

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:16.920
 happy situations dedicate your wealth and influence to virtuous ends do not remain idle

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.920
 but spur yourself to performing positive actions physically and verbally and pray that all beings

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:28.520
 may be happy whatever unpleasant things happen to you falling ill getting depressed getting

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:28.760
 involved

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.560
 in disputes suffering loss or defeat rather than feeling resentful of others put the blame on

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:42.680
 yourself thinking this is simply my reward for considering myself more important goes on and on

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:51.800
 this is just like the vast view of these really noble ones that we've had the good fortune to be

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.840
 around this i think is just really pointing out to how they are even if we're not there yet i'm

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:02.040
 certainly not there yet at all i hear that and my ego starts to shake and tremble and fight it you

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:08.520
 know but i'm important too you know like it's just like that's very highlighted in our very

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.840
 hyper individual culture but me what about me so i have that training and conditioning but being

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.560
 around these beings it's really like they just don't have that happening in their minds and their

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.240
 hearts you can just tell be in their presence in their atmosphere of kindness and compassion

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:29.960
 so really genuinely following in their footsteps really like try to really just be an atmosphere

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:36.200
 of kindness at the very least we're trying to not harm beings really kind of love them

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:43.560
 just quietly low-key quiet do our practice make it really try to really make it genuine

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.440
 even just for as we do practice if we can really try to genuinely bring up this heart

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:58.040
 of compassion all beings may this be a cause for every single being to be enlightened very soon

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.760
 just really pray and ask the buddhas to make this wish true look at look ask the buddhas

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.760
 look at me if this is really true this wish i really wish this to happen please use all your

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.320
 skillful means to make the wish come true all beings be free of suffering the cause of suffering

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:25.320
 that's kind of it how to become a soft-hearted practitioner it's more just becoming it the how

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.200
 is like we've received the teachings but just the just to know what a soft-hearted practitioner

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:36.120
 they're actually these very brave beings and they don't treat themselves as doormats or that

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:43.320
 they're very clear and detailed very uncompromising with the dharma authentic lineage dharma

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:51.320
 and they just always love beings they're always loving impartially and they celebrate other

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:57.720
 beings happiness they just they're so happy when other beings are happy and then they just continue

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:05.000
 today's a good day tomorrow's a better day you could see every day rippet chaise to finish the

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.040
 stupa project one day the next day they're on to the next project i've seen it a million times

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:19.880
 from my perspective it's exhausting but from their perspective it's more to celebrate more

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.560
 ways to serve beings more ways to honor the three jewels the buddha dharma look at this precious

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:35.800
 opportunity we have let's do more stupas let's i mean they just keep going right right we've

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:42.360
 really seen it and then we have that we just join their wave help when we can take a break try to

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:48.200
 relax reconnect to our practice and our motivation really try to like okay what's the point of the

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.320
 dharma make it a lived experience just even for a minute really turn on this heart of art of

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:59.000
 enlightenment this really close feeling to beings close feelings to the teachers the lineage really

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.360
 feel it i don't really really feel it and that's like the devotion to really be a soft-hearted

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:13.880
 practitioner i love it it's like a very special thing to be in the presence of beings who are

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:21.880
 really turning that on and each other too because if say these noble ones have it always on but if

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.760
 you're around a friend and you can tell they really care about you and their love's coming out

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.280
 and they're really genuinely interested and they just like they're thinking of your happiness you

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.680
 know they're like celebrating you like in those moments we can be that for each other you know

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.120
 this is sangha mutual support to sangha we can really help uplift each other like that

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.520
 don't have to wait till we're on the boomies or something we do that now just from these little

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:52.280
 bits little short periods and like we really boost each other up and that's kind of living

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:57.240
 kind of living dharma bit by bit and i think it's amazing how much big impact that has

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:04.200
 for each other like for ourselves so thank you so much friends when we practice together

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:18.840
 thank you thank you simple but true i think simple but true

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:35.980
