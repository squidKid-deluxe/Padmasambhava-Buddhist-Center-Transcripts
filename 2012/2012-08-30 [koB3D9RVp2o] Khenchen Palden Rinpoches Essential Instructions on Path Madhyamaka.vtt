00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.940
 "The great Master Nunkhima said of great master omniscient Nunkhima said the Path meditation

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 of the three Path Madhyamaka, the two accumulations, relaxing on the comfortable cushions, with

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.380
 radial postures, take a ruffle, level up both each other, and then meditate. Meditating within

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.240
 its own natures, not that which you already established. And we need to come to the meditation,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.880
 and again the same way as the Dzogchi teaching, relaxing in the natural state of the mind,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 as well as relaxing in the natural state of the mind, and you are not going to hold anything,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.700
 just simply relaxing mind in the natural state of the mind, without expanding, without alerting

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.780
 or changing things, and not going to concentrate or think of the external object, nor in the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.340
 mental image of things, resting in the natural state. When you are relaxing on the natural

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 state of that present state, which is then known as also free from the subject and the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.700
 optic notions of the duality, there is nothing to negate it, nothing to accept it, nothing

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.780
 to do. It is just a relax, just a relax in that natural state. When you are relaxing in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.260
 that natural state, you are going to behold, behold self-awareness wisdom, self-awareness

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.100
 wisdom, that which is not really, can't explain anything, just is being present in that. And

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 that's what the great master also, Chantideva said in his teaching, the Bodhicharyavatara.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.660
 When you relax on the natural status, there is nothing to see object, non-object, nothing

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:14.260
 it is. It is totally, totally relaxed, free from all the conceptions, totally time to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.100
 follow it, free from state. That is the meditative state. When you meditate on this accumulation

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:34.260
 of the madhyamakas. And then, in the post-meditation, then as you see, everything is magic, dream.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 It is there, but it is not solitude. It is like dream status. It is all like dream. And

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 with that dream understanding, and then delegate the merits to all the dreamers, whatever the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 that merit by practice, meditating on this whatever, that during that practice, delegate

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 that merit with your kind and complete thought for all beings of magic, beings. And in each

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 of those periods of time, this life is dream, this life is magic, and not grasping, not

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.260
 clinging too much. Let it come, let it go. And then, with this attitude or with this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.260
 realization, and when you have regular times, do post-meditation, do satan humanas, do read

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:34.260
 books, or read the satanas, or make the chachas, or do the song, those in the Tibetan, they

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 used to do water offerings, water offerings. And all the activities, the meditative activities,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.260
 don't ignore. Good activities that benefiting to others, or that activity reflecting of

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 your devotion and joy, don't ignore all that. And that is all known as the following, the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.260
 practicing of the part Madhimaka, and accumulating the true merits, merits, merits, and that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.260
 will bring the full realization of the absolute nature of the the ordinary nature of the Buddha,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.260
 or Buddha nature, that will discover, discover within the Dharma status. This then, when

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.260
 you discover that nature, that is known as you are meeting the great Mother, the Mother

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.260
 of all the Buddhas, that moment of all the enlightened beings, sorry, all the Mother

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.260
 of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the enlightened beings of the three times, that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:47.260
 is what you met, that is what it is, what it is. You meet, meet, and so those, and with

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.260
 this again, and then again in the false meditation, as I said, I mean here, as Kilma said, as

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.260
 I said, everything is magic, everything dream, everything reflection, image is, is matter.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.260
 It's exactly what the Buddha used example. Those example is exactly the same thing, what

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.260
 it is. This is also not separate the two truths. It's union of two truths, absolute, relative,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.260
 without any things. Within that status, all the path and the ground and the result are

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.260
 concluded. And then that concluded and then you realize, you realize that. And that is

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.260
 the, what the path of this Mademaka, or the practice of this Mademaka is. So that's the

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:44.260
 magic. And so that's it.
