00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.810
 Thank you very much for your support and for your support. I am very grateful and thank you all for

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.200
 your support. Thank you very much.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.830
 Again, we must be grateful to the teachers of the great teacher, Bhadakshatamuni, who is pointing

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.870
 out our own innate nature of the mind and nature of everything, and therefore is one of the very

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.440
 grateful moments in which we currently have a life and for that reason,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:40.450
 wisdom, hatred, joy, and everything. And I hope that we think then, both each other, the vastness,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.680
 motivation of the ethnic, both each other, think your own living beings, whatever I am doing and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 whatever we are going to do here,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.320
 discussing the teaching of the Buddha, we really need that benefit to all living beings, remove

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.970
 suffering, difficulty, trouble, because they are all wicked, sincerely wicked, it is not just as

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.160
 talk and live service, service is really wicked,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:16.140
 strongly, sincerely from the bottom of our heart, or even intubated, you say, even from the bone

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 from the heart, bone of heart, let's think of that, strong in that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 And at the same time, everything is purely status, even though we don't see these moments because

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.840
 due to the characteristics of our URL, we don't see where things are, but at the reality level, it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.800
 is all enlightened in the purely status.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.490
 Today we have reflected the teaching of the Buddha Dharma is because we like to remove the categor

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:54.240
ize of these dualities, we like to see real things exactly as is, and subject level, object level,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.440
 we like to point out exactly.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.460
 When you point exactly as it is, what is that known as any Buddha's teaching or Buddhism? You

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.040
 become the enlightened. That is enlightened.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.920
 You are enlightened because you remove the darkness of the dualities, darkness is removed, you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.110
 become the light, we become the light, that light is not just a one direction, shining every

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 direction, and every time, and every space, and every inner and outer space, everything, shining,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 that is known as enlightenment.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:43.010
 What that light mind is, that is what we are discussing here. It is true love and kindness, it is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:52.230
 compassion, it is wisdom, it is calm and peaceful, it is courage and commitment and understanding,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.640
 perfectly exactly as it is.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.800
 And when you become the enlightenment in what the teaching says, our love and compassion will be

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.840
 infinite as sky and deep as ocean, even more than that.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.990
 And our wisdom light, our wisdom is more powerful than any other campaign that. This moment we call

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:25.770
 inconceivable, but that time, we will conceive it as it is, as it is, because our wisdom is more

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.840
 exciting as it is, the highest stated, deepest states that you can go with agreeing that.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.840
 But in time, everything is limited. Love is limited, compassion is limited, kindness is limited,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.550
 wisdom is limited, everything is limited for us, everything is limited. Why? Because of the duality

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.840
.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.790
 This publication of duality, that making limited everything, everything will go kind of bounce,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.840
 bounce, bounce, every day when we turn, everything is kind of tight, the tightest kind of thing.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:10.490
 That is duality. Who created this duality? Who did this war and this restrictions? Nobody else did

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.840
 for us except one's own self.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 We did that. When we did this, we did this at the biggest times, from the biggest times.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.060
 Every time we added, every time we added, added, added, added, so our habit dependent, you want it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.840
 to become stronger, stronger, stronger and stronger.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.910
 Every time we added, when we added, in the mental states, every two, simple, all the way is stated

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.840
 in the allies or that grown level, we added and it becomes thicker and thicker.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.400
 And now who is going to, who is going to clear away that boundary that restrictions? Nobody else is

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.840
 going to do that for us except our self.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.040
 We did it at the beginning of time. We also have to do, do, have to clean up. We have the full

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840
 responsibilities.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:18.320
 Guruji Sri Chitra, Buddha Shapte Mune, Gaurabhamma Sambhavai, all those great masters show us

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.840
 techniques, how to do, clear away that, how to do that techniques, instrumentals.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.940
 All that techniques and instrumentals, the equipments of the true clay way that is fully developed

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.840
 and completely layout, so perfectly, so beautiful, beautiful.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:55.050
 That one gracious teacher, Buddha Shapte Mune, the omniscient one, not just the omniscient one, but

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.310
 compassionate one, caring one, concerning one, thinking of every one, their deed and their

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.840
 capabilities, not pulsing, not pushing, pushing, perhaps, according their capabilities, how to

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840
 clear up this.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.270
 Showed every techniques. There is no shortage of techniques and equipment to clean away our mess

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.840
 that we created.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.790
 There is no shortage. Therefore, Buddha Shapte Mune is a pool of richness. Every aspect, externally

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.840
 we look subject to level, object to level, everywhere.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.270
 And even modern scientists will level, metaphysical level, all the current presenters level,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:34.840
 neuroscience level, every aspect it can catch up, it can mend up, it can join and can discuss.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.720
 Don't have to be shy from that. You can really know Buddha's teaching. You can fully, courageously,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.840
 joyfully engage into those great scholars modern times.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.210
 Because Buddha told the way that nature is, not just a board from the mythological story of the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.840
 other planets, it's exactly where it is.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.180
 That is what it is. And therefore, again, for real, we stand in a joy and appreciate, and the body,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:15.840
 the pure in our state. Those are the way and key and essential.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:24.250
 To break that wall of the dualities. That is, break the wall of duality and remove. Where are we

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.310
 going to break that duality wall and where are we going with that truth, that garbage, that mess,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.840
 that's the way we are going through.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:40.090
 Don't have to try garbage anywhere. It's called self-liberating. It releases right there. As

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:49.910
 morning sunshine comes, where the darkness is gone, when morning the dawn heat in the sky, where

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.840
 darkness is gone.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:01.160
 How that morning sun shines, shines gradually, and the darkness gradually begins to separate. That

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.840
's the way our practice, gradually develops with the inner enlightened college.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:17.980
 And gradually removing all those duality propagation walls within its own truths, or within its own

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.840
 states, within its own natural states.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:32.680
 What are those known as in the Buddha's teaching? Path and the Bhumis. Path and the Bhumis are way

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.840
 developing our enlightenment wisdom, way hence how we remove the obscurations of these dualities.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:47.980
 How we remove, that measure, this guideline, this in a way, inner guidelines, inner lot science,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:56.370
 lot science, how we are removing, how we progress, everything is a measure so that we can have the

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:03.840
 confidence, the joy and the appreciation, continue we can advance, until the final distractions.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.840
 Until the final goal of the discordment, that is one of the teachings.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.840
 Now, among those all teachings, it goes.
