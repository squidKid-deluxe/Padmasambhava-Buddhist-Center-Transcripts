00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
 I think you all know this is not something I'm making. Again, as I said many times in the past,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.280
 this is what I said something. It's not something that you don't know and you've heard only the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.840
 first times. This is because I'm talking this to remind each of us to kind of strengthen our

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.880
 practices.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 So I always sound a member of what is teaching said, support each other. So we all sound our

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 members.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.400
 We are following the path of enlightenment according to our best capabilities. It is

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.800
 responsibilities. It is, in a way, that obligation to each other to support the help, to according

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 to that clarification, and that is what it is. So therefore, again, the other day I mentioned about

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 the rafuddhi, you see, and rafuddhi when you talk, but the essence of rafuddhi is the devotions,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.240
 and the devotion can be divided in three or four. Those I mentioned in that. And today I'd like to

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.360
 talk really about bodhicata. Bodhicata generally is hard for the zokki practices. Zokki bodhicata

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:12.400
 can be divided into one, known as two bodhicata. Relative truth bodhicata, absolute truth bodhicata

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.400
.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.280
 So there's two bodhicata. And relative truth bodhicata and absolute truth, both are zokki,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.080
 particularly absolute truth bodhicata is zokki practice. It is zokki. Therefore, many times,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.560
 as N.K.T. Pardekarambhir said and I heard from his on the new retreat many times, named zokki

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.440
 teachings as bodhicata teachings, bodhicata teachings. So that's all named. So I'd like

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.380
 to talk with a little bit of highlight of this bodhicata, particularly as a relative level bodhic

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.720
ata.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.960
 Absolute truth bodhicata we're doing. This zokki practice is absolute

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.320
 truth bodhicata. We're talking. So what I'd like to highlight as he said, relative truth

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.920
 bodhicata. Now when we talk the relative true bodhicata, generally what do you think? When you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.120
 follow the spiritual path. Path, there is according to the great master Aditya. Aditya is one of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.280
 the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.320
 great masters that who visited India. He was also descended from great master Shandharakheta.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.000
 Shandharakheta was early born in the same family and later then as another his great, great, great

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.840
 children. He is one of the great master known as Aditya. Aditya and Aditya himself were in teaching

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 life story. When the great bodhisattva was bodhisattva, Shandharakheta was born, that same

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.400
 client that this great master Aditya was born. Aditya became one of the great masters in India.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 To be there, there has been so many, so fortunate to have so many great master who visited since

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 Gaurabhema Sambhava, great master Shandharakheta came to Tibet. After that many great masters

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.640
 visited one after another. And among that, then Aditya become one of the great masters who really

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.240
 made big beneficial, big impact, impact in the Tibetan Buddhism to highlight of the essential

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.280
 point of the teachings. That's what this great master Aditya did. So Aditya, one of the great

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.800
 Aditya has highlighted teaching, it's not just Aditya's teaching, it is Buddha's teaching. When

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.200
 you follow the spiritual path there is three individuals, divided as three individuals.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.600
 And the first, second, and third individuals. Those are named as also small individuals,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:54.080
 and medium individuals, and bigger individuals. And what they practice? What spiritual practice?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.560
 Generally, when you become spiritual, what that means? You become quite devoted. You become

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.840
 devoted. When you have some degree of devotion, that individually is named, I think, world as

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.400
 spiritual, spiritual. So this is what spiritual is. And now according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.880
 there is three types of the practices. Those are known as devotion, renunciation, and bodhicata.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.560
 Those are three. All are connected, these three. First we need as listed names, first the most

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.400
 important is devotion. As I said the other day, and you good, Buddha said devotion is the role

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.840
 of the enlightenment, the role of the visitors. And we don't have the devotion, our role is closed.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.960
 And the devotion I divided into four, I mean not just I, I follow the teachings of the Buddha

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.320
 and the great masters, they go to three or four different devotions. The first devotion is

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.040
 interest. And we don't have that interesting, that attitude. There's no spiritual growth welcome,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.960
 or come and turn and open our door. And the ventilation of the skylight, there's no light

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.040
 welcome. So devotion is the first important. Once we have devotions, second the most important is,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.920
 in the Buddhism, the renunciation. Renunciation thought is very important. Renunciation can be

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.960
 translated as a training of the mind, or that uproot the samsara, that will happen. Or it will make

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.800
 our heart circle like that. Once we have the renunciation, that means once we have the devotion,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.180
 once we have the renunciation like a head cube, and then what we need? We need bodhicata, bodhicata

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.760
.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.480
 With all the bodhicata, again we can go far. Therefore bodhicata is important. According to

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:07.040
 these three practices, there are three types of individualism. If you can summarize, according to

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.760
 the Great Master's article, or as the Buddha teaches, then there are three types, three

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:26.560
 individuals. Four, small individuals, and medium individuals, and big individuals. Those are the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.480
 three individuals. The first, small individual is what? They have the devotions, but that attitude,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:42.160
 how the courage and the commitment, how weakens are, is divided into, because of their vision,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.840
 their goals, not just the individual, their physical or their situations, but their inner

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.760
 situation, according to their courage and commitment, and divided into small, medium, and big.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.160
 Small

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.000
 individuals, those bracket who have devotions, but they are thinking, "Oh, I read the books,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.440
 I heard this teaching, I like to be happy. Happy, and I like to have the happy content of my lives,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:17.120
 and also I like to have the devotions. They think I have to have nice rebirth in the future."

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.880
 Kind of thinking of that small thought, that's kind of like, almost a little more connected with

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.720
 their individual, their one's own individualist and thought practices. Practicing dharma, or

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.520
 practicing meditating, that is known as small individuals. So that's the only kind of thinking,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.600
 not just only, merely, I said, merely or principally thinking themselves, and practicing doing good

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.200
 things, which is wonderful, which is good. That means bring more harmony, peace, good

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:55.520
 spiritual of the Buddha teaching is more harmony, more peace, more joy, more appreciation, bring

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.440
 good things in the life and the lives of others. So that is good, very good. And the second is,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:11.200
 then, the medium individuals. Medium individuals, what? Medium individuals, they have now devotions

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.200
,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.160
 not just the devotions, but they have these four renoxation thoughts. Four renoxations,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.320
 renoxation attitudes. Renoxation attitude, I won't go today, but I will list the names,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.200
 and you all know. These four renoxation thoughts, first it is the precious lives.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.800
 Our life is not just cause, co-accidental, beautiful life that we have. And the second is

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:45.760
 empowerment. Everything is empowerment. And the fourth is cause and effort. So third is cause and

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:55.200
 effort are inseparable, or in, what's it called? Infinitive. Infinitive, they cannot mix that.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.390
 Cause and the result goes, goes side by side. As cause and condition, the result comes exactly that

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:03.600
.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.000
 As the result, definitely depends with the cause and condition. There are no excuses. No, there is

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.880
 kind of like emergency exit, those things. You have to have that. And the samsara,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:24.000
 fourth is samsara is largely difficult to be challenged. This is samsara. These four are the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.680
 common sense, knowledge. It's not just Buddhist dhoma or religious dhoma. This is the way they

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:40.480
 acknowledge it. Not acknowledge it. It is true. Life is a trip. Life is breakers. Everything is

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.800
 impermanent. Cause and condition, effort is followed exactly as it. Samsara has challenged

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 any difficulties. This, when you have that understanding clearly, strongly, what it does

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:02.960
 is called renunciations. It will soften our renunciation, something of our grasping cleanness.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:09.040
 It brings more common sense, knowledge in our heart and mind. So we will become more gentle,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:17.520
 not always craving, always greedy. It will make more precious. Oh, it's good. Feel more happy.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.360
 We will begin to settle down on the ground on our feet. We will not hover in the sky.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.880
 We will not carry it by the emotions. There it is called renunciations or train of mind. It will

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:38.800
 make that knowledge. So now once you have that, that those people who have this understanding,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.040
 those have the devotions and the renunciation, those who are practicing dharma, we can also

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.120
 like to leave this samsara. I don't like to even take rebirth in the samsara. I like to leave

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.960
 complete samsara. Kind of having that attitude in practice, those are known as medium individuals

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.960
 or mediocre individuals. And we highlight who are they? According to what I was taking on Mahayana

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.160
 point with, those are great ahasas. Of course, they are kind of great masters, they are great

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.080
 practices. It's not something that, but however, their kind of attitude or vision or goal is just

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.680
 like to leave this samsara. Samsara, they don't like to return to the samsara. And therefore,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.640
 they call Mahayana, but in Nirvana, completely go beyond all the difficult troubles and then reach

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:41.120
 the Nirvana states. Those individuals are named here as mediocre practices. And now we go to the

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:49.600
 third, the big practitioner or big individuals. Big individual is their mark. That was what they

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.920
 have. They have same thing. They have the devotion, they have the renunciation, understanding. Now,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.040
 they have the bodhicha. Bodhicha, that think of all the sentient beings.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.840
 And very, very sentient beings, I will be back to here in samsara as long as samsara is existing.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.800
 That long, I will turn rebirth. As the great Master Chantideva said in his teaching,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:27.200
 as long as space existing, as long as sentient beings existing, that long may I come back and

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:35.280
 help you to all these beings free from the suffering, the difficulties. Such gracious, open, widely

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:43.440
 proclamation of the prayers without any fears, without any thought. And that, that open heart

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:53.440
 as spaces. Big as a space, deep as a spaces, deep as the ocean. That long, that offering,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:13:00.230
 his or her Dalai Lama, also a giant that prayers, open, really giant that prayers, as long as sams

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.480
ara

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:09.760
 exist. And that long may I exist in the benefit for all these beings. And that is called big

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:17.920
 individuals. Big individuals. This is now, when you think of the sentient beings, what we heard.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:26.800
 We heard always Madisonian beings. Everyone see as mothers. Why they call this, this,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:34.000
 this? First again, I will go to list these names. This is the, one of again highlighted teachings

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.080
 of

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.050
 the Atisha and as well as the Buddha's teaching. So I will list these numbers and then we go a

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:40.240
 little

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:52.960
 over there. First recognizing mothers. Recognize mothers. Second is remembering kindness

00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:03.520
 of the mothers. And the third is like to gratitude, like to repay back, back.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:14.160
 And the third port is loving kindness, loving kindness with beautiful appreciations,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:26.880
 beautiful appreciations. And the fifth is, is affection with compassion, strong affection

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:39.840
 with compassion or sincerely affection with compassion. And sixth is, is, is, is good heart.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:56.720
 Or if I translate it also, I saw the word kolbeli. C-O-R-D-A-D-I-A-L-I-T-Y.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:10.480
 What? What's that? What? Chordiality. Chordiality. Chordiality. Chordiality. Chordiality. What's

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:10.720
 that?

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.920
 Chordial being kindness. Chordial being kindness. Chordial. Chordial. Chordial. Chordial. Chordial.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:24.800
 So again, if I simple translate it, good heart. It's better. Very good heart. Good heart.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:38.160
 And then, seven is bodhicap. Seven is bodhicap. So this is how we're going to strengthen our

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:46.640
 bodhicap and how we're going to spreading our love and kindness compared to all the sentient beings

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:55.520
 without any exceptions, without any discriminations. That is the one who's known as, if we do this,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.800
 that individual is known as what? Of course, we all know it's called bodhisattvas.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.880
 Courageous ones for the enlightenment. Courageous for the enlightenment to every living being's

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.320
 enlightenment and courageous to them to get enlightenment so they can do the better service

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.840
 to help to all the living beings. So this is what is, this now seven, I listed as seven,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.560
 seven, and we go over this now a little bit each, each of those points.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:32.960
 First is the motherhood. Recognize the motherhood. According to Buddhism, everyone is being as our

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:40.400
 motherhoods. According to Buddhist teaching, we're not just the first time we came on this earth.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:50.640
 This is the one of the time or a time in this earth. We're born in this earth or this samsara,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.040
 born in the big and less times. Number of times we talk the birth and the samsara cannot come,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:06.240
 cannot put in the numbers. Therefore, in Buddhism, in the Buddha's teaching, it's countless times,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:15.120
 countless times we talk the birth. When we talk the birth, there is a poor means to come

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.080
 to take the birth according to the Buddha's teaching that we all know. And those are again

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:30.560
 our listed. The egg birth, monster birth, warm birth, and instant births. And among that,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:38.640
 monster and instant birth may be different. Instant birth is definitely, definitely not

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:47.120
 dependent with the parents. But egg birth and as well as warm birth are dependent with birth,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:57.760
 truly, with parents. And that means we have to have mother, we have to have father. The parents

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:07.360
 are being instrumental to take birth, our son. Among that, in the Buddha's teaching,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:16.000
 mention always mothers. Because even father is once upon a time, that can also be our mothers too.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.560
 So therefore, everyone is our mother, let's say. Everyone. And mothers, there are also

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.080
 a number of mothers. What the great master Nagarjuna said in the letter to his friends.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:37.360
 And we piled up this whole earth, meant what's called clay, clay, and to put the,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:45.760
 make the bills, bills, the clay, all are completely made as clay. Clay, and that clay we're trying

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:45.840
 to

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:53.360
 make bill, bill as the size of the universe seat, seat and foot, the how many mothers we had.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:02.640
 Great Master Nagarjuna said, art is not enough to put that size of bill to count the mothers.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:11.520
 We have so many time. There's more than that. Therefore, we tell the birth countless times,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.600
 therefore, mothers, numbers of the mothers are common. And also in the teaching, you said,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.560
 how many times we drink the milk of the mothers is more than this whole oceans. And throughout

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.400
 the time, if we put that whole milk in one side, and the ocean is one side, whole ocean,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:42.000
 the how about we drink the mother, milk from mother is more than the oceans. That many we talk.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.440
 So all this is the mother sent in business. Therefore, and then prison the mother.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:56.240
 For example, prison our life's mother. I know mother can't really see, mother is very kindness,

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:03.120
 mother is very, very important in our lives. And kindness, those are a little bit kind of

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:12.160
 sometimes not exactly very suitable statement in modern times. But however, we follow the teaching

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:19.520
 of the Buddha, Buddha and according Buddhism, mother is kindness, mother is very special,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:27.760
 and mother so therefore recognize all the mothers, everyone as mother, and that and throw with our

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:40.880
 dispersion models. So that is the first recognize all mothers. Second is, is remembering the

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.680
 kindness

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:49.680
 of the mothers. Mother did so many kindness things to us, so many things, but again, highlight

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:49.920
 those

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:57.760
 two kindness in the Buddha's end, what it called. First kindness is mother gave of this our birth.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:06.960
 The mother give kindness of the birth, kindness of this body, this physical, this is kindness,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.480
 that mother give. Second kindness is mother's, is mother continue support, give us in a way

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:24.320
 life. Mother extended our lives. So that's the second kindness. Third kindness of the mother is

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:32.960
 mother provided all the necessary things when we need it, when we are helpless. So she provided,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:41.120
 or the parent provided all our necessary things. The fourth kindness is she showed us or parent

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:50.480
 showed us the wall. They become the first teacher. She showed us wall. Those are known as false

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:59.520
 principle kindness of the parents or mothers. Fourth is the mother give us this birth. This

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.800
 life is, of course, according to the Buddha's teaching, we continue that our consciousness

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.320
 continually migrates in the travel of that. But to calm this, to bear at this physical condition

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:18.240
 that what we have is provided by the mother and the parents. With all the parents,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.600
 parent in a dharma point of view, we won't have this et in luxuries of the breakers bodies.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.960
 They are instrumental to give according dharma point of view this eating in domains.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.520
 That's what we talk. The breakers human body is so breakthrough, so important, so necessary. Is it

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:44.080
 a vehicle to cross the organ of samsara, to discover our innate nature of the zogti teachings.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:51.040
 All that is supposed to be prepared and give by the parents, mother. So mother is

00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:02.480
 so kind and so spacious. So first provided that. And the second is she give us lives or the parents

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:11.600
 give us lives. Once we not make it in the womb, mother's womb, but when she comes out of the

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.520
 mother's womb, what we are, we just almost come in one solid, small, small suspicious.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.360
 But don't know anything. Don't know the past. Don't know the future. Don't know even any

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:36.320
 present except the crime. At that time mother neglected us. We have gone probably long term

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:45.760
 and completely gone. But continually supported, parent supported. Hold hands with with the 10

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:53.200
 fingers, holding that our ourself, close to heart, with love, with affection, with joy,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.920
 with the appreciations and keep and every necessary things provided.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.000
 And so we have here the parent didn't do. We long time we gone.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.280
 When there's no more me, no more you, it's gone. The devil is called the kindness of the providing

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:22.560
 the life, this living, this breathing. Our breathing is gone a long time. They didn't support and

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:32.880
 help. We are completely happiness. And so that is the second kindness. And the third is all provide

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:40.880
 all the necessities, everything parent provided to us when we young young and even the best

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.600
 capabilities.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.200
 Best capabilities, everything from the what's called from the diaper, from the dipole and that

00:24:51.200 --> 00:25:01.360
 rubble, rubble is put in. Yeah, what do you call that? All the everything, everything you think you

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.400
 know better than what you have. All these lectures, all these things, they're completely provided

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.160
 everything. Not just only that as from there, then they provide everything what they can do.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:20.320
 According their best capabilities, capabilities and even thinking of the always love and affections

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.680
 and come back. I like to make the best of my district child. I like to do everything. I like

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.800
 to do that and provided that from the kindest store or daycare school to the kindergarten

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.320
 school and high school, everything bought out as like human beings, decent guys and girls that

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:47.200
 because of the parents. That's the code code then the kindness of the providing of the all

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:56.480
 the necessary things to become. And then port is giving them showing the world

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.960
 parents told us mother taught do that don't do that and it's not good isn't that they become the

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.760
 first our teacher helping the supporter so that we can stand strong and firm in a good

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.600
 in challenge of the samsaras and trying to really protect and help and support everybody.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:27.520
 And that's the one called providing old, old like teachings, teachings and showing the world

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:35.200
 exactly that. So those are highlighted this and now this mother sent the beings, beings all this

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.560
 this is not just a mother this time but they did all the every parents in throughout the life

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.040
 throughout the generation of times according to the sitting they did same thing as this parent did

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.120
 and they did that even maybe some better that and this is not just only human beings look to the

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.440
 animal how much they look protect every their best capabilities protecting their children

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:06.240
 they they're children and when you ask those like what's called this penguin penguin penguins

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:14.640
 you looked at how much really I mean so amazing how much they do this they give their birth and

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:22.240
 then mother uh father comes back and then stand on that egg in the blood stream up the core

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.800
 standing

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.280
 there I heard it I mean said in this this is even one second or two seconds went out that egg went

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:38.400
 out is frozen that's how it's holding I'm that sure how much the animal world I'm not just only

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:46.640
 humans everyone protecting health and the support to growth of them that if this didn't mean that

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:53.690
 they don't have have any feelings they don't have any any desires they're completely giving up

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.000
 their

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.160
 everything to protect this is what called motherless sentence beings all this not just at this time

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:09.680
 in the past the past and now what this mother sentence is according to the teaching all this

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:17.120
 everyone is struggling everyone is struggling even even they want to do is wish they do something

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.800
 good but maybe through the unknowingly they are spoiling those things so they are these mother

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:29.280
 sentence beings they're so kind and so spiritual so important me but yet they are in you know also

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.480
 insolent by completely troubled difficult therefore I'd like to really help and support

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.360
 to remove their suffering the difficulty troubles and to get bring them to enlightenment or to

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.320
 discover they enter the natural that with that courage with that commitment commitment man and

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:54.480
 then develop the loving kindness be great appreciations and then compassion that I won't

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:01.840
 talk to but computations and then then good hearts good heart is the combination of the

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:09.360
 combination of the loving kindness and compassion combined together in one central state as a good

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:16.240
 heart with great thought attitude they like to benefit to all the living beings and big did that

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:23.600
 for they will love their body they will love them both each other and then the body cata as

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:34.080
 again with poor boneless boneless love boneless compassion boneless joy and boneless

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.800
 equanimities they will love that and then practice it both each others when that kind of love that

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.040
 body cata relevant from body cata and then inseparable body then after all the body cata as jokin

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.840
 meditate

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:56.640
 so those are very important because it's when you practice jokin we have to be very soft tender

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.040
 heart

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:06.400
 we feel love in a comparison and also we should be very peaceful calm and very what's called very

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:12.720
 humble and it's symbols that is a sign of the practices symbol of the practice so with those

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.920
 understanding and now we go to the heart of the zodiac teachings
