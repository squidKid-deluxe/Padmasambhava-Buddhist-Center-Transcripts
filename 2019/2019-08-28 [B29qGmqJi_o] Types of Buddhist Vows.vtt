00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 Thank you very much. Now we continue again for teaching. Again, we reactivate our visual

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.160
 motivation of the yoga, the appreciation of each other, and also a five-part of the state

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 of our asset. We all are the gracious teacher, bodhisattva devotee, thinking of all that,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.240
 and then we follow the teachings. And as we were talking yesterday, I think we've been

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.480
 talking about now, about the vow itself. When you receive the vows, how that will be, how

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 you take the vows. The first level is, as I said, this vow is known as the "moralities"

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.440
 in the teaching shila, or it is like a simple telling, it's ethics or the conduct. So how

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.000
 we take these vows. And that is then, in the teaching said, is with the thought of renunciation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.700
 thoughts. Renunciation is also best upon devotion and pare, f-a-i-t-h, pare. So pare and ren

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.400
unciation

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 thought, you take. And again, I listed it to others. Those are the like, as the progression

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.400
 of shilas and of moralities, and as well as a kind of higher advantage of the whole, yeah,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.880
 higher advantage of the morality, and those are, the past two are not completely as perfect

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.760
 or the beautiful according to the teaching. The last one is renunciation vow, with the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.800
 devotion or pare, that is vows. When you take the vows, vows, so when you take the vows,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.840
 what are you taking the vows? You're taking of the, of the, that you're not going to hurt

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:10.960
 to anyone, hurt to anyone and know to yourself by the physically and verbally. And how many

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:23.920
 physically to do, and those are known as three by three non-virtues of the, of the physicals.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:34.160
 Those are sexual conduct or sexual misconducts, and then as well as taking lives over others

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 and ceilings. Those are three by the bodhis. Four by the speeches, and lying, slender,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.400
 and gossip, and harsh speech. Those are four, those are known as seven negativities that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.480
 are including all the additional, I like to give up, it depends what kind of vow you take.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.000
 And when you take that vow, and then according again in the different, different schools

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.920
 of the Buddhism, for example, the Vibhachika school, the Vibhachika school is known as

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.120
 Chevraanhava, and Vibhachika school, this is the invisible poems. When you take the vow,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 it is invisible vow, so that means is a poem, F-O-R-N poems. But then all the other schools,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.840
 such as Sri Lanka school, mind-only school, and as well as Madhema school, all the other

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:53.880
 schools, Madheana school, all is mind. It is mind, even though it is connected with it.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.520
 With it physically and actively, it is in a visible way, but when you choke this vow,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.600
 it is in mind. And mind is known as the mind, the determination that you are going to keep

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:16.680
 up that, the determination, and keep up that with devotion or with pain, pain and preserving

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.760
 that with your mind. So except the Vibhachika school, there are all the others, there is

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.080
 slightly different explaining, but it is all mind, it is all mind. And so that is really

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.400
 about the nature of the vowels. Now how many vowels, when you take, how many vowels there

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:48.760
 is, there is, then add vowels that you take. Those vowels are also known as vowels of the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:05:08.200
 timely vowels, and as well as the permanent vowels, timely vowels and permanent vowels.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:26.000
 And this is called, in the Tibet, again our right Tibet, but not that. Dutam, dutam, dutam,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.120
 dutam, and then tam, then tam is the same, then tam. Dutam, do is time. Time is morality,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.200
 it is like abbreviated, cham, so it is morality, morality is all the vowels. If we translate

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:54.000
 it, somebody who vowels. So the timely vowels and then the permanent vowels, so there is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.320
 three categories. Now these three categories, either all of them, how many vowels? There

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.080
 is add, add vowels, or seven vowels. And now I will again list now this one, maybe I don't

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:23.480
 have to write this, first one is, is, is, giune, that when we take the giune practices, giune,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:46.580
 it is called giune, maybe I will write that too. This is finished now, right? And giune,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:07:12.040
 so that is the first. And then giune, giune, and then, and getsoro, and then geluma, getsoro.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:37.640
 And then geluma, and gelluma, and gelluma. Okay, so now this is how many are out? One,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:49.640
 two, three, four, and five. And now this is how it becomes eight. Eight. And that is,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:08:01.240
 this giune is commonly called, I think this is, I mean not this is, giune, giune or giune.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:12.600
 Giune is like timely vowels. How, that is how long we take? Twenty-four hours. From sunshine

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:24.160
 to next morning sunshine. To start, from sunshine to the sunshine. From sunshine to the sunshine

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:34.200
 is known as deutramma. I wrote, I mean earlier you wrote deutramma, means timely vowels. And

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:44.440
 the second is giune, a little bit. In Sanskrit is known as opaskas. Opaskas. So it is Sanskrit,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:56.080
 opaskas. Then next one is getsoro. Getsoro is in Sanskrit, is sharmanara, and in English

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:09.360
 I think novus, novus. Right? Novus. Novus. Novus. And then is geluma. It is between vowels.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:22.760
 Geluma is between vowels for the nuns. Between vowels for the nuns. What? I will tell you.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:33.680
 I will tell you. Between vowels of the, the, the, for the nuns. And the geluma is bhuchu

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:42.800
 is fully ordent. So that is like now five. I mean those five listed. And now when we make

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:50.240
 this ed, I mean not make this, is ed. This is number one. First is giune is number one.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:10:00.000
 You put number one. Giune is number one. Gheni is two. There is male and female ghenis, opaskas.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And in the Tibet, in the teaching said gheni pamai. So that means father and mother or

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.920
 male and female, female. And then getsoro, novus mom is not just only mom, it is also

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:26.400
 for the nun. So novus, male and female. Novus, male and female. That man, phal. First one

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:33.280
 is not really any male and female, guess whoever take that. But is that first one. And second,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:42.280
 third, divide and two, three. So five. And the geluma is for only the nuns, going to,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:51.040
 going to take the full ordination of the nuns once. So it is geluma. That makes six. Six.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:58.160
 And the geluma is buchu. This is not just only male, but also for men and women. So

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.880
 this is called male and female buchini, or the buchu and buchini. Mother and father and

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:19.400
 that all makes the edge. And that edge. Now this is what again in the teaching commentaries

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:32.060
 said too. This gheni is just part of the opasca. Part of the opasca. So you concluded the gheni

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:41.300
 part of the opasca. So not opasca. Yeah, opasca. That's true. Opasca. So this is like as one.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:50.640
 Then if you just put all together, then it's one, two, three, four. Because the geluma,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:12:00.520
 this nun, bit of a nun, nun is like neither opasca nor it is buchuni. So therefore kept

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:12.780
 as one. So all together is four. Four. Now you understand? No. What do you then understand?

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:19.960
 I got eight. No problem. But why are we now at four and why are we doing that? No, this

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:26.920
 is just a way of summarizing. Just summarizing. Just summarizing. That's nothing really any

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:34.120
 other reasons. Okay. Other reasons. If you say that because it's opasca, male and female

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:41.800
 is just opasca. Whether you're male or female, you're opasca. So that's just one. I mean not

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:49.600
 really divided by the male and female. Not what they call it. Not sex oriented. Sex oriented.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:57.080
 Yeah, not sex oriented. Just one. It's one. And the second is the gesso. Even if there's

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:04.240
 male and female, which is novice, male and female. And even though this is just novice.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:13.900
 So again, just put as one. One. So the geluma is then different because it is not neither

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:26.680
 sharpener nor is fully ordained. Therefore, as one independent. And then geluma, which

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.520
 is in a fully ordained, whether it's men or women, is fully ordained. So therefore just

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.640
 put one. This is just way how they make it precisely. That's it. There's nothing else

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:49.000
 really any other reasons. Okay. Now this, when you take this vase, this yin-yin vase, determine

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:59.680
 how many vase you take. This vase, what? Eight. Yeah, eight vase. You take eight vase. This

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:08.160
 yin-yin. Yin-yin is like as a junior in a little bit. It's how ever you use the word. The tiny,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:18.080
 short term wow, or timely wow, or short term wow. Short term wow for 24 hours, eight percent

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:30.680
 that you take. Eight percent. Eight vase. And the geluma, how much you take? Five. How many?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:40.200
 Five. Five percent you take. And the geluma, this shamanar naosma, how much you take? I

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:47.880
 mean, it's all going to tell in a later. So I'm not going to go here now. But geluma,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:58.440
 you take 10 principal vows. But then in the teaching said, even though it is only 10,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.440
 the reality, except only 13 vows is different than the fully ordained monks, or monks and

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:17.600
 nuns. Only 13 different. Otherwise, you take that vows. Ten principal vows. Geluma is when

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:26.120
 you become the naosma nun, then if he like to take the full ordination of the bhukkhuni,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:35.880
 then Buddha gave three years for this geluma vow to kind of like in a way, test the period.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:42.000
 Test the period that whether he can keep up or not. He was able to keep on that. Not is

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.200
 it like, what's called. So therefore, I said, bidun vow. Or maybe it's test the period,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:16:01.600
 it's bidun. Naos, nun, and as well as fully ordained. So she keep that. That has 12.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:11.080
 So that means she keep all those vows of the shamanar naosma, or the nosma, nun. Above that,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:20.160
 she has 12 extra vows that she keep for two years. Once she is ready to take the

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:32.760
 fully ordained vows of the nuns, then she joins to the fully ordained, or the nun, fully nuns,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:49.560
 fully nuns. And how many these nuns have vows? Nuns have vows, fully ordained monks have vows, 253

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.440
 vows

00:16:52.440 --> 00:17:08.400
 of the fully ordained monks have. And 364 for the nuns, fully ordained nuns to keep. So that is

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:23.160
 the number of the vows that you take. And so now, this first two, first two are, again you look

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:36.960
 over view of this first two, among those eight or four, first two are the late practicing vows.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.880
 Yeah,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:46.840
 late practicing vows, which is like short time vows, and as well as of aska. That is late

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:59.880
 practice. Last three, or the last, all this that among the eight, then last five are the monastic,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:09.120
 or the nunary vows. So that is the what, what, how you will understand. And then of course is

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:18.480
 all quite details in a commentary, so you can read, read that, I mean you will bring that, but, so

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:25.880
 then of course also is going to more details later there. So these first two are like the late

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:34.160
 practicing vows. And oh yeah, this late practicing vows, again I think is going to talk here. But

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.560
 late

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:46.520
 practicing is this, this, oh yeah, this, maybe I have to talk a little bit this. The late, this

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.760
 in any practice, you know.
