00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The principal teachings. Principal teaching is Dzogchen teachings. That is what Dzogchen teaches.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 And Dzogchen teaching has two groups, as we heard always. It is called "Tuchu practices" and "Toga

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 practices".

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Among these two, this is "Tuchu practices". That, as the title says too, at the very beginning,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 this is the song of the "Tuchu practices".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And now, "Tuchu practices" is one simple way to tell, is "meditation".

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.190
 Meditation, now, I have to meditate. And in order to meditate, in order to do this "Tuchu

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000
 meditation", the post is "Foundation".

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 That is very important. I am not going to talk too much about these foundations, but because you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.000
 all know,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 Mundo practicing is the foundation practices. Within the Dzogchen practices, also, we had so many

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.000
 times of opportunity.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 We went through this, one after another, those are Rushing practices. Out Rushing, in a Rushing,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 all those practices is the Mundo practices.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.190
 Even though they are so powerful, so special practices, to compare with the Dzogchen practice, they

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 are named as the Rushing practices of the Mundo practice, of the Mundo, of the Dzogches.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.160
 So, but how ever, even we are finishing the Mundo practices, and I would like to encourage those

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.000
 who didn't complete the Mundo practice, please finish that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.190
 Really, make that our resolution, try and finish. This is our practice. We are not just doing,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 driving some extra unnecessary packaging along with our beautiful practices.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 That is the practices. This is the method of Dzogchen. I said the other day, in the Keghiramu,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.000
 there are many times, what Dzogchen means?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.190
 Great completion practices. We completely have everything. We are not solving it out, and we are

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.000
 solving it out.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And we are not really practicing Dzogchen, because we are still all of the Habakhi patterns.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.930
 We are still from the world, the Habakhi patterns. Even when we are in the spiritual world or Dzogc

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.430
he teachings, we still apply our old Habakhi patterns, trying to apply the regulation with our ego-

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.000
cleans, with our duality, with our Habakhi patterns.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.810
 That is not right. We try to release, remove transcendent of the ego-cleaning, duality, old Habakhi

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.000
 patterns.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Therefore, the Mundo is so important. And therefore, when they teach, they always say, "What?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.160
 Even the Mundo has two that we all know. We all know. It is like post-Mundo, and then second Mundo,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.000
 the Prince of the Mundo.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 First Mundo is precious human life. Think of the precious human life. Second is environmental.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And third is thinking of the cause and effort, the result that they have at them.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And fourth is samsara as difficulty challenges. Difficulty challenges. Those are important.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.190
 As I said the other day, if we take that, if we take that, it really makes ourself more soft-

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.000
hearted, more wise, more decent, more common sense.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 It will bring more common sense. And also, practicals. Practicals. That.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.180
 And also, we are not going, that means we are not going to rest in times. Rest in our time, rest in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.000
 our apprentice times.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.190
 Times. And we are going to make something meaningful to ourselves, to others. So, all this is

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.000
 important.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.540
 And for those reasons, every teaching in the teach says, every session, every session this teaching

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.000
 says,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 you must reflect this post-portray of the mind, precious human body, impermanent cause, cause and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.000
 effort, and the result is inevitable, and samsara is difficult.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.050
 And for those reasons, this is, if we have time, for example, not time, we should do, or we should

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.000
 do this.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.660
 And this bed three, for example, in this open booklet, we have this. This is like, this is like

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.000
 great teachings of the past.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.600
 Cause, cause, and shanti deva's teachings. What is it? The foremost, the foremost, sorry. This bed

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.000
 three or bed four, sorry.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 The bed is in bed three, but I think it's in bed four.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.700
 Bed four has opposed the contemplative well, that extremely difficult to obtain, the Venerable Sh

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.000
anti Deva says,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 this freedom and the richness are hard to get, by which the aim of the beings are completion.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 If I fail now to achieve their benefit, how could this great reach ever come again?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.650
 Can't you think of this? We're not just making a false statement and kind of making up these things

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.000
.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Truly, it is so, so rich.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.370
 And how this great Master, Karma Chiang He said, one of the His teachings, that we went last few

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.000
 years ago, in our institute, said,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.190
 among all the six beings, to be born as a human being is very precious, to be born as a human being

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.000
 is precious.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.370
 Among all the human beings, to be born as perfectly, what's called, perfectly all the senses, that

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.000
 we have all the perfect senses.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 It's very precious. Everything senses are good. Our eyes are good, ears are good, nose are good,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 tongues are good, bodies are good,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 intelligence are good. It's so precious. It's not just a chain by accident.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Among all that having, the one who has eaten endowment is so precious.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Eating endowments, all lucky. At freedom, ten lucky. It's so precious.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Among all that even eating endowments, the we have recognized that it's so precious.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 To recognize is so precious. Recognize.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Whenever we have this, maybe we call it, but not recognize.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 If they don't recognize, then we become one. Or, particularly, there may be more suffering.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Instead, enjoying of the eating endowments, more suffering.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.270
 Spoiling that. And then, among even, it says we're not just recognized, but we're using, applying

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.000
 this.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 How precious. How beautiful. We're really taking meaning of our precious lives.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.180
 Think of those, those the great masters said. One of them, it's not just that they said, this is a

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.000
 reminder to us.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Ask what we are, what we have, this luckyness. Therefore, life is so precious.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Life is so special. Life is so important.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 This is a vehicle to get the beautiful goals that will benefit to me and to all the beings.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 To ourselves, to all the beings. We don't this. This is the, we won't go far.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 And so, all these things. And then, of the impermanent.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And also, cause and effort, in the effort of all these things.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Kind of reflect this. And impermanent heresity.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Again, in this great teaching.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Third corner, sorry, here. This is from Buddha's teaching.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 It's Buddha's own home. It's the very form.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Post-coronapolitan wealth that externally, no, this is in the second corner.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Second corner, the impermanent of life that extensively dispels sudarsis.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 The three rains are the impermanent like the clothes of autumns.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 The birth and the death and the wandering is like the views of the place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 The life of the beings pass just like the lightning through the sky.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Passes quickly like the water descending, descending in steep mountains.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 This is how the life is. It's impermanent.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 This is not just making our sad or something kind of funny story or all these things.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Truly, it is like so fragile is moving fast.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And how we look to our lives, how many things have changed?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 How many things have shifted? And how many things are we going to have?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 It's nothing that is called hope. Nothing going to change.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 For those reasons, the great Master, very known as Ashwagosh, very famous Master, he said,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 "Take in the world." He said, "Take in the world, take in the heavens."

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 If you see anyone who's still here that never changed,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 or know your source, or know you heard something, know you dropped something,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 nothing, there's nothing is ever going to last.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 This is what everything is that we are applying to include ourselves.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 For that reason, time is special. When time is with us in all these things,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 enjoy, enjoy the families, enjoy the friendships, enjoy the practices,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 bring more joy, happiness, peace, instead again, worry, this and that things.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Of course, life, those things come. But that's what we practice.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Trying to really handle those situations in Iceland.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 "Oh, I'm not going to allow this. This one, up another. This is the Buddha's teaching."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 "Buddha's teaching, and you did it."

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 And then, in the model of let me have, we do those prayers.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Just kind of this is, when you do these things, it will make ourself, what?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 It is both two things. The British are thinking of the British lives,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 and in parliament, makes ourself more, more kind of practical, not going to rest.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Rest our time. We make time more useful, more beautiful, beautiful.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 And thinking of the cause and effect of a resort inevitable, what it does,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 it will become, our activities will become more powerful.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 No matter how big and small, it well returns back.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 It has cause, it has consequence. It's no matter whether it's good or bad.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Therefore, we start thinking of the cause and effect and result in the inevitable.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Our activity will become more nice, more positive, more beautiful.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So we become very thoughtful.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And we start thinking of the samsara, the difficulty challenge.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 We will bring more open understanding.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 We're not just only ourself that experience the trouble.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Wisely, we're going to look to every direction.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Even though we're difficult, it's how we're experiencing, but we're not going to hold.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 We're not, that's not going to parachute ourself.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Instead, even more courage, more strength, more commitment, more love, more compassion.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 How this happens, therefore, I'm going to do something good things that way.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 So therefore, it will make more openness in the mind.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Open, yeah.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So those all, with those thoughts, now, I mean, ever you can do this.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Because since we are practicing, practicing and we are for the retreat,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 and they have already reflected those thoughts.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 His practice is not just practicing when we're sitting in the meditation.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Always, the great master, Jangul Kundra, Sri Rama, is not just him.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 But always, trying to cooperate every over for our activities with practice.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 For activities, for chaotic routine our activities.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 What are the four routine our activities?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 The other, human beings.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Beings.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Sitting, sleeping, standing, and walking.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Those are the casual, routine activities of the sentient beings, or the human beings.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 This is four activities.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And always, the Buddha Chitji said, "Bjola, naan ghee bhi sui."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Four activities.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Four activities.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 That is routinely we do.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Sit, sleeping, standing, and walking.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 That's it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 We connected that all and for, kind of cooperated that all.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And during the meditation, we did meditate in zooki, zooki meditate.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Meditate.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So that means meditating.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Meditating time, in practice, this period can be, not can be, you can divide into two.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Meditating instead, post-meditation status.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Meditating instead, we meditate in zooki.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Or we meditate on the Buddha, Vigilizing, deity, reciting mantras, so forth.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 That's meditating instead.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And post-meditating.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 It's the second hour after that practice.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And post-meditating, what are we going to take?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 We're going to bring that practice, what we practice, bring it into the post-meditating

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 and at the same time, what are we going to do?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 This always says four things.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 That great master, his holy Dune, said to you, this four, four things.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Remember, the impermanent, bodhicitta, the pure perception, and impermanent.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 That also means, sorry, I should say this, everything is magic, it's dream-like.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Everything is magic, the dream-like.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:30.160
 Compassion and the compassion of the bodhicitta, the devotions, devotions, and then respect and

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.000
 appreciation.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Those four, four are, if we're trying to reflect that, when we are in post-meditating status.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Try to bring those.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 In permanent, that means meditating, that's what I think I joined after the practice.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 This is not just I joined it, but this is a kind of traditional lineage.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And every time session, when it ended, they joined, that prayer is in monasteries.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I joined, after we finished our dream meditation, I joined.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Karma, rabra, manmeti, yuma, sepa, chor, mala, nauticitta, luzi, chun, et cetera.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 I joined it, and we have that isolated.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 This is, can you give me?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Sorry, you have to get up.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 This is the Buddha teaching.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 As a star, as fire rain, lamp, magic display, dew, bubble, drink, lightning, and clothes,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 you should, thus you should see all the condition things.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 That's all condition.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 These are the examples of this.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 These are the odd examples of this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Examples, this is not just an example, chol, riyada level, everything is in these states.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 They call it Buddhism.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Or riyada, really, everything is in these states.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 We don't see this.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 This is everything.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Everything is in a dream.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Everything is in a magic.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Magic is exactly. To remind this in post-meditation, you see this.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 This is not a way we're going to see something sadly, pathetically,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 we're going to see this kind of dream.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 With devotion, with understanding, with thought, it's all dream.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 I'm dream, this is dream.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 I'm just now in the dream status, one of the dreams.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 This is when you start thinking that also it's really helpful.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 If we're doing practice, dream yoga.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Dream yoga practice is always, you can think this, not just that dream yoga is dream yoga,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 but this is dream.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Dream and this is what.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 What that does, what that helps you by doing this practice.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It helps the sharpening of our grasping and clinging.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 It's the brain, exactly where these relatives are.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Relatives are.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 So those are all important.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 With this thought, then we begin to not, I mean, with those kind of beginning ways,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 and then we're practicing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 That's a true practice.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 A true practice.
