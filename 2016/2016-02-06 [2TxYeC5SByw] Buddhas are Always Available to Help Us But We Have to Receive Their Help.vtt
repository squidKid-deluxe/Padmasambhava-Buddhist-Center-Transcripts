00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I asked him how much Buddha and Dara can help me. I said 30-40% is something I already said there.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 And that is the limits of the game.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 So what is generally in the teaching, according to the teaching, the Buddha is helping all of us,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 or as we have mentioned, is the basic continuation of sapantana all the time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 But we will resume that help to us, then maybe 40%, 30%, or even 10% or even 5%.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 That way we will resume that help.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Let's evaluate the example. The sun is shining all the time, for example.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 But according to the situation circumstances, we cannot get light all the time.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Why? It is not the arrow of the sun, the strength of the sun.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 But according to the circumstances of the situation of blood.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Even the sun is right above us if there are thick clothes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 We want the sun only with the light, with daylight.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Similarly, Buddha is the help of the beneficial episode for races.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.350
 But due to our karma, due to our habit dependence of the clothes, we don't receive full power, full

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 benefit.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Because it is our blockage of our karma, our emotions, our obscurations.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 That's what the lady teaching said.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 This is the story also, for example, of a great master, Master Ashinga,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 when he was practicing Magdira for 12 years.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 This great master, Ashinga, he is one of the great masters in Buddhist history.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 He is one of the great fellowships of physics,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 tankers, science, or whatever we call it. He is one of the greatest ones.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And he was created by the Buddha Shakyamunyas.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 But according to his behold, the material, the future of Buddha Magdira,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 he practiced for 12 years.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 During that time, in the two years, he had hardly any good dreams of that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Many times, he tired and bored.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 He just said, "Why this? I didn't see any signs. I'm going to leave this."

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 And finally, he left. After 12 years, he didn't have any signs.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 He thought he would see the Buddha Magdira.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And he was going to ask questions about the Pandya Paramata.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Because Pandya Paramata teachings, I mean, it's not translated,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 but Pandya Paramata teachings, such as big Pandya Paramata teachings,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 there are so many repetitions.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 So many repetitions, one after another, round after another.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 He thought, "What is this? This?"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And I like to examine here what this means.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 The Buddha don't really go there. But he said, "What is this? This?"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So, he asked, "Who will know?"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 He went to the Magdira monk.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Nobody really can tell clearly that he is there.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And then he said, "If you can, only who will know is Magdira."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And they said, "So, I can see Magdira."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 He is pushing to heaven, enjoying the gods of heaven.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 "How can I see him?" He said.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 "No, if you read the instruction, the teaching, practice it, you practice it,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 then you really will see."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So, then he was excited, he read the instruction and the teaching,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 and then he practiced. He went and retreated.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And he practiced there.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 He told him that, kind of soon, he practiced not practicing,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 he will see the Magdira.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 But he didn't see, as he said, for 12 years.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 He didn't see.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And then, he was really tired.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 He was tired, bored. In a way, he was disappointed.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 He said, "I'm going to leave now."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 He left, finally left.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 On the road, he sees one old dog.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Old dog, this lower part of the body is completely rotten and with maggots.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Maggots, right? Maggots.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And many of you know these stories, too.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So, I'm just telling that again.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And maggots.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And upper part of the body is still light.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And as soon as, I think, I put out your clothes,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 she started barking. He started barking.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I think, always, like she, said, "Chimun."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 So, she started barking.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 He felt so compassionate.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Really thought, "Oh, how bad she is so sick.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 She's so terrible situation."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 But yet, he's trying to defend herself.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 He felt so sad.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 So, with his outward compassion, he tried to save her.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 He gave some food.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Food and all these things.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 This long story, let me tell you a few small stories.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 But then, finally, when he's trying to,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 first he's trying to move these maggots.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Maggots, even his teachings.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 He cut his own part of flesh, body,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 and then he's trying to move them.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 But he can move easily those maggots.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 He don't like to kill also maggots, too.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Maggots, he like to move.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 He started thinking to move by the finger,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 but the finger is too hard for the maggots.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 He thought he was going to move with his tongues.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Tongues, even though it's bacteria and all those things.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 But he didn't care, I think.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 So, he closed his eye and he started moving,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 trying to move that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 When his closed eye started moving by the tongue,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 he said to him, "That tongue touched to the ground."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Then he did again, kind of like that.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Again, the tongue touched the ground.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Then he thought, "Why is this?"

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 He opened the eye, and there is no old drug.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 There is no, this female maggot, that, right there.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 The material is just glowing there, glowing there.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And then he jumped to it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 I said, "Jaunt to material."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Material emberist.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 He said, "How are you?"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Unkind, uncomplicated.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I tried that long.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Even the reformist side.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 [laughter]

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And then materialist said,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 "I was there the first day you came,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 but you didn't saw me.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 I was there all the time."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 You never saw that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Today, why you saw?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Because of your power, your compassion.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 You saw me.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 You call that whatever the block, whatever that is,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 removed by the compassion that you have.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 That is what you see.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And you take me to the, you take me to the,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 we go to the villages, see, they can see me now.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So they went.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 We're talking.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 In the teaching said,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 met, ascended carried on his shoulder,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 and they went, and he asked the village,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 "Do you see anything on my shoulder?"

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Nobody saw anything.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 He said, "What is great man?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 What is talking?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 You can see something."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 One old lady saw again one dog,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 kind of a dog that he's carrying.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 He's carrying.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 That's what he saw.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 So these are just examples of this,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 that lady in the teaching said.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So I just thought to tell that great man.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Thank you.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Thank you.
