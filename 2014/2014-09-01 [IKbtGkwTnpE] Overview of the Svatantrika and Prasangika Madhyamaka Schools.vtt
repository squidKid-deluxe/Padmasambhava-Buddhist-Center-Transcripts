NOTE     "synopsis": "On August 26, 2014 at Padma Samye Ling during the 2014 PSL Shedra Philosophy Retreat on \"The Radiant Light of Sun and Moon\" by Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche taught an overview of the Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamaka Schools, otherwise known as the Middle Way Autonomy School and the Middle Way Consequence School.\n\nAt the beginning of this video, Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche mentions Mipham Rinpoche and the Nyingma School's division of relative truth into 1. pure relative truth and 2. impure relative truth. Pure relative truth is how enlightened beings and bodhisattvas experience phenomena, and impure relative truth is how ordinary sentient beings perceive things.\n\nIn the Nyingma tradition of Mipham Rinpoche, the Svatantrika are defined as \"followers of Madhyamaka who teach by emphasizing the categorized absolute involving assertions.\"\n\nAccording to the Svatantrikas, there are two kinds of impure relative truth: the correct and the incorrect. Correct impure relative truth refers to phenomena that are undeceiving in terms of their characteristics, i.e. able to perform their particular function. For example, fire, which is hot and burning. The incorrect impure relative includes phenomena which appear yet do not function as they appear, such as the moon\u2019s reflection or a drawing of a lamp.\n\nThe Svatantrikas divide the absolute truth into the conceptual and nonconceptual, which can also be referred to as countable and uncountable, or categorized and uncategorized. Svatantrikas make this division to help sentient beings gradually approach the direct realization of uncategorized absolute truth beyond all conceptualization.\n\nIn the Nyingma tradition of Mipham Rinpoche, the Prasangika are defined as \"followers of Madhyamaka who teach by emphasizing the uncategorized absolute that is free from all assertions.\" Prasangikas use consequentialist arguments (Skt. prasa\u1e45ga) to refute all relative positions and thereby establish the ultimate truth of emptiness beyond all conceptual elaboration.\n\nEnjoy!",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 Truths are two truths. Then I added one more as in the Nyingma teaching, always said, so it's true.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 Of course, the classification of the two truths is the truth of the appearance and emptiness.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 And then the truth of the way things are appearing, way things are appearing, or that means

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:36.160
 way a relative truth is appearing. That also divided into two truths. And the appearance

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.480
 of the duality mind is relative truth. Appearance of the, like beyond the duality mind or the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 personal mind, that is the absolute truth, the simple way to tell that. So this is two truths.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.520
 But again, we go back to the two truths itself, and that is now. And within that, again, this

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.440
 classification of the two truths of the emptiness, appearance, also where things are in the world,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.640
 divided also to other more subdivisions of the relative truth in the two categories,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.280
 and absolute in the two categories. And that is generally, this relative truth in the two

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.800
 categories is where we think, see. There is something that we see, commonly everybody see,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:36.240
 and something that we see when we are defected our organs, organs or hallucinated our also mental,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 we see things. So this is what called the six senses. That means six senses or six organs,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.080
 six senses, six organs, when it's diluted, we see things, but that is not seen by commonly

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.530
 everybody, everyone's, everyone's. So that is that, that object, that object and that subject both

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.240
 are

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.720
 as false relative truth or wrong relative truth, wrong incorrect relative truth. And we use those

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.400
 examples, which is also a true truth. And then these two truths, again, these

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 classifications of the absolute truth, divided into two. This is particularly this way, is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.960
 particularly techniques of the, sorry, Swatantar Madhima schools, Swatantar Madhima schools. This

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.200
 is

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.840
 technique, is Swatantar Madhima schools. And what the difference between Swatantar Madhima school

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 and the Prasadu Madhima schools? What is it? You remember what I said, or you, I read in the book?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:06.640
 Yeah, one is, is the Swatantarita is, is they negate everything? What? They negate everything,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440
 that they don't have a specific view that is direct.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:33.360
 The Prasadu Madhima school. Oh dear. They have more, one is, one is gradual and one is direct.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.080
 Right. That's true. That's true. Okay. Laura, you have some.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.120
 Prasadu Madhima school will accept whatever is said by other people on the relative level.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.960
 But when it comes to the absolute, they'll refute what is said in the Garjuna quotes, you know, I,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.080
 I don't have a particular view, so therefore there's nothing to argue with. And then in,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.520
 in the Swatantar, Swatantar Madhima school, it's more gradual. They use, they use, they talk about

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.360
 relative truth in a way that points to absolute truth. They use countable and incountable absolute

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.320
 truth as a way to. That's, that's true. That's exactly. And so this is again, and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:30.800
 what the distinction between, again, these two great schools, this is that it's not something that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.160
 has on the, on the, on the reality or the absolute truth is not something that has two different

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:48.720
 things, but we individuals are having realizations, how they can relate to that. And that is then

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.880
 Prasadu Madhima school immediately goes to the absolute truth, which is free from all those

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.080
 extremes immediately to that state, pointing out that immediately, that that's it. That's it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.840
 Beyond everything. And then anything position takes by others. They refer to that on the,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.080
 this is absolute level. Again, it's not on the relative level, they refer to that. On the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.560
 absolute level, they refer to that. And that is as yesterday we went. Prasadu, for example,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:31.680
 for let's say how the birth is taken. Birth. That means how seeds developing the result,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:41.280
 or the effect, how seed develop. Seed is the cause and an effort is resolved, or the seeds

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.960
 develop. What's called this sprout is resolved. Resolved, how that developed. On the absolute

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:57.440
 level, they said, there is no birth. No birth. Immediately, they refer to that. Then even,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.920
 even not seeing the absolute level, there is no birth. Says there's no birth. And that is what we

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.680
 joined in a, in a Heart Supper, the end of the Heart Supper. Nagarjuna's quotation, as I read

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.560
 yesterday or the before. What he says, "You gracious teacher Buddha, taught there is unceasing,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.720
 unborn. Immediately he went to the absolute level. Nothing mentioned about any division of the

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:35.200
 relative, absolute, anything. Unborn, unceasing, and so forth. One after another. Immediately

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:45.680
 he went there." But this is the apparatus of the Prasadu Madam School's, the Apparasadu Madam

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.400
 School.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:56.480
 And the Swadu Madam School used that, used that as a stepping stone, stepping stone. And you see,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:06.640
 in absolute level, there is no birth. Used bring up the absolute, there is no birth. That indicated

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:14.640
 on the relative level, we have the birth. That they're accepting that. Relative level. And Prasadu

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.400
 Madam School never mentioned anything. Immediately jumping, going to the right to the target.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 Target to the natural. No birth. There is no birth. Yesterday we discussed a little bit, really,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.840
 birth. When we said birth, birth, of course, when we thought investigating, analyzing,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.440
 it's fine. As great Master Chantalakte said, it's very comfortable. I think there's really,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.800
 we have to say, it's appealing, nothing. All comfortable, appealing, it's just, it's just

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.640
 peaceful. There's nothing. There's no reputation or the debate of arguments at all needed. That's,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:07.520
 it's fine. But when we'll start looking, how birth is taking, how producing the seed,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:15.920
 producing the result, when we're looking, when we ask that questions, then there's only four ways

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:25.920
 to take the birth. Birth, we put that. Self, other, both, neither. There's no any other.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:38.730
 Others. So we have to bring up some thoughts. Oh, it's coming from self. Oh, it's coming from

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.200
 others.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.120
 Oh, it's coming from the self and others. Oh, it's coming from nothing. It's just coming.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:54.320
 Have to use that. And each of those use and then it's not correct. Correct. It's not natural.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.520
 Naturally, there is contradicting cause. It's not, it's, those are the Mademos school,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.480
 those who have brought, that is, of course, we also, it's not just, yeah, Mademos, not just only

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.000
 brassica, Mademos school, but also Swatan, Mademos school. We just come to the absolute level.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.160
 They use this logic too. How this coming? Coming. If it's coming from the self, then we say, yes,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:30.080
 try it. I'm teaching say, teaching say that there is only two ways, two things have come from self.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:38.960
 Then there is what the purpose of self is already there. I mean, what the benefit is already there.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:47.120
 Self is, means the individual, self is self. There's no change. Self is no change.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.520
 So that's not, not false. The second, the second is self. That means it's independent.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:05.280
 There's no need in the assistant, others. Then going to come so many, endless. Why is it stopping?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:13.120
 For example, when cause develop the result, there's not endless. It's just one spot

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.440
 comes. But every self, then, it's just there's no need in a self-concented condition.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.640
 Others, of course, they, it's continuing to come. And let's come.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:36.480
 So those are the repetition they used. And then others too, say only. Other means others.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.920
 Different. Then there can be anything other can be. There's a food in there. If others come, then

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.760
 again, everything can have to be wiped out. Sporters have to follow with the cause.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:59.680
 Since there's other, other can be anything. They use examples of, from the fire could come, water.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.520
 And from the light could come, darkness. And what is other? Light is different than the darkness,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.120
 darkness is different from others. And the sense is coming from the others, then can be any of

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.360
 those.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:26.480
 And then for both, it's both repetitions, repetition force. And from nothing, then again,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.840
 again the same thing. If it's coming from nothing, that means why? Then everything

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.600
 not going to come as a flower of skies. Never going to see anything. If it's not coming from

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 any cause and condition, it's like skies. Or maybe there's always that. Since there's nothing,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:57.280
 need anything, then all the time. So those are when you use logic, when you use reason,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:05.040
 when you use intelligence, can I just, if we look exactly what it is, then it comes like that.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.720
 But then what is, mademos or the reality? Then that is what integrates it. It magically comes.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.280
 This is called, it's all entered by the co-ordination. It's just illusion level. It's

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:31.680
 all arising, magical comes. Magically arising, medically transcendent. It's all relative truth.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:41.040
 Truth is all magical. Medically arising. And I think if we start looking to the, to the point,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.760
 to the source itself, is there's nothing substantial existing. That is known as the emptiness.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.920
 Where appearing things come is co-operation. Not just by one or the same, this and that.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:02.080
 It's co-operation of many things. Arising this is, that's called tint and revolution in

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:11.760
 the buddha cicis, in the Tibetan. It means as magically magical. The way coming is magic,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:20.080
 way to co-operate. Everything is magic. To grow one's sprout. It's not just sit alone, develop that

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.320
.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:29.360
 It has so many conditions of invoke. To bring up that sprout, what we see small green, green and

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:40.180
 big in the dark. That is so many conditions that we don't intersect at all. So many, all co-

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.920
operated.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:49.920
 And all are interlinked, interlinked. And all are also harmonized in a way. They join together,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.400
 together. In each of those are also magic. There's no substantial solid resistance.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:04.480
 It's all. That is how it is. So therefore, Prasad Gomadema goes immediately to there

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.560
 without using any kind of like conduct, or in absolute level there is no birth. They're not using

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:19.840
 anything there. And Prasad Gomadema's school then use. In absolute level, there's no birth.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:28.000
 Or no birth. Such use. That. And again, Prasad Gomadema's school is going beyond everything.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.720
 That means the existing, non-existing, either and neither, cause anything. And Prasad Gomadema's

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:45.600
 school using, as I said, step and step, there's no birth. So in absolute, you can catch something

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:53.200
 in our mind. Mind to hope, or there's no birth. And then you investigate and analyze. Analyze,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.080
 and it's true. True. And then you kind of hold that. That is what it's called. To hold in that

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:08.800
 things. That, that will in the mind. That's called countable absolute truth. Countable absolute

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.120
 truth.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:17.360
 Then, when you got that realization, Swatana Gomadema's school, even that no birth thought

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:27.760
 is not existing. No birth thought is not true. That is grasping, clinging, and beyond. Then,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:36.080
 lead to them. Then, exactly as Prasad Gomadema. Beyond every aspect. That is known as

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.800
 incountable absolute truth. That is the absolute truth. And so, therefore, there's

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:51.920
 two truths. In Prasad Gomadema's school, countable absolute truth, incountable absolute truth. That

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:51.920
's

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.120
 what they do. And then, in Prasad Gomadema's school, it is incountable absolute truth,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:06.080
 immediate truth. That happens. So, that is like, again, really, I think, you catch something?
