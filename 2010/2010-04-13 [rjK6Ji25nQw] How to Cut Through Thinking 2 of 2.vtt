00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.280
 Generally, when we are talking about this two practices, duality, all this is generally

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.360
 speaking about social practitioners, it is a very beginning practice. This time, thoughts

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.840
 are disturbance. For the beginning times, thoughts are disturbing, it is stabilizing,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 it is destabilizing the meditation and our practices. Therefore, we really don't need

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.160
 to follow the thoughts while we are meditating. That is what we need to cut. But when we have

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.760
 little bit of stabilizing meditation, then we should not see thought as enemy or thought

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 as obstacles. Thought is display. Thought is display, thought is always teaching, say,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.560
 the ornament of the rupa. Rupa, it is good, it is intelligence. Therefore, it is not something

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 that we have to avoid, nor cannot avoid. Thought is the wisdom, intelligence, ornament, and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.360
 that should not, even they say, don't block that, trying to stop that. But if we are grasping,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.320
 clinging on the thought, then we are creating the habit of evidence. Then it becomes disturbance.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 That is the force we should really understand.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 And then also we have to think, this practice, we have to think in a more practical way. We

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.640
 have two things, meditation status and the post-meditation status. Meditation status,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.000
 that is the word we should not try to avoid the dualities. We should avoid the dualities,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.680
 we should, that is the technique we use in the meditation status. During the meditation,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.800
 any of those public activities, attachment, grasp, we really let release that immediately,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
 trying to relax in the natural state. So thought does not become the duality, but thought

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.360
 does become the ornament, and that means it let us come, let it dissolve, and the duality

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.400
 is not manipulating of the display in the movement of that. Then it is called ornament

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.520
 of the rupas. That's the word we should make. But then in the post-meditation, of course,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.520
 we should make plans. We should take this and that, but we need to do for us. We should

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.000
 not do what we can. Definitely we have to do. We have to do, we should not avoid this.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.040
 So all these, our plans, this should take care of the mundane world in the post-meditation

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.030
 or at least anything that records very practically and very reasonably and without too much

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.480
 emotions.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:37.200
 That's the technique. And then the presence, like the body, all this devotion, joy, everything.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.120
 Those must be connected, connected during the post-meditation or as immediately, then

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.080
 apply our mundane world and show some review of the strength of the practice in meditation

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.240
 state, through that in the post-meditation state. So then this mundane world does not

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.120
 completely spoil our whole practices and then keep up the identity and the quality of the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:14.200
 practice. That's not the issue. Then this old technique is coming from the Buddha's

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:32.320
 teaching is from the alaya. And alaya is that, where is this alaya? And alaya is that, or

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:44.120
 mind, mind. And where is the mind? It is then, where is the mind? And then the Buddha said,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.520
 majority place is in the heart center and is the principal office, the brain. That's

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.720
 what the Buddha said. So then that could be both, both. And the modern time they said

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:11.040
 the brain and that is the majority office, brain is the major office. But mind is not

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:19.800
 brain and brain is the powerhouse of the mind. And that's what the scientists said other

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:30.440
 time. Last year I went to get snips of the sin. And there they are talking, all the scientists

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:40.840
 said that the mind is not the stop, stop. And the brain is stop. I think S-T-U-F-F, I

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:49.600
 think, stop. Mind is not the stop. Brain is stop. And the mind is even before this stop,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:06:00.400
 that's what really this is. Yeah, mind is even before this stop, that's what they said.
