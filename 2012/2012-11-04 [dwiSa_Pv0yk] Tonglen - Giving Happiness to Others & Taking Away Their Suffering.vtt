00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.540
 "Tonglen practice is that even others are more important than ourselves. And with that, or myself,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:21.050
 dahi yamba and dahi jiva, and dahi jiva, dahi yamba means we are equal, we are all equal, dahi jiva

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 means exchanging our situation as it is.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.750
 And dahi jiva, dahi jiva means others are even more dear than my own son. That all is added to the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.160
 bodhisattva, according to your capabilities and duties that you have.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 There are so many beautiful stories of this dahi jiva that even others are more dear than our son.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.620
 There are a lot of stories of our great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni's former lifetimes, that how

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:03.060
 many times? He exchanged his own life to bring the joy and peace to others, others more dear than

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.160
 himself.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.360
 In the teaching said, one time, the Buddha Shakyamuni was born as king, known as Bhimaji, or the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:21.260
 lord of stone. In his reign, big disease came, and he tried to cure those diseases, and he called

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.160
 the doctors many times.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.970
 And he called the doctors, and doctors said, there is nothing that can help this disease except one

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:41.600
 fish, fish. And the fish is called ruhita in the teaching said, nya ruhita, nya ruhita meat will

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.160
 only help to cure the disease of this, disease of this.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.580
 And the Buddha taught, how I can do that. He told, now that means, I am going to become the nya ruh

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.160
ita. He said, I am going to become that fish.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:08.180
 He said, in order to save all these beings from these unquirreable diseases, may I born as the fish

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.160
 ruhita, in the cholung dozi, river dozi, river.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 And he jumped from his bodies, and he jumped from his bodies, and as his wish, he was born in the n

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.160
ya ruhita.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.530
 In the teaching said, then nya ruhita called, everyone, those who like to cure the disease,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.160
 sicknesses, come to me, take my flesh, and my flesh.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.050
 And then Prabhupada's king came and told his flesh. In the teaching said, the upper part of the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.450
 body is cutting those flesh, and then he turned up to collect more, in the other side, flesh comes

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.160
 back, back.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.930
 And through that way, endless, everyone woke. And everyone been so kind, and so, so appreciative,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.160
 so appreciative of this fish, how what I can do.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.580
 He was such a great king, now born as like this, and a cruel disease, and then he said, I don't

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.760
 need anything, anything, but all do ten virtuous practices, ten virtuous practices, and that they

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.160
 did, in the teaching said.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.970
 And then there's another story, again, in the story that, I mean, there's many, many beautiful

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.160
 stories like that.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.830
 How Buddha gave as many lives to the other beings, really. And one time, again, I mean, in the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.940
 ocean, in the teaching said, that again, Buddha, these martians went to the ocean, and the ocean is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.160
 completely carpeted, and this Buddha was born as like big sea turtles, sea turtles.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.100
 And then, and the Buddha said, come to me, come to me, hold to me, hold to me, I will tell you the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.160
 same shows, same shows.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 And all the martians or those goers on the boat came to the big turtle in their hold, all that hold

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.160
, that title, and ocean drive, and the show.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.140
 And then Buddha, that turtle brought everyone to the show, show, and after that, the turtle had

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.160
 been so tired in the teaching said, he falls asleep in the right, that ocean, show.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.310
 We need to fall asleep, but when we wake up, wake up, there's 80,000, 80,000 symbols, or the air

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.090
 sectors, I think, in the symbol get up and the teaching said, the biting him, biting him everywhere

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.160
.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.580
 He thought he'd go to jump to the river or ocean, but he thought, oh, if I jump this whole time, I

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.160
'm not going to jump.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.340
 This is my time to use my, this body. I use this life so many lifetime without any purposes, but

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.160
 this is the time I'm going to use, this something benefit.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.100
 But when I'm going to dedicate this merit to becoming enlightenment, when I become the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.160
 enlightenment, may I can share my natural, downward teaching, force to this, this being.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.150
 And then the Buddha take and say, that's why when Buddha give the rich enlightenment, enlightenment

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.980
 at first time, when he start giving the post teaching in the Sarnath, Sarnath, the poor noble truth

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.160
, five human beings, 80,000 selection beings, 80,000 selection beings.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.270
 This 80,000 selection beings in Buddha say, there are those who are biting him, and because this

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.160
 God is going to hit the dead as it, pass these teachings.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.030
 Those all are stories. All are the stories and that all are the teachings. How powerful, how

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.160
 important, how special to do these exchanging practices.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160
 So yeah.
