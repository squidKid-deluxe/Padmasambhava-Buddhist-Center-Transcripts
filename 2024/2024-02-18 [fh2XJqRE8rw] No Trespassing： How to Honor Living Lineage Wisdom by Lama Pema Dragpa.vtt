00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.280
 Welcome everyone, near and far, known and unknown, here and now and long into the future, always

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.720
 so special to get together, to connect with and absorb the meaning of the Dharma, to wisdom

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.440
 and compassion of the lineage masters and the living nature of our own intelligence,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.200
 to kind of really activate that, refresh that living vitality of Dharma right here, right

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.800
 now. Thanks for coming together to do this, you know, with one another and with yourself

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.120
 and in your immediate environment. So as we've heard so many times, and it's always part

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 of a central kind of component, the rigorous kind of bedrock of any time we ever study

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 or practice a Dharma and trying to really be like living experience all the time, actually,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 to reactivate these three motivations, the Kemper Rinpoches and all these lineage masters

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.080
 have emphasized again and again. Those three are renunciation or joy and appreciation,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.480
 then bodhicitta, heart mind of enlightenment and pure perception, kind of seeing pure body,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 pure speech, pure mind. So these three essential points bring together the three yanas,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.240
 foundational

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.800
 Buddhism, Sutra Mahayana, Tantra Mahayana with this very genuine kind of gratitude and have a fresh

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.440
 kind of wakeful appreciation of like how many amazing things that we have in our experience

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.400
 right now, all the things in causal history that have led to this moment for us to be here and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.560
 breathe and enjoy and have our sensory things function. There's just such an infinite list and

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 that we have Dharma, we have a complete path to enlightenment, we have this beautiful nature,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 we're kind of step by step brightening that nature like so many reasons to be joyful,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760
 thankful, really try to turn that on.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.360
 Then in addition with bodhicitta, we all want to be happy, no one wants to suffer,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.880
 it's kind of the visceral experience of all of us wandering beings, constantly trying to be happy,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.240
 trying to avoid suffering, it's just kind of such a tender-hearted experience

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.960
 to be a wandering being, always trying to get something from outside. So with this tender

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.720
 heartedness, kind of see we're all in this same boat, all as wandering beings, so I will kind of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.000
 connect to my own goodness and the goodness of others to fully awaken, fully become enlightened

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 and thus like really fully helpful, fully capable, fully responsive in embracing the vast

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.360
 nature of how many beings there are, of how vast this universe is, of how big reality is,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.440
 I will become that vast and that's skillful to be with it exactly, perfectly, beautifully,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.240
 elegantly, kindly. This bodhicitta motivation, try to really turn this on.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:04.320
 Then in addition, this pure perception, this kind of heart of Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.920
 not so much seeing everything as a prison or a world on fire or something wrong and broken

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.600
 and needs healing or to be fixed, some stain to be removed, instead seeing that kind of natural

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.240
 goodness, that like shining bright kind of brilliant quality of everything that's happening

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.040
 now, of all of our experience, of this world, of each other, try to really kind of connect with

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 that,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.920
 like rest in that, that courageous view, deep dignity of your own goodness, kind of turn on,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.680
 like kind of connect with and just very bravely kind of connect with that goodness in all beings,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.120
 those right around you and this environment we're in, so pure land. So we're buddhas in a pure land

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.120
,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 this is kind of the mantra happening and then everything is just kind of this enlightened

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.760
 wakefulness or knowing quality, this kind of wisdom mind, so we try to really activate that.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:33.440
 [silence]

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.120
 So we have this brief window to reflect on, contemplate the teachings of

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Rinpoche, these lineage masters, all the way to our own personal

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.680
 teachers,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 Venerable Kempa Rinpoche's and the other great wisdom masters that we've encountered and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.120
 have a personal connection with, taking this brief time to kind of really highlight Dharma

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.680
 teachings

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.150
 that we've kind of heard and have the opportunity, the great fortune to receive and reflect on them

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.200
 really kind of chew them, digest them, kind of really get a kind of more kind of squishy,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.640
 kind of connected experience of them and like really transform, to really try to absorb them,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.010
 to have us align with Dharma so that we're living Dharma, we're in alignment or attunement with

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.280
 kind

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.240
 of a natural system which we're already a part of. So we have this brief little window to do

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.120
 that together before then we'll specifically kind of manifest and relax into this living lineage

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 wisdom ecology and the Dajjum Teresarnandro with Guru Rinpoche, all the buddhas and bodhisattvas,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.280
 arhats, the great Ettarukas and all the Dharmapalas, Dharma, Dakinis and Dakas will kind of relax

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.400
 and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.800
 rest and do this practice together. But first we'll do kind of a little brief kind of reflection,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.120
 kind of just kind of sizzle our attention to a specific little corner of Dharma.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.240
 And the corner that I thought to do is actually interesting one, don't know where I'm going to

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:56.750
 really go with this, it's called no trespassing, how to honor living lineage wisdom and not break

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.880
 it.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:05.680
 From outside or within, no trespassing, how to honor living lineage wisdom and not break it from

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.600
 outside or within. It's kind of popped into my mind a few days ago, it's been something I've been

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:28.960
 thinking about a lot. No trespassing. It's helpful for me, I have like some Dharma teachings that

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.720
 I'm going to refer to and then just kind of like weave together some things. So from my mind, this

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.600
 is really hard. I have a really tricky wandering mind, always kind of looking out and kind of with

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.680
 a kind of genuine enthusiasm and care for the Dharma. Really deep, I have deep love for Dharma.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.760
 But I also have very small tight vision of what the Dharma is, like to funnel to all kinds of

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.720
 layers of ignorance, small mindedness, all kinds of emotional obscurations and things.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.560
 So when I kind of contemplate questions about kind of the lineage continuing,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:16.080
 then my mind can get more tight, more judgy. So something that's been helpful for me,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 something that Eric Pemakunzang said, he said to me once, it was really helpful for me.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.960
 This is just like a person always said to me in person, he said,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.200
 we don't have to worry so much about other people doing things wrong or not

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.080
 and get preoccupied by that. I would suggest that you leave out those things and just shine.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:49.040
 We don't have to worry so much about other people doing things wrong or not and get

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.760
 preoccupied by that. I would suggest that you leave out those things and just shine.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.560
 That line, amongst other things he said, really helped me. I've come back to it so many times,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.320
 it's kind of like a strong point. I think this has a lot to do with preserving lineage wisdom.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.640
 Just really connecting to our own goodness and just shining,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.320
 like connecting to the goodness in others and just appreciating it,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.720
 appreciating the shine of others and just kind of basking in that.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.280
 Like deeply celebrating and caring for kind of all the beauty

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.200
 and the kind of like unique kind of different ways that we all kind of make sense of

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.560
 this whole life death thing.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:44.480
 As a basic orientation, that's really been helpful for me and at least helpful in the

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.000
 sense of as a reminder, keep pulling my mind back when I get too concerned about some samsara thing

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.000
,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.600
 something going wrong.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.160
 As if the Buddha nature doesn't know what's the next step. You have to kind of figure it out.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.360
 Our wisdom really has this knowing capacity to really trust that,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.280
 connect with that first and kind of really let that shine.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.280
 It's a deep trust and this is all about preserving lineage.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.160
 Like a point that's also been helpful for me is to distinguish between a view

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:33.120
 and then a world or an orientation, an approach and then actually an ecology.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.960
 So in Tibetan Buddhism, we have these amazing teachings

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.040
 in this nine yana system according to ningma school and it's always taught as a fundamental

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.840
 kind of principle that these, in terms of the path, we always have a view, meditation,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.640
 conduct and fruition. These three or these four always come together as a harmonious whole.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.240
 I will call that an ecology. It makes a world. The view is the first one, tawa,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:12.000
 an orientation and an approach or a worldview, a way that we orient to experience and then

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.480
 interpret

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.520
 experience, what we see, what we don't see, how much we see, how little we see, how we read it,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.560
 how we make sense of it. That's a view, a worldview, not just some dry sterile scientific

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.520
 at a distance view, but the lived experience of how all of our sense doors are operating,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.600
 they're always funneled through a view or a worldview. So that's one. But then there's

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.760
 meditation, conduct and fruition. They're sustaining that worldview, that view,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.480
 integrating with our daily lives and also in our sadhana formal practice.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.520
 And then the results that come from that with having this cause and conditions set up,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:54.160
 we have a world and what happens with the world as it continues to be sustained. This is always a

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 complete ecology, view, meditation, conduct, fruition. So the point here is there's a

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.560
 significant difference between the view and then sustaining the view and integrating the view and

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.480
 getting the result of being in that world space. A middle way approach is one thing, but actually

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.280
 stabilizing the middle way approach where we actually live it in our experience and over time

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:26.880
 develop living connections, living roots, living relationships based on a middle way view with the

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.920
 texture of a middle way view that's like really permeating and saturating our experience. We're

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:40.960
 like living in a middle way world. Flash orientation, shine on view now is one thing. It's the key

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:48.640
 principle thing we do every single moment. We always turn on a view. Question is which view?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.160
 In Tibetan Buddhism, the view required is a middle way view. This is for Tibetan Buddhism,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.760
 have to have the heart of bodhisattva, have to have that heart mind turned on as the bedrock

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.840
 orientation of everything, otherwise everything else is wrong. The view is wrong, then naturally

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.040
 the meditation, conduct, and fruition are wrong. So always up to the practitioners to check in

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.840
 real time right now with mindfulness, what's my view? How's my heart? How's my dignity? Then you

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.440
 have to sustain that and we're sustaining that. That's where we use all these different techniques,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.400
 supportive conditions, skillful means to help us sustain a view, the middle way view or a tantra

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.280
 maha yana view. And then as we do that and sustain it longer, we're integrating our usual daily

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.440
 activities, talking, walking, sleeping, lying, standing, all the things. And gradually that

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.480
 becomes an ecology, a world. How to not break a world, how to not break a middle way world,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.880
 how to not break a tantric world. Principally, this begins with the view I'm holding. What world am

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.040
 I

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.840
 in? That's where kind of the responsibility and accountability of showing up in an ecology in the

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.600
 world always begins with me. What view am I in? Which actually means what world am I in?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.920
 This is kind of a very deep point.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.480
 Then there's different things that kind of popped in my mind with this. This is kind of a little

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:22.640
 bit

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.600
 of a random kind of assimilation of kind of like things that have touched me. Instead of like I

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.080
 know some, a lot of people aren't really into the kind of dry mechanical lists of operating manuals

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.560
 of the sets of three things and five things and 10 things. And in general, you know, people want to

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:38.560
,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.960
 I mean, I see this in my experience. We want to be swept away a lot more than explained.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.880
 We'd rather have like a sweeping atmosphere that kind of like we can surrender to than like

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.640
 actually have someone explain the living mechanisms of how that works. That tends to be the true in

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.320
 my experience with my own mind. I'd rather hear a beautiful song than have it explained like why it

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:07.440
 works. So I'm kind of pausing all the kind of mechanistic third-person so-called objective

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.440
 scientific languaging a little bit. Now I get to go with more like free flow intuitive feeling

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.480
 because that's what people are asked for. Then we'll see if I can do it any good. But one thing

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.720
 that popped in my mind is Kemple Rinpoche. I remember when I was here at Palmasami Ling early

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.480
 on, maybe about 2004. We were in a room just over here and it was a little room

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.760
 size of about four and a half feet by four and a half feet, maybe five by five small little room

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.920
 here. And Rinpoche said to me, "Oh, do you know what we at that time it had shelving things with

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:46.800
 dishes and different soak utensils and things for big feast offering ceremonies?" And Kemple

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.360
 Sanandanya Rinpoche said to me, "Oh, do you remember? Do you know what we are initially going to

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:51.520
 have

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:59.080
 this room be?" "Oh no, I don't know Rinpoche what?" In the center of this room we are going to put

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.360
 a

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:09.760
 giant prayer wheel just with a chair. And then it would just be someone every day can sit here

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:17.920
 in this chair and spin this big prayer wheel. And he said to me, "You don't know how much I would

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:26.880
 like to just sit in this room and spin this prayer wheel." That really struck me.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.840
 This is a giant three-story Tibetan Buddhist Gompa.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.280
 After escaping from Tibet, after being hunted over the Himalayan mountains, the Venerable Kemper

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.840
 Rinpoche's with their mom, dad, two sisters, they made it almost with nothing. And look what we

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.000
 have

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.790
 now. This big temple, 500 acre retreat land upstate New York, big temples in Florida, retreat

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.120
 center

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.720
 in Florida, temple in the kind of rural retreat in Nashville and Tennessee, temple in Puerto Rico,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:10.080
 monastery in Sarnath, miracle stupa in Sharasti. All these different Sangha members spread

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.320
 throughout

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.150
 the world. All these books, all these translations of so many sadhanas, all these things that Rinp

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.440
oche's

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:27.840
 have given us. They built this world. And the thing they'd like to do, Rinpoche would just like

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.760
 sit in the room, spin a prayer wheel. They're like this giant offering they've given to us

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:43.520
 with their Sangha. And not just us, these people flesh and bones, but all these beings,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.840
 every time you ring a gong before teaching, inviting all the beings of the universe, anyone

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.440
 interested to come show up. Rinpoche's are setting such a gorgeous elegant table for us to come and

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.040
 just all we have to do is show up and just respectfully, kindly just enjoy the beautiful feast.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:09.280
 Be in that world and relax. They're not doing these things for themselves. They're really serving

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.680
 beings and they're showing us how we can do that too. How do we serve beings and how do we get in

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:23.400
 our own ways where we kind of make it all about me, the prison of selfishness. As soon as 17 Karm

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:23.440
apa

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:34.560
 refers to it, the prison of selfishness. So how can I be in this beautiful world? What there is,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.600
 this mandala, this Vajrayana world, or just the world world too, biological world, you know,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.480
 on and on. There's so many different worlds because there's so many different views.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.800
 How can I be in a world gracefully, elegantly, lovingly, kindly, carefully as a steward,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:57.800
 a custodian, as a genuine humble active participant and not break it, really care for it however

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.080
 much

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:09.600
 I can. How to do that, you know, is a really relevant question as so many worlds come together,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.520
 as we have access to so many worlds and we can create them very quickly now too.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.720
 Because the mind is just creating these views all the time.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.680
 Another thing that struck me is Kapur Rinpoche recently in his winter retreat,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.160
 teachings from Florida mid-January. He made a point, I think it was maybe first day,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:36.400
 maybe third, I forget. But it struck me and I could tell it struck the people in the room too.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:43.120
 We saw it here at Padma Samanthi, another webcast. Rinpoche said, "During people's busy lives,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.480
 when they're working, they seem to like really make a lot of time for dharma practice.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.600
 But oftentimes when they retire, they also retire from dharma."

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:04.480
 And the point was around impermanence.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.880
 As we get older, closer to the point of us dying, it's really good to put a little more

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:21.440
 extra emphasis on dharma, on love, compassion, wisdom, on kind of activating, kind of being in

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.200
 the quality of those natural Buddha nature kind of outreaching display. It's even more important

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:34.160
 to do that. Time is running out. Don't try to leave the world then. Leave this world,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.600
 this mandala of love, compassion and wisdom. But how can I like flexibly sustain that?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.000
 There's a lot of different ways to be in a world in an ecology. It's not a one size fits all

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 experience. This is not a dogmatic, doctrinal, authoritarian, overly centralized totalitarian

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.640
 system. Buddha dharma is flexible. Buddha always met the view of the viewer and used whatever

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.520
 is available to have the viewer relax so their own internal intelligence could shine on more.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.160
 Their own Buddha nature could relax and confidently, naturally kind of extend its brightness,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.960
 its aperture, its connectivity, but it never forced anything.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:25.520
 We don't want to leave the world early. That would be like breaking.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:36.000
 Breaking, breaking such interesting thing from His Holiness Dilgo Kensa Rinpoche in a letter

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.480
 he wrote, His Holiness Dilgo Kensa Rinpoche. You shouldn't go for teachings that move mountains,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.720
 your inner kundalinis, your channels, or gain enlightenment in one lifetime immediately.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.280
 Though these teachings are esoteric and powerful, are you ready for them?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.360
 Being ready takes decades of practice, so you have to be sure. I know of people, quote,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.200
 doing higher tantra practices for the last 15 years and gave up and just went back to hedonism.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:14.000
 They weren't ready, it turns out. Instead of applying fundamentals, they ran for the sky

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.680
 and just fell down to earth. This is not the fault of the dharma, but of our impatience,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:30.480
 ignorance, and sometimes arrogance. The thing with Nanyana's system of view is like these

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.150
 high-level views of Zogchen and inner Tantras, they include the more foundational lower level views

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.160
,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.200
 like Four Noble Truths that Urbache is teaching us in the centers on Sundays.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:49.040
 Five aggregates, 12 links, six paramitas, these bedrock dharma teachings, bedrock meaning always

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.840
 important, always essential, always the fiber, the living connective tissue, the heart, the beating

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.680
 heart of every single practice will do. If we don't really put the time into like really

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.200
 saturating ourselves with these core root first principle, bedrock deep, deep level teachings of

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:14.320
 the Buddha and just instead go for like very kind of like flashy or like kind of swept away in the

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.160
 movie story without actually applying the user manual intelligence, how does this actually work?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:30.080
 Why does this work? If we just want to be swept away and we don't actually want to use our

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.480
 intelligence, our prajna, to really learn how it works, why it works, what's my mind doing,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.960
 oh my mind's changing now, then I need to change a technique, I need to meet this technique that I

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.880
 receive from the lineage and align it properly because that's what my view is doing right now.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 If we don't do that kind of bedrock core nutritious exercising work, work or play,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:58.800
 then challenge will reveal the weakness, challenge will reveal like our usual default mode

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.520
 as challenging times

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.800
 and we've committed to like really keep showing up for all beings.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.880
 We have that heart commitment and this is a big long view.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.840
 This is not this just going to happen this week, this life, all beings be enlightened.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:27.280
 We might be in a view where all of a sudden we're no longer in some sark mode and they say like

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.320
 these buddhas and bodhisattvas, when they are in this mode of inner tantra vision of Mahayana or

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.320
 like that tantra Mahayana zogchen vision, they can't even find suffering anywhere.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.200
 They search through all these universes, they can't even find a single iota of suffering.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.520
 If we get in that sudden realization mode, then we have so much

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.200
 alivening energy to be with other beings who don't have that mode.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.040
 They're not turned on that way, they're not relaxed and natural that way.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.080
 We'll have even more energy to be with them instead of just escaping into my retreat,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.000
 my mantra accumulation, my day watch in straight highway.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.640
 Day watch in is not a way to get out of samsara, it's a way to actually like be

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.360
 more carefully and lovingly with beings in samsara.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.360
 It just speeds up the process so we're not kind of causing as much trouble for

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.680
 ourselves and others before we can actually help them.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.960
 This is not like an escape hatch, that would be breaking the ecology.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.040
 It would be its own version of trespassing.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.840
 So it all comes down to this view, why am I in this?

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.320
 Why am I doing all this buddhist stuff?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 Am I doing it to feel better?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.800
 That's a genuine question, sometimes I am, do I just want to feel better?

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.880
 Am I doing it to get a better position, a better future?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.200
 I'm suffering so much now, but if I do some dharma practice, it'll make it better later.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.160
 Am I doing it just so I can be out of all this trouble and mess?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.360
 All this suffering, this ongoing pervasive suffering.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.680
 Am I doing it because I'm right?

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.200
 Because I know, it's emptiness, I know this.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.000
 So the great Manjushri told Sachin Kunganingpo, these are all worldly views.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.680
 If I use dharma just to feel better, or I use dharma to have a better samsara position,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.320
 or I use dharma just to get out of samsara for myself,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.360
 or I use any view to reify that view as if it's the final word.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.700
 If I do a totalizing mode, these four graspings have to be given up by serious dharma practitioners

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:44.880
.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:51.760
 This is a really strong statement from Manjushri that I really take seriously

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.920
 because they create worlds, those are all worlds.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.200
 I want to be happier, that creates a world where I orient, that's my goal,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.840
 I orient towards achieving it.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.920
 There's a whole view, meditation, conic fruition of that goal, that view.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:14.400
 Am I doing it just to get a better rebirth, upper realm rebirth, or just to escape the cycle?

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.600
 Am I doing it just because I think I know?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.160
 Because all these ways, they won't work.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.560
 That's why Manjushri is so kindly telling us, none of these work.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.520
 If we're trying to do zogchen or tantra, Vajrayana, they fundamentally,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.680
 it's not the right view to be in that world.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:38.160
 We won't actually be in that world, the zogchen, or like the pure view world,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.720
 which is a big problem.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.280
 Because if we think we're in that world and the decades go by,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.440
 but then we actually haven't ever been in it,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.510
 or maybe we were once, or occasionally, or when the time is right, or on the beach, or whatever it

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.720
 is.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.920
 If we're not designing our experience to be resilient enough to deal with challenge,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.000
 with out of the box kind of ways that I can't control,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.080
 then we're using dharma to not be with life.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.680
 We're trying to use the dharma to go around life, escape life.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.560
 So many communities and people and all that have talked about it, spiritual bypassing.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.880
 It's not a new type of topic, spiritual materialism.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.800
 But am I doing that?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.080
 Just because it's an old topic, like, you know, a 2600-year-old topic,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.080
 it doesn't mean I'm doing it.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.440
 Am I doing it right now?

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.080
 These are like really practitioner questions.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.600
 "Dhujum" is only as sorry, as only as "Dhu" can say "yangzi rambachae."

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.840
 He once said a few years ago on Facebook,

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.800
 "I hope you continue your practice and dedication to whatever extent you can.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.200
 Please don't become opposite of what you practice.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.400
 Don't become a dharma hippie, a teacher-shopper.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.040
 Nowadays, so many teacher-shoppers go to every teacher, every empowerment and puja.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.640
 Please don't waste life like that."

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.920
 Collecting dharma experiences.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.120
 He continues, "Our Asian people like more ritualistic pujas.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.640
 Sort of powerful things.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.320
 We intend to do less practice.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.560
 Now I would like you to divert that. Less ritualistic, more focused-on practice.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.840
 That's the quintessential basis of everything,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.200
 what Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Rinpoche did and what our teacher is doing for us.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.760
 Please no longer forget this at all times."

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:36.880
 These great masters, really, you kind of like shining lights on these kind of ways

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.480
 that actually help us get out of trouble, like these Samaya guidelines.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.080
 We're getting to a local, living ecological system.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.120
 Following the guidelines of the system, actually paying attention to,

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.200
 listening, like, what is the river doing?

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.720
 What is the soil made of?

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.480
 What are the bugs here?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.680
 Like actually giving time to actually see,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.000
 how are the living relationships happening here?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.680
 Because now I'm here in this world.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.320
 How can I be with this world, kindly, lovingly,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.440
 the whole boy scout, girl scout, like, leave it better than I found it kind of thing?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.440
 And Salinas Karmapa said, "You can't become a good Dharma practitioner

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.640
 if you aren't a good person."

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.600
 How can I be a good person?

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.920
 That's a bedrock, Sheila, morality, ethics,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.680
 whatever you want to call it, gentleness, Sheila, sultrum.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.520
 I need to first be a good, decent person.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.760
 A really good person.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.800
 Have kindness, you know?

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.160
 I can't be, it's not possible to be a good Dharma practitioner

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.120
 if you're not a good person.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.640
 You might perform like you're a good and like put on a nice act.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.640
 But when times get tough, the act, it falls away.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.760
 Then we really see what we've been doing, you know?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:05.520
 And it doesn't have to be so complicated either.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.480
 How to just be with things in a kind of way.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.200
 In this book, "Pith Instructions from My Teachers,"

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.840
 James Gritz is a compilation of different

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.600
 pith instructions he received from his teachers.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.480
 This is a beautiful book.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.360
 I've really already gotten a lot out of this book, actually.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.640
 In it, he gives his talks about encountering His Holiness, 17th Karmapa.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.120
 Over the years, but also at one point during his first,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.480
 or kind of some in 2002, page 159, he said,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.040
 the author James Gritz asked his Holiness, 17th Karmapa,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.320
 "Is it possible for a householder to attain enlightenment in one lifetime?"

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.840
 And his Holiness, Karmapa replied, "It is not something impossible.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.720
 It is said that if you practice, then you can accomplish liberation at home.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.960
 So this is very much possible.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.080
 The most important thing is exertion.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.880
 Your diligence is your participation in whatever you practice.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.600
 "Dharma practice is mainly dependent on getting the point, or not.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.680
 It's nothing more or less.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.960
 When you get the point, you get liberation.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960
 And when you don't get the point, you miss it.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.960
 So it is not that difficult.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.840
 The most important thing to do is supplicate the guru

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.720
 and supplicate the lineage and open your heart

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.000
 to receive the blessings of the guru and the blessings of the lineage.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.760
 Once you have those blessings, then attainment of enlightenment

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.080
 in this life is not really a difficult thing."

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.600
 This is so pithy.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.520
 This is so beautiful.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.400
 It's so beautiful.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.120
 The line that struck out to me at first was,

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.800
 "Diligence is your participation in whatever you practice."

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.200
 How much are you willing to really be with it?

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.320
 In one way, more technically, we could think of this as sustaining a view.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.240
 How much am I really actually willing to be in a world?

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.400
 Be in a world of bodhicitta.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.080
 Be in a world that everything's maybe pure.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.400
 Everyone's a Buddha that's around me.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.280
 Maybe I'm a Buddha.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.760
 Everything that's happening is just enlightened energy happening.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.360
 How willing am I to participate in that, to sustain that view?

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.440
 That's so beautiful.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.040
 And then he says it's so simple.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.720
 You connect with authentic teacher.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.400
 They're basically boundless wisdom and compassion.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.120
 You, yourself, your nature is boundless wisdom and compassion.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.120
 And you align with them.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.080
 You have developed trust where you can align and really let that mingle.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.840
 Their wisdom mingle with your wisdom.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.920
 And in that space is the mandala, is the ecology, the living world.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.680
 So the living lineage masters and your own Buddha nature come together.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.360
 It's very simple, actually.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.320
 That's why I say guri-yoga is the indispensable practice for zogchen people.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.800
 Mingling your mind with the wisdom minds of your teacher and the lineage,

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.960
 going all the way back to the Gurumbhuche and the Buddha.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.080
 This is the essential pit practice.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.000
 Brings together all the other instructions.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.640
 Your own wisdom mind.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.080
 Mingling with the wisdom minds of really fully awakened beings.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.560
 All the skills available to help your mind, your heart open up,

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.560
 wake up more brightly, more vividly until finally there's no more awakening to do.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.440
 Just like boundless.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.040
 And then what do we do?

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.040
 We actually care for ecologies.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.640
 We care for our relationships.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.680
 We care for ourselves.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.320
 We don't keep causing trouble for ourselves.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.360
 That's called renunciation.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.720
 Give up the cause of suffering.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.320
 We genuinely love all beings.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.920
 They have Buddha natures, bodhicitta.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.200
 We see the natural goodness of all the systems we're a part of all the time already.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.120
 These ecologies are already integrative.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.600
 They're already internested, interlinking, interlocking ecologies of wisdom and compassion

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.200
 and of samsara ecologies too.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.840
 They're already integrating.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.200
 They're already communicating.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.400
 They're already kind of reciprocally kind of interfacing with one another.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.280
 How much are we willing to actually listen?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.440
 Stick around in a spot and actually learn from the spot.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.480
 Learn from the ecology.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.600
 Be in a world and actually like humbly, creatively,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.320
 interestedly, like energetically learn from it.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.840
 Be with it.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.160
 Not try to game it.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.960
 Manipulate it.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.920
 Try to control it.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.800
 Try to make it mine.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.160
 Try to prove something.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.680
 But actually like just be with it.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.040
 Participate.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:48.160
 Otherwise, we're trespassing in any way we are.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.360
 We just take our view.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.480
 Push it on anything we are.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.600
 That's always trespassing.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.200
 That could be trespassing at the DMV.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.920
 Trespassing in a grocery shop in a relationship.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.200
 It doesn't have to be a Dharma thing.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.440
 But if we come into a context where the bedrock state,

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.840
 wherever the bedrock view is, like say Borichitta,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.040
 if we come into the context without Borichitta, we're trespassing.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.880
 And then the bar raises as kind of the view gets more refined,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.520
 meaning more natural, more inclusive, more comprehensive.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.480
 More just kind of like naturally, kind of like inclusive of reality.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.160
 Then if we have to align with that, if we want to play in that space

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.480
 and learn from that space, there's not another option.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.680
 Otherwise, we're trespassing.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.000
 And the thing is, on the bedrock kind of humble reality of it,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.800
 most of the time, I'm trespassing.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.560
 It would be very arrogant of me to say I always have Borichitta on

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.080
 and pure perception on and all that.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.400
 Because then it would just be I don't have that.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.840
 So I have to know when I'm doing that,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.360
 when I'm breaking something, I'm not aligning.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.880
 I'm not surrendering. I'm not attuning.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.200
 I'm not having my own wisdom kind of show up.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.880
 I'm just covered in my little box.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.360
 And I'm taking my box approach and basically banging it against life.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.600
 Because it's very painful.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.400
 I know it. It's really painful.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.880
 And the beauty of syncing up with an ecology

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.640
 is the ecology is already integrative.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.800
 We don't have to piece together each little part.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.560
 All these systems of interdependence are already communicating with one another.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.640
 They're already responding to each other.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.360
 We're already in it.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.120
 Our body's doing that.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.240
 Our emotions are doing that.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:34.480
 It's just we have to get less tight around one select kind of slice version

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.120
 of this very narrow filtered version of a view.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.440
 And then we have to instead of demanding all the world fit into my little box,

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.960
 I actually have to relax that, loosen that, flex that,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.120
 clarify that, and be with the living ecological dynamics

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.120
 inside, outside, self, other, quiet, big, gross, subtle.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.760
 And actually learn from it.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.200
 And learn with the undulation, the movement of the dynamical systems of interdependence.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.720
 And that's called the path.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.040
 And there's not a one time done.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.040
 It's really it's very involved, very participatory.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.280
 Like Iselina said, that will determine whether we can get enlightenment in life.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.520
 How much are we willing to participate?

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.640
 To really absorb it, be with it, be in the world.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.440
 Creatively co-create the world.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.200
 Not be against it or not just be flattened by it, but be with it.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.680
 Show up creatively with it.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.280
 The Buddhas want us to join in and help beings.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.760
 They're not asking us to just sit down and shut up.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.640
 They're asking our prajna to turn on.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.000
 Our bodhicitta to turn on.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.520
 Our creative talents to turn on.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.480
 And we stop kind of like kind of closing ourselves with our limitations and obscurations.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480
 We just kind of try to put that stuff down.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.400
 This burden is not necessary.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.920
 We keep doing this to ourselves.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.760
 And Buddhas are so kind.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:02.720
 And then the practical reality of actually kind of having this flexibility of mind,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.720
 this middle way view that's being sustained, is we actually have to grow it somewhere.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.480
 We can't just keep moving between ecologies, between worlds.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.280
 It's called wandering, groa, sentient wondering.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.320
 We actually have to root it somewhere.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.800
 Otherwise, we're just like McDonald's going everywhere.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.760
 Or Home Depot.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.320
 Or pick a thing that's like has so much power it can basically go anywhere it wants,

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.560
 bulldoze the ecology, and set up shop however it wants.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.920
 This is not living lineage anything.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.680
 It's not ecologically sustainable.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.000
 It's basically we're taking power and breaking anything we want to, oftentimes very recklessly.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.680
 And we can do that.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.080
 Doesn't have to be some big transnational corporate thing.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.800
 We can do that just making everyone have to agree with my story.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.120
 My truth, my feelings.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.320
 That breaks it the same way.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.360
 We can do the exclusivist thing and say only this way of Buddhism is correct.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.480
 I'm the purest Buddhist.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.560
 That'll break all the other versions of Buddhism.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.080
 We can do it in some fundamentalist version of Buddhism.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.440
 Say you have to be Buddhist in order to get enlightenment.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.280
 That'll break a lot of Buddhism too.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.760
 There's a lot of ways to break this thing.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.520
 There's a lot of ways to actually not be flexible enough and hold a middle way view.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.960
 These are called extreme views.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.200
 We really there's all these systematized things.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.480
 Very detailed teachings we can study by the Buddha to show all these ways of emptiness

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.320
 functions that we're kind of not allowing for because our views too tight.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.280
 And if we refuse to study it and instead we want a pith instruction that sweeps us away

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.880
 and somehow magically this whole magic pill thing.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.680
 Somehow we can have a blind faith theistic swept away by the blessings.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.160
 The Buddha never taught that.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:46.960
 That's theism.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:55.440
 How do we have our own wisdom mind connect with other wisdom minds in a wisdom mandala

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.600
 where we're all highly participatory and we're learning and listening and flowing with each other.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.600
 It's not a surrendering squash yourself and let just all the power of something

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.960
 flood over you as if you're like a nobody and you don't matter.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.760
 Each of us matters.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.720
 We all have Buddha nature.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.680
 Every moment is so critically important to use Borichitta to uplift.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.280
 So then as a final kind of plea to not have Buddhism become a new franchise.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.960
 Which Buddhism there's so many Buddhisms.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.160
 And even in authentic lineage Buddhism Nanyana system there's so many Buddhisms.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.280
 It's all view dependent.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:44.240
 Then in this book poison is medicine which my wife Amma printed out because she liked it so much.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.160
 It's a free e-book download download by Zoxar Kenseter-Miche.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:56.480
 And page 81 is a section on the two truths.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.920
 This is so interesting.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.680
 This is really related to our topic.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.960
 Zoxar Kenseter-Miche says it's like mid book you know.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.160
 This may be why so many Western people appear to value the ultimate truth more highly than the

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.640
 relative.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.440
 Buddhists don't make that distinction.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.720
 It's not how Buddhists think.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.200
 The Dharma neither looks down on the relative truth nor up to the ultimate truth.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.280
 Not because they're equally important.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.920
 But because neither exists.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.640
 Both are mere tools.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:39.840
 The survival of the Buddha Dharma not only depends on a thorough understanding of the

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.520
 relative truth and the ultimate truth.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.360
 Perhaps ultimate truth or absolute truth is better translation.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.400
 But it also depends on the recognition that the point of distinguishing relative from

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.720
 absolute is an educational tool.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.320
 Not a reality.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.240
 I'm skipping ahead.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.920
 To a Western mind relative truth can sound like an allegory or a parable that was made

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.200
 up to illustrate a point.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.280
 Whereas absolute truth usually sounds like the real thing.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.480
 But as the Buddha himself explained both the relative and the ultimate are simply made up

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:16.960
 stories.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:26.800
 Go ahead.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.600
 Eighty five.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.680
 Buddha Dharma's built in flexibility is one of its greatest strengths.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.960
 It would be such a shame if Buddha Dharma were concretized to such a degree that it

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.640
 became just another franchise.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.920
 All its individually crafted tailor made paths would have to be dropped in favor of

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.600
 predetermined formulas lists of rules and an unbending curriculum of strictly regimented

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.400
 skillful means.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.440
 With the contents of the past set in stone Buddhism would become a kind of spiritual

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.000
 Starbucks.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.320
 No matter where in the world you buy your Starbucks coffee you know exactly what you

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.040
 will get.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.800
 The taste never deviates.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.520
 If you ordered a Starbucks caramel cocoa caramel cocoa cluster Frappuccino blended

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.120
 coffee in gang talk you will it will taste exactly the same as it does in Guadalajara.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.400
 Starbucks coffee is the safest of safe bets which is exactly how I would define the

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.840
 franchise mentality the safest of safe bets.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:30.800
 But how does making safe bets help us on a spiritual path and how safe can any of us

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.360
 really be.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.640
 Buddhism must stay true to its uniquely versatile approach and that means Buddhist

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.360
 teachers must have the freedom to tailor a student's path to suit the student's needs.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:49.040
 It has to be a living ecology between teacher and student between Sangha the Dharma has

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.400
 to be alive it's naturally versatile and flexible if it's tantramayana it's the

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.920
 middle way it's bodhisattva yana it's the middle way so we have to always engage with

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.520
 a light touch and awe and wonder we're in a living ecology and we can learn from from

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.480
 it so much it's not just that the ecology has to learn from me and we're always part

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.520
 of larger systems whether we see it or not the world we're in is always larger than us

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:19.760
 so we have to be with it we don't have to enforce it or control it we have to learn to be with it.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.320
 So all these ways are kind of ways of participating with instead of trying to push against or lock

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:26.720
 up

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:32.960
 or fix or franchise or an otherwise kind of break living ecologies and the buddhadharma

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.640
 is no different buddhadharma is just much more fragile because it actively involves

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:45.520
 all these living views of living minds living hearts it requires the active ongoing participation

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:52.880
 participation of each mind to like intentionally be in a certain view that's the kind of ongoing

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:59.280
 challenge for buddhadharma practitioners and then in that view in that world with other beings

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.560
 sharing this view trying to co-create a world together be in a mandala and kind of use the

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.280
 juicy juicy kind of messiness of human experience and all our obscurations and emotional and ups

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.240
 and downs and moods and all the things how to really use that as a way to kind of like encourage

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.480
 and brighten our vodhicitta our connections and in one way our surrendering to the wisdom

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.040
 mind of ourselves and our teachers we need to surrender our egoic i'm the most important

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.960
 person in the room habit surrender to the wisdom mind that doesn't make preferences like that

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.520
 and it doesn't see absolute truth as some other thing and it doesn't say the relative is just

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.600
 who cares absolute is this other sure thing and the relative all these relations and ecological

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.000
 kind of inflows out flows ups and downs soil composition things they don't really matter

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.480
 because in the end is just of all just relative truth actual buddhas don't do that they don't

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.800
 prefer one story over another they're with the ongoing story that they're already a part of and

00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.560
 never forget it's always a part of a much larger story and it's always made up of infinite sub

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:11.040
 stories always so flexible so that's kind of my one way long kind of winded little ranting

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.880
 kind of highlighting kind of pin ping ponging between buddhist points of these really great

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:21.680
 trustworthy amazingly kind of authentic lineage masters we can rely on their words and the more

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.080
 we investigate their words their teachings their instructions their guidance their atmosphere that

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.280
 they create the more we'll actually see that it actually is living wisdom mind and how will we

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.080
 see that we'll actually have our own wisdom mind turn on and it'll be able to resonate more with

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.680
 other wisdom mind wisdom heart we'll kind of really be so thankful we're a part of such a

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.520
 amazing living mandala and then we'll pray like each of us that we can keep this connection

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:53.680
 forever like keep caring for this connection and honoring kind of all the deep juicy relational

00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:00.720
 kind of like networks and kind of mutual bonds co-creative agreements and kind of just loving

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.360
 kind of like connections and understandings we have with each other to like really have this be

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.800
 the most kind of nutritious kind of flexible appropriately flexible kind of environment and

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.040
 set of ecologies for all the beings we come across to kind of recognize their voyage to

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.920
 and love them and have compassion for them like skillfully kind of kindly engage with them

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:32.720
 thank you thank you

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.320
 thank you a quick final little wrap up

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:47.920
 i really love you all i mean honestly i'm like really so concerned like how can we all keep

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.840
 coming together stay on the path support each other it's such a big long lovely view for all

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.840
 beings we're committing for all beings whatever it takes and to like learn the skills and the

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.960
 flexibility and the attunement the appropriateness the sensitivity to really align like

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.200
 what's available here what's going on here to listen and like slow down kind of line up with

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.160
 the pace of a living circumstance i mean that's really kind of where this inquiry is coming from

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.680
 like how do we really do that how do we kind of how can we really be with these living ecologies

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:28.880
 because it's really the swift path instead of building something one by one i mean there's just

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.520
 all these ecologies of practice of study of these wisdom mandalas they're already happening

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.040
 and they're already synced up with each other and they're in folding and inter unfolding like here

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:47.360
 and throughout space and if we kind of like let ourselves get buoyed up by that wave that surge

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:55.440
 of all these dynamic kind of inter this dynamic relationality of these ecologies of these mandalas

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.960
 then all of a sudden we can accomplish all these things at once we can just really go with the kind

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:09.440
 of surging kind of flow of all these lineage masters they've kind of already done this revealed

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.680
 this and the kind of these natural systems are the way they are it's a swift path but then when

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.440
 things come up for us sticking points where our mind kind of locks up we get scared we get tight

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.800
 certain kind of subtle things surface and kind of we close off or numb out or escape or over it

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.040
 just

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:31.040
 all the ways that we can basically try to escape experience that we need to also know some of the

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.600
 nuts and bolts of dharma so that we don't always just have to kind of like rely on being swept away

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:43.040
 and kind of up leveled by an atmosphere but like when that freshness kind of like dims when that

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.600
 kind of we get flat when we get in these laws which are natural parts of systems like to have

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.840
 these kind of low level low energy times where we kind of just restructure ourselves um then what

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:59.680
 can how do I know dharma well enough to kind of reinvigorate that fresh connected immersive

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.960
 experience of being with the dharma and that's very clearly emphasized in Vajrayana practice

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.840
 it's why Vajra pride is so important to let ourselves really confidently surrender to or

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.080
 like clearly see that this is a wisdom mandala we are an enlightened being or kind of according to

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:24.320
 the very specific ecological patternings of that mandala according to that set of sadhana

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.440
 instructions

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.880
 we can like line up with that set of instructions with great confidence and that just means we can

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:40.320
 really carefully powerfully be in that world and not bounce we're learning to actually keep showing

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:47.200
 up in that living ecology of a sadhana practice for example and then all of a sudden like great

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.400
 realization and great kind of heart opening mind clarifying can happen really quickly because

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.200
 those wisdom and dollars are already happening both inside ourselves and around us and with others

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.760
 and

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:04.960
 we can kind of use that mutual kind of benefit to like serve beings more fully right now so um it's

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.760
 really kind of a gesture of love and also kind of a kindness to myself to remind you know this is

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:09.920
 not

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:16.480
 the first time someone's had to figure this stuff out or these these worlds already are there it's

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.840
 more a question of us kind of clearly tuning into them and kind of like carefully like intellig

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.120
ently

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.080
 lining up with them and maintaining that living kind of vivid connection with them as we continue

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:42.240
 in a really paced rhythmic way on the path for the benefit of all beings so thank you thank you

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:52.240
 you.
