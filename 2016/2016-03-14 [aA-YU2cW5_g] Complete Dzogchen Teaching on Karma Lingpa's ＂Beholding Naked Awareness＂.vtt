00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [music]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 [music]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Again, good morning everyone. Welcome again. It is one of the according Buddhism,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 according to the lineage teaching. This is one of the great, joyous moments in our life.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 We explore the teachings of the Buddha, the essence of the teaching of the Buddha,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and Dzogchen teachings. This Dzogchen teaching is not something that outside,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 the other side of the side, we're trying to focus that. We're looking to our innate nature.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 We discover our innate, beautiful nature that we didn't discover so many lifetimes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Today, we're discovering that teaching by the gracious teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Gaurabha Masambhava, and all the lineage masters are pointing out, "Hey, you have the treasure.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 This is your treasure. You should revert beyond that. Don't neglect that.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 That is what it is. Therefore, it is so special. According the lineage, according the teaching,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 according the spiritual seeking that we like to make change in the difference in our lives,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.290
 this is what it should be. This is therefore, we should bring more joy and appreciation, more

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.000
 grateful.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.430
 Grateful. This is not something that we call accidentally because we are so powerful with these and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.000
 that things.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 But truly, we are connected to this teaching, calmingly connected with this teaching,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 and this is what the teaching is. So therefore, bring joy and appreciation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And we're great, tremendous, grateful, these things.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Same time, according to the teaching, according to the Dokjin teaching,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 according to the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, we are doing these practices,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 not just for only ourselves, but for all the living beings.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Bring them joy, peace, happiness. Remove their suffering, their difficulty, troubles.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Whatever they are going through in their lives, all the life after.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Really, truly, what we are going to do, truly explore, make this benefit to all those beings

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 as a ripple effect, bring them to their innate nature, discover their innate nature.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 They're not just completely lost to the destination and the direction.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 We find their direction, discover their innate nature.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Kind of reaching sincerely at the bottom of our heart, and that is known as in Buddhism, bodhijata.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Remember, you know this. Bodhijata is, again, I think something alien,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 strange things we are trying to be. It is our nature. We discover.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Actually, Dokjin teaching is the essence of bodhijata teaching.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Dokjin is the embodiment, essence of the bodhijata, and bodhijata is love.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Bodhijata is compassion. Bodhijata is wisdom.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 That combination, all that holds some quality is dokjin teaching.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 So therefore, we should start right now. Dokjin is not something we're playing a game in the future

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.000
.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 We're going to discover right now we should start.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Number one, or when we started with that, then we move the expanding,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 growing the deeper, stronger, and higher, and then move forward.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Makes it joy, joy for ourselves, joy for all the beings.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Therefore, bring more joy and more bodhijata.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 At the same time, also bring a little more kind of understanding, beauty in nature.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 According to Dokjin teaching, according to the higher esoteric teaching of Buddhism,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 entire universe is already enlightened, awakened status.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 That means we are already enlightened, awakened status.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Only what is blocked, our dualities, our duality, publication of what we created,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 that blocked the reality, the face of the natures of that.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 But reality, it is pure that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 So today we're trying to discover that nature.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Therefore, kind of a little bit of open our heart toward that direction of the purity,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 understanding.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 All is everything is quite purity state.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And Dokjin teaching often said it's a medalla or the circle of the three kayas.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Dharmakaya, sambhokaya, narmakaya status.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 We are in that state, universe is in that state, everyone is in that state,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 no one is out of three kaya status, already enlightened qualities.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Bring that nature, again bring that light in our kind of state of mind.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 It's all known as a practice.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 We are really, not just a state, all the time,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 myths of the duality and kind of publication.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And all these kind of like cold and dark and iced states, all the time.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Bring that light in the warmth of our heart and mind.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And that is known as the hallmark of the practice.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 It is a practice, we are practice.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 We like to make the change and the discover and the change ourselves,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 discover our own nature.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 That's what we are here, actually, explore that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 So therefore, all those are generally known as the foundation

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and very necessary, important at the beginning times.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And with those, we would call it an intention and motivation.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And now, then we go to explore the meaning of the Dokjin teachings.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And of course, I'm sure you already know what the Dokjin teachings and all that.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 But again, it's not just knowing is important.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Or knowing that is enough.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Because for us, we need to practice.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 To do practice, we need to remind again and again,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 again because our duality mind is very public, publication.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And it just always kind of like neglected and missed the point always.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Even we know that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 So therefore, again, kind of bring to reminding each other

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 is that our kind of like what we should do.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 That's what the Buddha's teachings are called.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Sangha members means helping and supporting each other

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 along the path to reach enlightenment.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 So as we are all Sangha members, and we remind each other.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So in that state, I will in a way remind you,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 according to my best capabilities of the teaching,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 through the light of the guru and sambhava and the lineage masters.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And how, through what we are going to do,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 and that is then this great teaching.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 I think many of you maybe read the book,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and you already have this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 This is the very famous Dzokhi teaching

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 that taught by the guru and sambhava.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And also even translated a long time ago, John Reynolds.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 I think many of you maybe had that,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 or maybe now even they have new version of translation too,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 because Dharma is quite flourishing everywhere.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So that, I'm sure you read that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 But however, whether you read or not,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 we will go on these meanings this.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Now, we talk a little bit about all this teaching generally,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 and little bit history of the teaching, and that is how.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 And this is again, Dzokhi teaching is the teaching of the Buddha,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni gave this teaching,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 not in the form of what we see Buddha, like this, not this form.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Buddha gave this teaching in the sambhava form.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And where he gave this teaching, in the Sahaja Rams,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 and so many enlightened beings,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Dakas and Dakinis, Buddha Shakyamuni gave this teaching.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And also, often known as Buddha Shakyamuni gave Dzokhi teaching

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 in form of the Buddha Samyantabhadara

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 or the Buddha Vaidya Sato.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 That Buddha Shakyamuni gave this teaching.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Teachings.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 As this teaching, whether we give this teaching,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 and this teaching is a camp in this human world,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 very famous again in my teacher, master,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 known as Garabdorgi.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Garabdorgi brought this Dzokhi teaching

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 or the reward, this teaching.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Teaching, Dzokhi teaching to this world.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And Garabdorgi was also known as the emanation of the Buddha Vaidya Sato.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 It came in the form of the human Vaidya.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Garabdorgi is the form of the Vaidya Sato in human forms.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 So that is what the Garabdorgi is, Garabdorgi.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 And then, Garabdorgi is the form of the disciple.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 The teacher is known as the Manjichiri Mathara.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And the Manjichiri Mathara,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 the Manjichiri Mathara

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 entires Dzokhi teachings into three groups,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 known as then the mind sections,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 spirit sections, and the feet instruction sections.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 That we divide into that three sections.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And then the form of the disciple of the Manjichiri Mathara

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 is known as Shri Sangha.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 And Shri Sangha divided again the feet instruction section,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 the third section of Dzokhi teaching,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 divided into four or more sections,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 out of the most secret sections of that.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 And that all essence teachings,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 then kind of reword by the great master of such board,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 clear by board.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Then by Garabdorgi and Masambhava,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 great master of Brahmana Mathras.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And later on, great master, master teacher.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 That is really how the Dzokhi teaching is.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And then Murabar Masambhava, who came,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 or Brahmana Mathras who came in that century.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And Murabar Masambhava is known as then

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 the direct emanation of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 and as well as the Buddha Shakyamuni himself.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Both came in one target as in Murabar Masambhava.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Murabar Masambhava reword so many Vajrayana teachings and board.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 He is also known as the Vajrayana Great Buddhas.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 He really brought so many reword,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 so many teachings of Maghreel,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 but also Vajrayana teachings to this world

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 and to the connected portion there,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 all that with disciples.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And this is what Murabar Masambhava,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 among that one of his great teachings,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 among all teachings.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And then this is the Dzokhi teaching.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 So that is how the Dzokhi teaching came.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And they continually preserved that Dzokhi teaching

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 in a debate by the practices,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 meditation, meditation, and studying,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 continually created on, until now,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 as unbroken lineage and systems.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And this Dzokhi teaching also came a little bit.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 When Murabar Masambhava gave the Dzokhi teaching,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 this Dzokhi teaching is transmitted

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 in two different channels or two different systems.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Those are known as the Kama and the Thema Ladies.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So two systems, that is also related.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Also these two lineages,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 all of them as one sundial lineage,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 all came to separately, continually and now there.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 And in particular today's teaching,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 what we are going to discuss is Thema teachings,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 all the hidden, rediscovered lineage teachings.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 This is Murabar Masambhava told

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 in the 8th century, century, century,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 and then same time,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 thinking of the future generations,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 then he and the Vasranathini teachings,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 all the hidden in these teachings,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 teachings, and then rediscovered by very famous,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 one very famous young material known as the Kama Nambas.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Kama Nambas discovered these Thema teachings

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 around 16, no sorry, around 12 or 13th century,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 around that time.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Around that time, he discovered this teaching,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 and this become the one, the most powerful,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 powerful Thema teachings.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Throughout all to be practiced in particular

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 of course, a new and a graduate school

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 to where Buddhism has become very popular teachings.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 And in time, that whole cycle of teaching

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 is known as the Peaceful Wrath of deities,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 and also self-liberated practice.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 So from that cycle, this is the teaching, Kambhara.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Kambhara, this is known as then,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 a kundra, a clear betas, let it, does it.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 From the self-liberated realization,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 mind of the performed Peaceful Wrath of deities,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 this teaching is not introduced in a negative awareness,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 negative awareness, moment you see breath liberation

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 or the realizations.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 That is the title of these teachings.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 So that is what it is.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And now, we go to the next phase itself.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 So that's the really kind of overview

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 of how this lineage came and included titles.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And now, we go to this text itself.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And then, now, this is what?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 First is homage.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Homage.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 This is the word "Umbara Pema Sambhava",

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 which is as I said, hidden, read the score,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 buy this great title.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 He transcript this teaching.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 So first is, "Umbara Pema Sambhava" is paying homage.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Pay homage or respect to whom?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 "Umbara Pema Sambhava" respecting, paying homage,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 homage to the three guys, as I said before,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 and I'm sure you know three guys.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 "Dharmakaya", "Sambhokaya", and then the "Makayas".

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 These three guys, these three guys,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 he said, "I pay homage".

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 The deity or the Buddha of the three guys,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 what is these three guys?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Where is this three guys?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 It's sub-luminating one's own evolution.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Sub-luminating one's own evolution.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 So this is not the three guys,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 it's externally existing paying homage.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 It is pointing out, this is, from here it is pointing out.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 We all inherited this beautiful nature,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 it is known as sub-evaleness.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Sub-evaleness is our nature.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 That is inherited in each and every one, all with heaven.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 We all have this.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 This nature is in body meant for three guys.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 This, it is, what, "evaleness" in Tibet,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 what is called, "rapa", "rapa" or "evaleness".

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 It is, nature is what?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 It is not done.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 No "rapa" is not peaceful object.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 It is sub-luminating.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 This is your mind.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 This is my mind.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It is our nature, that's the way we are.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 So this time when we think, give this teaching,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 or we go through this teaching,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 we are not going to think in somewhere else's mind,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 or somewhere else's talking nature.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 It's very up your nature, nature of mind.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Everyone is talking nature.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 So now we are here, very big in what the great mass

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and the great mass are saying to you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Your nature, "rapa" is sub-luminating.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It is clear.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 This sub-luminates what is known as,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 it is intelligence.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 "Rapa" is intelligence.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 "Rapa" is resistance.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 "Rapa" is awareness, or the awareness is awareness,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 is a belief in awareness.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And there is sub-luminating.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 It's not somebody else coming

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and putting the torch on that and illuminating.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It is sub, "rapa" itself is illuminating.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 That how also we can know.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 For example, we know ourselves.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 When we are happy, we don't have to ask someone

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 to the doctor who said, "Am I happy?"

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Do we need really ask to anyone then, "Am I happy?"

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 No, you know you are happy.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Also same time when we say it,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 we don't have to go to ask anyone to say it or suffering.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 You know that intelligence is known as sub-luminating,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 sub-clarity, sub-intelligence.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 It is not somebody else doing that.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 It is our self, your nature,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 nature and my nature.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 This is the one that "rapa" is.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 "Nature" is.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 This if we go deeper that or let it return on this,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 then this is in "krikāya".

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 That means "krikāya" means enlightened status.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 "Rapa" is your nature,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 my nature is all in enlightened status.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 When we talk about the Buddha,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 you are already talking about the Buddha as enlightened.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 It is true Buddha is enlightened.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 I mean, our "rapa",

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 "rapa" is enlightened.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Your "rapa" is enlightened.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 My "rapa" is enlightened.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Enlighted, completely enlightened,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 is not part of enlightened.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 It is total, completely enlightened.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And how?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 In a "krikāya" status.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 "Dharmakaya" status, "Sambhokaya" status,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 "Namakaya" status, we are all enlightened.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Every aspect of it,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 we call it enlightened,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 is right with you, right with us.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 To recognize that nature as it is

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 and with delight and with confidence,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 confident, that is known as beholding your nature of the mind,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 my nature of the mind.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 "Gurupaya Masanga" saying, "pering homages."

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 The other little homie means what?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 The respect, right?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 That I am going to report on.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Respect in the apricot.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 But there is, according to the other little Buddhism,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Buddha still, there is three different ways,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 respect.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Respect as an object and socket with great respect.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Or respect with understanding

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 where everything is like in the mandala of the Buddha,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 as he said before in the music.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 But in that realization being that state

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 is known as then meditation respect.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 So when you don't have doubt and hesitation,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 when you merge in that nature status,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 that is respect.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 That's right.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Respect, that is dream respect.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 That's the second respect.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 And the fourth, third respect is,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 right in nature as it is,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 is without a socket or an object.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 That is the ultimate respect.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 This time, pay homage to the self-illuminated clarity

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 of the three guide of the South Awareness,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 it is the ultimate respect.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 When you didn't see this,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 there is no socket or an object divided.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 There is no, not the door is the other side,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 and what we are knowing is the other side,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 not socket or an object.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Yes, as moment you used to recognize,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 that moment is merged in one single state,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 as free from the socket or an object.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 That realization is known as in the ability

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 to talk yourself,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 recognize that truly nature as it is.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 This is the most highest relaxed practice,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 highest performance,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 highest merging in that state,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 as beyond the socket or an object.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 That means no humanities.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Humanity's domain is gone,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 just merged in nature's state,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 exactly as it is.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 This is the word, pay homage.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Homage, this is,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 this, this, this, this free homage,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 as Guru Pemma Sambar said here,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 this gathering really encompasses entirely these teachings.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 But now these follow the teachings of all these,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 these teachings about this rubber,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 teachings about the three guides,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 that's what it is.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Teachings about our, our nature, your nature,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 my nature, this talk, talk.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 That is, so this is the summary in the way

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 of the entire teachings,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 hundreds of teachings.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Now going there more details on these teachings,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 teachings.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 So now we explore,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 exploring what the nature is,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 one after another step.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 This exploring nature is

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 also generally in the Buddhism,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Buddhism teaching, what Buddhism in the teaching.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 For example,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 with Buddhism in the first teaching in Sarnam,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 or Varanasu, what we called,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Paul Gautam of the teachings,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 what Gautam said first,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Paul Gautam of the teaching is,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 suffering truth,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 must be master understanding suffering truths.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 That's what Gautam said,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 master understanding suffering truth.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Second, the Gautam of the teaching is,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 you must be a bender cause of suffering truths.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Also United States is suffering.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Second,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 a bender,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 give up the cause of suffering truths,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 cause of suffering truths.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 How to give up the cause of suffering truths?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 You must follow the path,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 follow the path,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 follow the path.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 That is path truth,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 follow the path truth,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 all of it.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And third,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 so report,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 actualizing the cessation status.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 What is season?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 All the duality publications are season.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 You must have actualized seasons.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 So what is this form of truth,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 the essence teachings,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 for example,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 in this case,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 in the Philippines,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 master understanding,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 then have the determination to give up the cause,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 turn,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 follow the path,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 then actualize it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 So now, in this case,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 all of this teaching is follow with the path.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Follow with the path.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 What do we like to cease?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 We like to cease.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Dualities.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Duality ceased.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 That is what we like to be actualized.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 This duality is not going to cease.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 We don't follow with the path.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 In this case,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 follow with the path or the path.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Follow the nature of the path as it is.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 That is the what it is.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Follow with the path or the path.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Now, here,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 with this understanding,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 here,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 then put the Masambhavana in our teaching.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 (Applause)

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 So there are no following the path.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Following, we are going to follow the Dzogki path.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Dzogki is the highest teaching of the birds.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 What actually, again,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 to go breathe out is one after another.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 What means Dzogki?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Dzogki is very old,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 which means everything completely.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Nothing is missing.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 In this case,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 what is Dzogki?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Dzogki can be divided into three sectors.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 The foundational Dzogki,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 path Dzogki,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 and the result Dzogki.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 What is this path Dzogki?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 The foundation Dzogki is the nature of our mind,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 the nature of the Rapa.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 That is foundation.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 We are going to use this.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 What is this nature?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Rapa is what?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Rapa is free from object and subject,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 free from the existing, non-existing, needle and eating.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 And Rapa is, in the general ballast terminology,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 is a great emptiness,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 great Mother Pandya Paramata,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 great that nature,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 great nature of that emptiness.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 That is the foundation of Dzogki.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Once you have understood that foundation,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 now you are going to explore that.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Following that,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 that is known as path Dzogki.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Follow the path.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 That means you are practicing.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Once you discover that foundation,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 that nature,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 is not just enough,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 enough we have to bring that full realization.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 To bring full realization is,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 then,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 practicing,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 practicing.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Keep practicing.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 That is known as following path.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And that is, then, in this teaching,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 explaining,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 explaining how to follow that path.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Once you follow that path,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 then what do you actually do?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Realization,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 nature,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Rapa,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 anxiety as it is,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 without any hindrance,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 without any obstacles of,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 you are reduced.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 That is known as the fruit Dzogki.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Fruit Dzogki.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 So that,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 this kind of,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 just keep that thought in the mind.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Mind,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 that's how we follow that.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Now with this understanding,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 when we follow this Dzogki,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 follow the path,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 then here,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 great Master,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 great Master,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 once again say this,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 from the profound nature of the,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 the peaceful Rapa teaching.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 That's self-liberating.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 And then,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 I will show you that,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 or I will point out,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 self-liberating nature,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 of the naked nature of the Rapa.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 That is what Pirma says.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And now,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 He said,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 in order to start pointing out the Rapa,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Rapa,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Rapa,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 here,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I'm going to be a Master Master.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 He said,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 in order to point out the Rapa,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Rapa,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 listen,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 or carefully,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 or attentively,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 pay,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 attentively,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 or pay,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 pay attention,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 pay attention,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 for in that,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 practitioner's,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 for in the practitioner,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 pay attention carefully,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 and,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 and,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 for in the practitioner's.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Or for in that,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 noble son,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and noble daughter's.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 So that's what he said.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 He said, teaching, you absorb that teaching.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 That means also,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 teaching must be absorbed to the heart.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Not come from the right ear,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 and lift other ears,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 ears, kind of like exit,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 but let that teaching absorb to the heart.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 It is about our nature of the mind.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Your nature of the mind,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 we're not talking any strange things anywhere else.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 We're talking about our self,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 our treasure,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 our nature,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 as I said before.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 So therefore,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 just pay attention now.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 We're discovering one after another

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 our this beautiful nature,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 the scholar or the mystery of these beautiful natures.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 And now,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 with that,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 and then there is also some teachings.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 The word said,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Samaya Jadya.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 That is,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 it's very precious,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 very sugared,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 and honor,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 and respect,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and keep as your treasure,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 keep as your heart and structure.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And now,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 with that,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 and then Gautama Sama begins here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 He said,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Eh Maho.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Eh Maho is a Sanskrit word,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 means amazing,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 awesome,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 oh how wonderful, wonderful.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 That means,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 so that begins,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 awesome,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 wonderful,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 amazing,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 wondrous,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 how beautiful it is.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 That is beautiful.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 The Treacle is with you.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Treacle is with me.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 This is one of the brilliant day of today,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 we're discovering our Treacles.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 We're not missing anything.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 The whole Treacles are with us.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Whole Treacles of the Enlightenment beings,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 all Treacle of the samsara,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 everything is with us.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 All that started from here,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 from your Rupa,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 from your Maho Rupa,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 all awareness,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 all my awareness.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Therefore, it's wonderful.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 It's how rich,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 how powerful,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 how pervasive,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 how glorious,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 how deep,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 and how infinite it is.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 For that reason,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 it's so amazing,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 so marvelous,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 so wonderful.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 That's what is it.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Now,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 in the teachings,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 so what that said,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 and then Gautama Sama says,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 now of this mind,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 mind is the pervasive college,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 pervasive,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 both samsara and Naranas.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Naranas.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Narana and samsaras,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 what we,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 I think many of you know,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 this is the Buddhist,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 in the Buddhist teachings,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 the big terminology.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Samsara means,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 all this universe of all.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 This is called samsaras.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 And Narana is all the Enlightenment things.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Every time,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 what we're looking forward,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 all the Buddhist practices,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 looking forward to reach,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 to become,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 to capture the Naranas,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 or the Enlightenment,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 or the Buddha,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Buddha's dominion,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Buddha's environment,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 enlightened environment,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 which is so powerful.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Samsara is where we are,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 and Narana is what we're looking forward

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 for by the practitioners.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 These two are so big,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 so gigantic,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 so pervasive in a way.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 But where that started,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 who's ruling that?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 That these two,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 is no other than one's own mind.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 So that means,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Narana is coming from your mind,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 samsara is coming from our mind,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 or our mind or your mind.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 It's nothing else.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 Therefore,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 mind is the most powerful.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Our mind,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 everyone's mind is so powerful,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 according to Buddhism,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 it is the de-mostly producer

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 of every environment,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 of everything,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 both in samsara and Naranas.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 His mind,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 if I use the word now,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 the awareness.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Rupa,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Rupa is the producer

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 of both samsara and Naranas.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 What is the difference in Buddhism,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 or in the Dzokhi teaching?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Sometimes, generally,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 there is mind in India too,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 I think there is a miniature,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 synonyms about the mind.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Mind,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 thought,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 intelligence.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 I mean,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 you have many names of the mind.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 In the Tibetan Buddhism,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 there is so many names in the mind,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 about the synonym of the mind.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 But particularly in the Dzokhi teaching,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 use the mind and the Rupa.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Mind is,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 I am translating,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 mind.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Mind and the Rupa,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 what is in the Dzokhi teaching?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Same in the Rupa.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Same in the Rupa.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 If we translate the same into English,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 it is mind.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Rupa,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 if we translate it into English,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 it is awareness.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 What in the Dzokhi teaching

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 makes that big distinction.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 What is the distinction of the mind,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 or same in the Rupa?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Or mind and awareness?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 And mind is duality.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Dualities.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Rupa is pretty from the dualities.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 So now you think,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 what is the difference?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Both have the intelligence.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Both have clarity.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Both have,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 what do you call it?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 I am a Muslim.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Both have.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 But one is

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 duality, one is out of duality,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 or pretty from duality.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Duality.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And what is the,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 both are,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 where is both?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Both are the same nature.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 There is no different compartment of the mind

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 or the Rupa,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 or same in the Rupa,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 or mind and awareness.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Both are the same.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 With duality is called mind.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Without duality is known as awareness or the Rupa.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 I am translating awareness,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Rupa as awareness.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And samsara is produced

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 by the dualities.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 And nirvana is produced

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 by the beyond duality,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 or Rupa.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Mind that which is beyond or pretty from dualities.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 So that is the difference.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 What is the difference between?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Otherwise, both are the same.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 That.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 That.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 So now,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 this is the nature of the mind.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Mind is pervasive

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 to both samsara and nirvana.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Nirvana,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 this is what it is.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 But when you don't recognize this nature,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 because we are duality,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 we are conjugated by force of dualities.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Dualities,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 dualities,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 then we.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Duality always looking subject and objects.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Subject and objects,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 and always thinking something is outside.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Outside and carried by that.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And as we are kind of deluded by that looking solution from the outside,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 then it is just continually deluded.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Deluded one after another.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And just ripple effect,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 or it is chain reactions.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 It is just continually carried by force of duality

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 and wandering in the world of dualities.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Reality level,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 that duality itself.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 That duality itself is not really existing as a subject or object.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 If you investigate, analyze,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 where is this duality?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 What is that?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 The moment you put that inquiry

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 to the system of duality,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 the best of duality,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 identity of duality,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 nature of duality is collapsed.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Collapsed.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And that is what in the Dzokhi teaching,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 known as liberated.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Where?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Liberated.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Its own natural status.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Natural status.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 Natural still has a great emptiness.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Great openness.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 It is like naturally dissolved or naturally liberated.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And when we duality is fabricated as a subject or object,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 then we didn't recognize this nature of the mind.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 That clarity and continually arising awareness,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 we didn't recognize.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Recognize.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 And because we carry the force,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 we are looking to the one direction all the time.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Duality is gone at the mind,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 narrow mind and looking to the other directions.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 And this is how we can see that.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And however,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 the nature of your mind or our rukpa,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 our mind is nothing really obscured,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 even by the dualities.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Even dualities during all this publication

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 is only happening on the surface.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 On the surface,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 reality nature of the rukpa is nothing blocked at all.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 It's totally open freedom in an unstoppable status.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 It's therefore called unseasoned status.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Nature is unseasoned.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 It's continually throwing these rukpas.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 This is, in order to recognize this nature,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 exactly to find out the teachings,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 to the nature of the mind,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 all those teachings are given by the Buddha.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 All the teachings,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 those teachings are known as the 84,000 standard teachings.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Buddha gives all those teachings

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 only to recognize the secret system of the nature,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 of our awareness or the nature of the mind or the rukpa.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Otherwise, there is nothing Buddha gives any teachings

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 except to recognize this nature of the mind,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 all these teachings.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Everything, whatever the Buddha gives the teachings,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 it's all purpose to discover this innate nature,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 the system as it is.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Those old teachings the Buddha gives,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 why Buddha gives so many of those teachings?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Buddha doesn't want to give, make the forceful to,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 accord their readiness, accord their capability.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Readiness, Buddha gives all those teachings.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Those teachings, are they explaining these teachings?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Or maybe I won't go, but,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 but however, those teachings are known as the,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 all those according to my system is called nayana teachings.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 All the teachings, all the Buddhist generally say,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 all the Theravada teachings,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 mayana teachings and as well as vedayana teachings,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 all those teachings Buddha gives.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Every teaching is aligned toward to discover this nature.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 They teach one after another gradually to discover

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 our inner nature, nature of the mind.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Every teachings, all teaching really follows to that direction.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 There's nothing else, else, all these teachings.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 So, that's what the Murabaya Masambhasa did this.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 This, all the teachings that so vast, so deep,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 so profound, 84,000 teachings or more plus teachings,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 whatever the Buddha give the teachings of the,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 like Buddha Shakyamuni who is called Buddhism

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 is considered as the Buddha of the person term,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 or person, these eras.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Whatever will give that teaching is purpose to discover these teachings.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Pasture Buddhas of the according Buddhism, Buddhism,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 there is like according one thousand Buddha of the fortunate eons,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 I think many of you already know those,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 and then three Buddha came before.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 What they give Buddha, those teachings,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 only purpose to discover this nature.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 And the future upcoming among the one thousand Buddha,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 there is 996, I think, Buddha is going to come.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Those teachings are all teaching of the, to discover this nature.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Nature, otherwise there's nothing else.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 So, whatever, and then in this Buddha's teaching,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 or Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching, divided according to human,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 nine yana teachings, such as like Shravagayana teaching,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 but the Buddha teaching, Bodhisattva yana teaching,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 those are known as the causal yanas,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 all the sutrayana, sutra teachings,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 and tantarana teaching can be divided into two groups,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 outer tantra, inner tantra,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and outer tantra can be divided into three more,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 which is known as kriya tantra, oba tantra, yoga tantra,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 and inner tantra can be divided into maha yoga,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 anu yoga, ati yoga, all those teachings.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 Teaching is the only to propose, to discover our inner nature of the mind,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 nature of the thing.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 What is, what the reason to, why have to discover this inner nature?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 I think we said so many times, you know,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 because then we discovered our inner nature,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 the samsara delusion will be ended,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 samsara delusion will be free,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 and then what we call, we become the enlightenment,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 we become the Buddha.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 It's nothing changed anything then,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 but our environment is become as environment of the pre-formidualities,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 enlightenment qualities.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Then we don't have the struggling of the samsara,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 all the turbulence what we go through in the samsara.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 That nightmare, that phenomena is removed

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 or liberated within our own inner nature state.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 That's applied somewhere else, but it's just sub-liberated,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 within it in nature state.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Our environment is completely become as enlightened state.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 All the delusion and the fabrications

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 and the difficulties, challenges are completely ended.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 That is known as the end of the samsara,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 end of the delusion, or the end of all heart-shaven difficulties.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 So that is what it is.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Therefore, that is what this teaching says.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 All these teachings, whatever the Buddha gives,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 is teaching to recognize and to discover our distributed inner natures.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 So that is one breathing, kind of like one's sessions.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 But again, moreover there is going to be samsara teaching,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 this, then here.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 It says again, "Oh, how amazing!"

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 The 14th day, "Naba son" and "Naba daughter"

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 listen to me, listen to me.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 And to discover this nature of the mind,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 or to discover this nature of the mind,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 there is so many varieties of the philosophical systems that came.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Variety of the philosophical systems and schools

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 and religious spiritual groups coming one after another

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 to discover this inner nature.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 There is many of those.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 So many schools, so many different things.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 And so that, and to really summarize that,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 and all this, what is this mind is known as,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 and only what is this mind called?

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 What is the only mind?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 They didn't recognize the nature of the mind,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 and therefore they are wandering in the three realms or the six realms.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 They are wandering.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 We are all wandering in the three realms, six realms,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 because not knowing the nature of our mind or nature.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Somebody tell nature, we don't recognize that,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 and we are wandering in the three realms or the six realms.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 Three realms, I think if we use those terminologies,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 the three realms is known as desire realms,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 palm realms, and palmless realms.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 Six realms, three lower realms, and three upper realms.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 So altogether, six realms.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 And those are just listed as names, and you can look to the others.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 That's two of those people who don't know those things.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And this is according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 there is six realms, six realms.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 So that means, in a way, almost six different categories of beings

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 who are experiencing six different kinds of environments,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 because due to their own karma or their own dualities.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 And those six realms, such as hell realms,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 hunger ghost realms, animal realms.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 And then the fourth is our human realms,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 and the fifth is known as the asara realm or demi-gods realms,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 and the sixth is the realm of the gods or the divine.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 That's those all known as six realms.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 No matter whatever their environment,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 whatever their experience they are going to throw,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 but still they are all dualities.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Therefore, there is samsara, all of that in samsara.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 They can be changed.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 Change is samsara, samsara.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Samsara, we are wondering. Why is it called wondering?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Why is it used more and more wondering that, or wandering, or roaming?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Roaming, because, and that in a way living beings,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 according to Buddhism, I mean, you all know,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 that it's not the first time we came here,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 nor it will be not last.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 As long as we have the fuel of the karma and the dualities,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 our moving, the environment of the system is never going to end.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 As long as you have the cause and condition to be dreaming,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 dream not going to end.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 As long as you are sleeping and cause and condition are there,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 we begin to dream all the time.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Dream not going to end.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Similarly, samsara experience is never going to end.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 And as long as fuel of the ever used terminology symbol, the dualities.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 As long as we have duality, that long we will be wandering in samsara.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 And that's wandering in samsara according to our degrees,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 our creation and fuel of the dualities.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 If duality created something big, heavy cause as fuel,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 that will take us to the lower realms.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 As light fuel of duality, it will take to the upper realms.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 That's what according to Buddhism, Buddha taught that.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 So samsara that we be wandering.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 How long we are going to wander?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Until we realize our nature of the mind or the rupa.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 Until we realize that long we are going to wander.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Wander that.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 And once we recognize the rupa,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 or once we discover our innate nature of the mind,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 then we are not going to wander.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 We are not going to roaming.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Roaming.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 And we are going to become as enlightened beings or the great Bodhisattva.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Bodhisattva is an enlightened being.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 The Buddhas, they are not roaming because they see the future destinations.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 They see everything within their awareness.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 Everything is in their radar, radar sports.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 For example, ourself, we don't know, many of us,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 we really don't know what is going to be next year or even next week.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 We are always on the presumption status.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 And we don't know anything of the past.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 That then what have their memories of our young times.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Before that, we don't know.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 In the future, we don't know. There is only small window of light in the present time we see.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 That is also very small, very tiny.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 We really don't see.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 That's how the duality is blocking us.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 Every, our environment, even our intelligence, our understanding is blocking.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 So our is presumptions.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 And whatever the duality takes, we are in the kind of mercy or the hand of dualities.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 But the Buddhas are enlightened beings.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 They are enlightened.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 They see past, they see present, they see future.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Everything is in their control and the destination.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Therefore known as emanations, emanating.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 Our birth is rebirth. It's not emanation. Nations.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Even we are taking the similar same way.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 The emanation taking the birth, we are taking the birth,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 but it's kind of different styles, different systems.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 Even looks like same, but it's different.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 One is fully understanding.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 One is unknowing show by the chance of the duality or the karma.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 So we are wondering.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 In a way we are wondering without knowing the destination

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 as like blindfold of the dualities.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 That's why Maripam or Samba are used.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 Then wondering in some six realms.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 Why is the wandering there?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Here he said, I said already said that,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 because not knowing the nature of the mind.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 We are wondering, wondering.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 And then according Buddhism,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 Buddhism, Sharvaka Jhana and the Pate Buddha Jhana

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 realized the nature of the mind on one part, not fully again.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 They didn't realize completely that.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 That and then so forth.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 So then according to the looking of the Zukhi teaching,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 it's the highest teaching of the Buddha Shaktamunyas.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 Is it a great master of Lunkiva use the example

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 as like peak of the mountain, panakkal of the top of the mountain,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 mountain of mountain Sumerus.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 When you look to the panakkal of the top of the mountain,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 when you read the highest of the mountain, peak of the mountain,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 when you look all under that,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 you see how high which mountain is high.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 You can see, see clearly which is high, what is this.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 Similarly, when you look in the point,

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 in the standing kind of view of the Zukhi teaching,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 looking to all the other teachings of the Jhanas,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 then see the explorations or exploring of the nature of the mind.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 How much they explode? What is this?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 So if you're looking from the top of the mountain

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 or the panakkal of the Zukhi view,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 then when you look to all the other earth Jhanas,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 including Mahayoga, Anayoga, what is,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 what they discovered natures.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 So in that point view, then there is also always

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 there is some kind of like, some incomplete, incomplete, incomplete.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Therefore, Zukhi is a complete teachings,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 complete all the Zukhi teachings.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 So here, Gurbayama Sambo said everything.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 For example, all these different schools,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 including Mademaga, Kriayoga, Tantra,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 and as well as Mahayoga and Anayoga.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 There is still some undiscovered natures

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 and a code to compare with the Zukhi teachings.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 Where the Zukhi teaching is fully discovered.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 What is fully discovered?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Because Zukhi teaching is not connected

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 or is going beyond, sorry, I should say,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 it's beyond of the mind.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Every other school's teachings

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 are still based on the conceptual or the same,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 same and conceptual basis.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 But Zukhi is beyond of the mind.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Or it is Yishi or the, what's the, pristine,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 pristine awareness states.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 So therefore, therefore, each of when you look to the,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 even the Mahayoga, Anayoga teaching,

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 it still has some degrees of the, of the,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 of the conception aspect, kind of focus on this.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Such as the Mahayoga teaching,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 focus on the more kind of purity divine status,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 which is so special, pure, pure.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 But again, to compare with the Zukhi,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 that that purity conception is duality.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Duality still is duality.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 Anayoga teaching is a more design,

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 again, more, more purity, more blissfulness.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 More blissfulness, more spaciousness nature.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 And to compare with, again, to the Zukhi,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 that is the conceptions, still the conceptions.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 So breakthrough, all the conceptions

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 immediately to the, leading to the self-awareness

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 beyond the duality is the Zukhi teaching.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 So therefore, this Zukhi teaching is the highest teachings.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 And every others are really leading.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Leading still can relate some tendency of the different duality.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 But this is not the errors of these teachings.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Teachings, generally what the Buddha gives the teaching,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 accord and readiness,

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 accord and capability of the practitioners,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Buddha is leading that.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 So Zukhi is the highest and therefore,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 this teaching is what is completed.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 Everything is completed.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Whole entire teachings.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Now, so that is the kind of generally explanation

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 of the how the Zukhi teaching

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 and how the Zukhi teaching is so special

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 and highest in teachings.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 And the next group, I mean now,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 so there, the next teaching is now

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 talking about more nature of the mind.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 Now the teachings on nature, more nature of the mind.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 Now, we look to our mind.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 You look to our mind.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 What is mind?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 When you look to the mind,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 mind is intelligence,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 mind is a river right here.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Here.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 That is what the mind.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 You look, I mean, when I talk this,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 you look to your mind.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 You must correct it what Gurbel somebody say

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 with your own mind right now.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 Right now.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 So, here, Gurbel somebody said,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 mind is vuvat, mind is intelligence.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 You read.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 It is true or not.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 When you read this, now,

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 what that intelligence vuvat mind is,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 is where is this?

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Where is this?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 Again, you look to that.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 Read that with your mind.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Where is your mind?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 What point we find the answers with this?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 This.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 We will ask this each question.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 So, not just we ask.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 Gurbel somebody was asking that.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Introducing, pointing out,

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 directly to our energy and nature of the mind.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 We are exploring our nature.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 The hidden nature.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 Nature.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Therefore, and firstly, what Gurbel somebody said,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 is vuvadily aware and intelligence.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 That which is oscillating roughly, this meaning.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 So, is this true or not?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 And what the answers we have.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 And then the next one is,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 where is that now intelligence vuvat talks?

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Where is this?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 What answer we have?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Next one, Gurbel somebody said,

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 from this mind, all this pain and happiness arising.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 From this mind.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Our pain and our happiness.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 It's also arising from this.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 Now we think of this generally.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 What that means then that?

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 Generally in the Dzogic teaching,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 teaching in Buddhism,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 what's called, there is like,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 for example, as we went through,

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 through kind of different names, at least in the names.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 There is Buddhism.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 Sharakayana, Parthigbuddhayanas.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 And bodhisattvayanas.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 There is postriyanas.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Yanas.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 And bodhisattvayana is another synonym is Mahayanas.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Mahayana can be divided into two groups.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 Those are known as mind only schools

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 and Mademaka schools or the middle way schools.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 These two schools.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Promised only schools, what that means mind only school?

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Named.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 It's because named in this school says everything is mind.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 That means subject is mind, object is mind.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 Our environment everything is mind.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 Everything is mind.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 Mind.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 There is nothing.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 It's all mind.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 Then maybe we argue how we can see this is mind,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 this all object is mind.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 It's not really mind we can see.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 See that.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 But in this school says this is,

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 we developed this from long-term egos.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 There are three habit patterns.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 Habit patterns of the universe,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 habit patterns of the physical,

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 habit patterns of the environment or the usage.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 The three habit patterns we developed long-term egos.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 That is three habit patterns.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 This is what they use examples in the dream.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 When we are dreaming,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 when we are sleeping in a warm bed and vice pillows

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 and we have the dreams,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 when we have the dreams,

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 what we have dreams?

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 We have subject, we have object.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 We have usage of that.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 Object program in the universe,

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 building house and all these things we have.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 And subject we have we are,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 we are ourself, we are engaging that.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 Usage we have good and bad and feeling and all those things.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
 All those things we have.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 These three things are where it comes from.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 These three things vividly we have in the dream.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
 All that.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 Where that comes from?

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
 It's nothing but from our mind.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 Everything comes from our mind.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 Hold that systems.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 Whatever our experience,

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 all whatever we are going through is our mind.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 This is how similarly we develop that thought long time ago.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Long time means what?

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
 According to Buddhism,

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 big and less times,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
 big and less times,

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
 we've been wandering in the samsaras.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 During that time we develop that habit patterns.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 In this school says,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 each time we're making stronger habiture because our duality,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 grass and cling,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 make stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 and then we develop the whole these environments.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 Reality level is nothing,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
 is all emanated projected by the mind.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
 Everything.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 That's what the mind only schools.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 This is the rough,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 this is one of the profound philosophy schools of the Buddhism.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 This is very deep and profound.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 That, but this is just kind of a highlight of the kind of symbol that you're telling this.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
 From this mind only school,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
 all the way to the Dzogchi teaching,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 saying there's no difference as everything is the mind.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 Therefore, I'm going to remember somebody saying here,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 this mind is vivid,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
 mind is like intelligence,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 and where is this mind?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
 And this developed, all this happiness and peace,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
 all come from this.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
 From this.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 This is again what is there for.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 When you bring this realization,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
 bring this clearly understand of the way the nature is,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
 everything is our mind.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
 Actually, really our mind.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 For example, like when we're talking about the Sathya Sathya,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
 Sathya Sathya said five aggregates, five aggregates,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
 that is, I think many of you know this,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
 form aggregates, feeling, perception,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 conception, and conscience.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
 Those are known as five aggregates.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 These five aggregates, according to Buddhism,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000
 every combined things can be included within the five aggregates.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 There's nothing is left out.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
 Whether it's malakku, whether it's bottom,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 the new term, right?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 Bottom, new term.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 I'm sorry.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
 That you know, I think, what I'm talking then.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 That's it, I think.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 All atoms, atoms, ballad, atoms,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 all the quantum physics, whatever you're talking,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
 the matter, the mass, something, it all, nothing is not within

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 this five aggregates, according to Buddhism.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
 Everything is this.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
 Everything of these five aggregates looks like big five departments,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 five things, big things.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 But if we can't single out,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 among the five, for our conceptual level,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 five aggregates, among our conceptual level,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 among the five aggregates, four aggregates are our mind,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
 four aggregates are our mind.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 Four, we live out, for time being,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 and then feeling, perception,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 consumption, consciousness is all mind.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
 There's nothing else.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 That is mind.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 So now, when you're thinking of this,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 like feeling, the happiness and pains are mind.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 What is that?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
 It's feelings.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 Feeling, that feeling aggregate,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 this feeling is, is mind.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
 Who is experiencing that?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 It is happiness.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
 Who is identifying it is suffering?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
 No other than the mind.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
 And this is, we're talking, the celestial level,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
 we're not talking any mysteries.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 Mysteries are anything this. It's just the way things are.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 It's really mind.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 Mind. Who's mind?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
 Your mind, my mind.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
 When I say I'm happy, it's my mind.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 When I say I'm sad, it's my mind.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
 I don't.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
 And that happiness, happiness said is not necessarily permanent.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 That can be changed.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 Somebody's happiness, somebody's pain.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 Somebody's pain, somebody's, it can be happiness.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
 There's no substantial solid existing happiness and peace

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 or happiness and sufferings.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
 That's why it is all mind.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
 It's all the, what's called illusion,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
 display of the illusions.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 That's how the samsara of the world it is.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
 There's nothing is, conquer the solid that is.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
 It's all idea, all mind, all that.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 And then when you look to the mind, where is the mind?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 What the Gaurabai Masama pointed out here?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 Or the Jockey teaching.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 Teaching in the Mahamudra teaching, Mademat teaching,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 all those teachings pointed out.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 The Pandya Paramata teaching is mind.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 And where is mind?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
 And mind is nowhere.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 Therefore in the Buddhist Mahayana teaching or those Mademat teaching,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 mind is beyond of the existing, non-existing,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 either and neither.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 Neither all those application looks like,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 kind of like a puddling world.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
 It's true.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
 It's trying to discover it to kind of pulling up the angles of the dualities.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
 Pulling up the kind of knocking out the duality and anchorage.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
 Anchorage.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 And bring the openness state of the nature where the things are.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
 That is what the teachings all about this.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 This.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
 And then, this is,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 also this mind is named so many, so many, so many schools,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 so many publics named on this mind about this.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 They have so many names.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 Names.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
 Some say it's souls.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 Some say it's atmos.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
 And some say it's mind.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 Mind.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 Some say it's the Pandya Paramata.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
 Some say it's Dattankadangarvas.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 Some say it's Mahamudras.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 Some say it's one spear of the, one spear,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
 one spear.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 One say it's, some say it's Darmadattu.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 Some say it is all, all,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 so-called in the storehouse, all,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
 best of alls.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 And some say it's ordinary minds.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
 Have so many names.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 Treat this realistically point where I'm naming this.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
 It's no other than the mind.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
 Mind.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 And everyone talking about this.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 Because no one is talking about all those names with this body.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
 Body is going to live.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
 Body is according to Buddhism.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 It's borrowed from the elements.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
 Fire, water, wind, and earth.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
 This is borrowed, in a way.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 It's illusion.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 We're going to live.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 It's just a question of how long it will last.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 How many years?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 It's just borrowed.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 But everyone is, all those schools,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 someone said, someone took,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
 something deeper than the body.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 They're going to live after body is gone.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
 They're naming where is.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 No other, there's nothing else than the mind.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 All those different names came.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 And they made all the different explanations,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 different public, different kind of put things on this input,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 so many inputs to this mind.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 Nothing else.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 No matter whatever it is.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
 It's all it is.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
 Going around, backside, frontside, all this.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 Naming this, this.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
 And some know it a little bit, some know it not.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 And that's what in the Dzogki teaching kind of use examples.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 Examples, Dzogki and the elephant,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
 fanned, fanned, analyzed by the,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
 analyzed by the born with blind.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 Born with blind.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
 And so they heard so many times elephant.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 Now elephant came.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
 And they're blind, born from the blind.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
 Born with blind, blind.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 They're looking to the, touch to the, to the legs.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 Elephant leg.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 Or they thought the elephant is really big.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
 It's look like tree.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 It's that loud.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 Like this.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
 And they've looked some, some, some touch to the elephant.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 Tails.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 And it's moving, moving.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 Or elephant is moving things.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 And some looking to the elephant trunks.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
 Trunks is a kind of flexible moving.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
 Or it's a flexible looks like big snakes.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 Snakes.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
 And some look like the tusk.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 Tusk, touch to the tusk.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
 Hold.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 And they said, oh, elephant looks like hard as bone.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 Like tusk.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 And all named so many things about that one elephant.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 Fanned.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
 Because they're blind.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 They didn't born with blind.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
 They did.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 Similarly, when you don't know the exactly clearly,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 people name so many things.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 They didn't know little bit, but they didn't understand completely fully.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
 And all different names and indications and inputs came one after another.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 So, this is.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
 But now, this is the mind.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
 This is that, whatever that is mind, whatever the name it is.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 This.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 Now, I'm going to, somebody's pointing out.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 Out.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 Out.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
 Out to this.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 Now, you look to this mind.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 It's already said many times, but this is continuing,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
 explaining our inner nature of the mind.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
 Mind, one after another.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
 And when you look to this mind,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 into the three time frames,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 past, present, and future.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
 This mind.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 And now, you think, where is my past mind?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 And this is not just past mind.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
 We told me about the last week, or yesterday, or a few hours ago.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 Right this moment.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 Your mind.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
 One second before.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
 Before, or one moment before, that mind.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 Where is?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Have you read or asked that question?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
 What is our answer?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
 Answer.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 The answer, there's no answer.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
 It's free from the trace.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 Trace, it is clay emptiness.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
 That is what you see.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 And when you think that this,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
 the present moment.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
 What is this present moment?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
 Moment, moment.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
 Present moment of thought.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 Where is this present moment of thought?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 My thought.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
 Have you asked that question?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
 What we have the answer?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
 Answer.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 There's again, same, nothing.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 And present means, not future thought arrived.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Thought.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 So, what is this now?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 When you look to this mind,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 when you look to this three front,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
 past, past moment, present moment,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 and future moment, kind of free from that three frames,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
 you look to the mind.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 Mind, the answer is here in Guru Purnima Sahib,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 it's nothing to see.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
 Nothing to see, but except brilliant.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
 Kind of openness.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 Openness.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 That is what you have to answer.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 This is what according to Dokriti teaching,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 or in Buddhism, is known as direct perception.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 Direct, valid perception, or valid cognitions.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
 It's not diluted by entities.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
 Not by the imaginations.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
 Not presumptions, not conceptions, in a way.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
 It's direct, valid cognitions.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 Because it's direct, why?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
 It's like this moment.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
 Like this moment.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 You're looking direct to your own nature,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
 to the awareness.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
 When you look to that nature, it's known as fresh.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 This nature is what Guru Purnima Sahib named here,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
 naked, fresh.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 It's naked.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
 What is naked?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
 It's a drama of the past is free,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 future is free, and present, all the dramas are free.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 It's naked, fresh, everness, as it could be, should be.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
 It's as simple, natural, as it is,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 free from all our drama of thoughts.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
 Now you look to this, this nature.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 Nature.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 Nature, if you look to this, is open, unimpeded status.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 That's nothing is existing.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 Nothing is existing.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
 That we can hold.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 Again, of course, you're all looking to your mind this time,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
 the nature of the mind.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 As I said so many times,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 you know we're not talking about somebody else's mind

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 or somewhere else's talking.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
 We're really talking.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 Guru Purnima, somebody is pointing out,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
 "Write our nature of your mind, my mind."

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
 That's how we're going to discover the nature of that

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 so that we can maintain, meditate.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
 When we meditate, what is called meditation is practice.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 Practicing is practice.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
 Practicing, in this case, meditating is practicing.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 Or practicing is meditation.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
 When we do the meditation,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 meditation should be with confidence.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Confidence.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 Meditation should not be lingering with perceptions.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 When you have the confidence,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
 that's what you're going to discover.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
 So now you're really discovering your innate nature

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 exactly as it is.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
 Free from drama, free from perceptions,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
 free from the talking, talking by someone.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 You're looking directly to your own nature.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
 The nature of the mind or the awareness.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
 As you discover whatever,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 you're going to maintain that.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 That maintaining is meditation.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 Maintaining is practice.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 That is what we're going to change in our environment.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 Our whole perceptions, conceptions,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 things, really we're going to change.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
 From this, we're looking to the heart

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
 of the heart and source of everything.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
 Every environment as Sid, I mean I said in teaching Sid,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 is all developed from mind.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
 This is, we're looking now to that producer,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
 that developer.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 We're going to change its own nature,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 not drama ruled by the dualities.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 We're not going to wondering the outskirts of this nature.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
 We're looking to the heart of the nature of the awareness.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 Awareness from that, we're going to rule our environment,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
 our old systems.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 So therefore, this therefore,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
 when we develop the "Wu" or the "Zoki" teaching,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
 we need confidence.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 Every "Wu" we generally say,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
 I'm sure you heard this,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 meditation and conduct.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 You heard those teachings, I'm sure.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
 "Wu" is so important.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
 Important, that is what you're going to maintain.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 That is what, that is the whole thing.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 "Wu" will be meditational with "Wu".

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 Conduct with "Wu".

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 Then result will get.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
 Therefore, this is what we're really teaching.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 This is something so important.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 Always those great masters, one after the other said,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 said that confidence is so important.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
 This time we're not developing confidence.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 Somebody said, oh, I trust you, I have confidence.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 That is, of course, confidence too.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
 But this time, you're looking to the right to your,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 our nature of the mind,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
 with our own intelligence,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 with valid, valid cognitions.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
 And when you discover that nature,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
 nobody can just put to you.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
 It's nature, your nature, that's it.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
 That's what you're going to stand firmly,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 tall and strong, and maintain that.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
 Maintain that.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
 So therefore, this is the word,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 but this is, so it is.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
 When you look to this natural,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 it is open, naked, fresh.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 When you behold this, there's nothing substantial,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
 solid, existing, that we can hold.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 It's totally empty.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
 But that empty is not negation empty.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 Negation is not blank empty.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
 It is clarity.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
 It's brilliant.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 Therefore, it's known as, in the teaching,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 clear emptiness, or clarity emptiness,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
 emptiness with clarity.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
 Inseparable clarity.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
 This clarity is what?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 It's intelligence.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
 Even though there's nothing substantial

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 to hold and grasp, there is,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 but it is real intelligence.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
 This is our nature of the mind.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 So therefore, it's not empty, empty as a blank.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
 It's not, it's kind of clarity or something like,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 as a torch or light or a bulb like that,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
 but it's just open, a clear, clear voice.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
 That is what the nature of the mind is.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 This, this.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 So this nature is not also permanent.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 It's not permanent because there's nothing existing.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 When we say it's permanent, that means something existing,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
 but there's nothing existing.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 Therefore, it is not nothing we can name as permanent.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 Permanent.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
 And also, this nature, as we can now say,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 is like blank or the empty, or blank,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 or if we use the word, null state,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
 or complete kind of blank, absent status.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
 It's not.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 It's building intelligence.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
 How mystery, how wonderful it is.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 That's how this, our, our nature of the mind is.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
 It's open, brilliant, vivid intelligence.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 How it is.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 And it is also that we cannot put its numbers.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 It's not just one, we can say.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 Or this is one.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 One.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 How we can say one, there's nothing existing that we can hold.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
 It's one.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 There's nothing.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 Nothing.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 It is also arising in the same time.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
 All this, as already Gurbi and Masambha said,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
 all the samsaras and naranas are arising from this.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 And with, what is that?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
 There's nothing.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
 How marvelous, how special it is.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
 Therefore, in the Buddha's teaching, always inexpressible.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
 Inconceivable.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 It's something that you cannot put by the imagination

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
 or the conception frames to this nature.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 This is what our nature is, your nature and my nature is.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 How it is.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 Is.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
 And also if we say all the samsara and narana,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
 everything arises from this and all this.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 But from where?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
 It arises.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
 Can you pick one location of each of those?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 No.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
 Again, it's totally free that.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 So all the dhammas, all the frames of what we over with,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
 we named, cannot really apply any of this.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
 This.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 This is what the nature, marvelous nature of the mind is.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 Is.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
 And this is not coming from outside or anywhere.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000
 It is your and our nature of the mind.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000
 Nature of the mind.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 This.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 So this is what the nature of the mind is.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
 Is.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 Okay, I will stop here and we have some questions I'd like to discuss.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
 Yeah, please.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
 Yeah.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
 Thank you.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 Thank you.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
 Thank you.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
 Thank you.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 Dennis.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 Dennis, give me the water.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
 Thank you.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 Okay.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
 Thank you.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
 Just a plain water.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
 No, it is just hot water.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 I thought about it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
 Thank you.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 Okay.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
 Thank you so much.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 Yes, please.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 Okay.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
 So.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 My understanding.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
 We're this bad.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 So let me apologize.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 Pardon.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
 I'm going to probably order this.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
 So I apologize.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 Yeah.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
 Okay.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 So it is my understanding.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
 Yeah.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
 I'm sorry.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 So.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 You find.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 There is no difference between ultimate and conventional reality.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
 What?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
 What?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
 What?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 What?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
 What?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 What?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 It all happens here.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 And if that is so, then isn't clairvoyance only in appearance?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 In other words, it, it seems to be, it appears to be, but it is.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:20.000
 I'm going to go with a perception rather than a direct cognition, because it

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:28.000
 gets viewed as something more in the ultimate nature than actually just kind

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 of what occurs.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
 In other words, what appears to us as clairvoyance is just naturally occurring.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
 It's just a play of things as they happen.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 There is no real actual control or intention or.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
 Clairvoyance.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
 I use the word.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
 I think so.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 You're talking that I will use the clairvoyance.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
 We're talking about awareness, right?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
 Awareness is clarity.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 Yes.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
 Clarity.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 And then I use the also require is a clairvoyance.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 So what, what, what, what means clairvoyance?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
 You tell me.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.000
 It's my understanding that clairvoyance would be an awareness of things

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
 beyond what other people would be aware of, first of all, in a conventional

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
 sense.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 And that would be, for example, what might be going to happen, or what people

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
 might be seeing.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 Oh, okay.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 Then, then I'm sorry.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 I should use the wrong word.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 Clairvoyance.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
 I shouldn't use clairvoyance.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 I just use, I should use require as clarity.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 Clarity.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
 Clarity.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 So an understanding, so that it would be an understanding of things.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.000
 The require is clarity, but all of the require can make the clairvoyance.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
 Require is clarity.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 Require is clarity means require has systems.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
 Require is systems.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
 That require can make the clairvoyance of the future or whatever, as you said.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 But if you view that as clairvoyance, haven't you just created duality?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
 Yes, it is dualities.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 Definitely, the clairvoyance then as the prediction of all this is dualities.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 But this is a duality, something useful.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
 But isn't it more useful to live the moment and not have duality?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 Well, this is better to have no dualities.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
 But then duality is not something that, again, it's okay teaching.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
 We should not think duality is enemy.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
 Oh, not enemy.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
 No, the duality is obstacle.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
 The deception.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 Yes, duality is a person.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
 Deluded.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 Yes, deluded.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 Isn't it kind of like teetering on the rig of falling back over?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 Yes, yes, right.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000
 But if you can stay beyond the duality, duality, if you have that capabilities,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 that is wonderful.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
 Is this, again, a matter of balance?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
 Say that again.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
 Can you keep your balance on a razor blade, you know, on the head of a pen?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.000
 But when you don't have duality, when you are out of duality, definitely you are balanced.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
 Definitely you are balanced because duality is one who is making unbalance.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 But if you are free from the duality, then definitely you are.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
 I don't understand how you state it.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
 If you're looking at clear points, how you know?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
 No, I'm not talking about clear points.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
 I'm sorry.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
 I shouldn't use the word clear points.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 I use clarity.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
 Clarity, clarity status.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 But receiving clarity as a future understandings.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
 No, the future understandings.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 That's fine.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 For example, this is not called duality.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 This is the omniscient or the clear points.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
 But because of the knowledge of the wisdom they have, they can tell.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 But for them, it's not dualities.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 What means duality, actually?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
 What means duality?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 Duality is dividing the moment into anything but the moment.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
 Okay, I think I will say, of course it's true.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
 What do you say it's true?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:34.000
 But duality means attachment, clinging, clinging, clinging, clinging.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.710
 But Buddhas, in light of being, even this test says all these different things on the relative

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:41.000
 level.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
 It's not talking about grasping and clinging.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
 This is why you need to teach, right?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 So you can get confidence in these things.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
 This is why one needs a teacher, right?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 That's true.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 The teacher is always good.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 The teacher is a spiritual friend who can help assist or qualify.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.600
 The teacher is a spiritual friend who can actually practice on the right path and all the way to

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.000
 the Buddha.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
 And therefore, the Buddha says the teaching.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
 The teacher says, "Oh, Hari Buddha, until you reach enlightenment,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 you should always contract to the spiritual friend."

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
 I think I need a friend.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
 That's it, of course. I need two.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:34.000
 If I understood you correctly,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
 when you were discussing this present mind,

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
 what are the qualities you said?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
 Was it free from the traces of the past?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 In light of that, could you say something a little bit about memory

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
 and how that functions with the present mind?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
 No, this memory is, again, part of the intelligence.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
 Part of the intelligence, which is wonderful.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
 Memories are always that.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
 But when you look into the nature of the present mind,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
 the present mind, when you are staying to the present mind,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
 or when you are in the present mind status,

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
 when you look to the past mind,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
 where the past mind went.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 So, what answer do we have about the past mind?

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 Mind.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
 And when there is no answer to the past mind,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
 therefore, in the teaching also said,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
 even there is not just about the present mind where you went,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
 but even there is no trail,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
 trail or the trace of the past mind.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
 Mind went.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
 Because past mind means something went, right?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 Something is gone.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
 So, if there is any trail of that past mind...

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
 That's what I'm saying.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
 Potentially, you could say that memory is...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
 But that is a recollecting of the conceptions,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
 your thought, which is good.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 But the real...

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
 Is there a restriction between the past and the mind itself?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 Yeah, but it's a recollectment of the past memories.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
 Past memories, of course, that is called your wisdom.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
 The wisdom is there, memories are there.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
 But we're looking to the present status.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 We're not looking to the past memories or any of those.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
 But we're looking to the right standard on the present state of our awareness,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 and then look to our past mind.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
 Past mind, this present moment is past.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
 Past few minutes ago, where that mind went?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
 Where that mind went?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
 If you look to that mind,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 if not just we have the answer of the mind where it went,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000
 but even if there is some trace that we can follow or trail of that,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
 there is even that not there.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 That is what's talking, not the memories.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
 Of course, also if the memory level is the same thing,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
 memory, of course, is important, but where is memory?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
 If you look to the memory itself, self,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 again, what is this?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 I mean, nature is pervasive.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
 This is not something that we can go or do something different.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 Again, memories, where is memories?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 Memories and what?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
 Of course, memories we collect.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
 Yesterday, I did all these things.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
 We collect that.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
 But where is this?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
 Everything now?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
 I mean, this answer is the same.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
 Or the result is the same.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Nature is the same.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
 Okay?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:49.000
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
 And there's one place that there were,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
 says we talk about ground path and fruition dualistically

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
 as if three things.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
 These are like levels of space.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
 So there's no rule.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
 So could you say then that the past, the present, and the future,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
 in our mind we think there are three things.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
 But really it's just like in space,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
 we can't say past, present, future because it's all connected.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
 There is no, there's no complete past, there's no complete future.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
 And even the present moment, we can't grasp it.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
 That's really true.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
 I mean, that's true.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
 Who can say it's not true to Moharrambhuji?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 Moharrambhuji is true, exactly.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
 Really true, that's true.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
 I mean, not just because Moharrambhuji said we believe in that,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
 but this is what is ground.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 I mean, of course, always in the teaching said,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
 said that ground path and a result.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
 Or in the debate said, [INAUDIBLE]

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 said, what is that?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000
 It's all talking about this rupa, rupa.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
 And ground is a rupa, and the path is a rupa,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
 and the result is a rupa.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 And where is a rupa?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
 Then Moharrambhuji said, it's like making different kind

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
 of levels of the skies.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
 Skies, this and that things.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
 It's just old.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
 But we need this, even though they're dead.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 But for us, duality level, because that's

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
 what we're going to actualize this natural realization

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
 with that understanding, that framework.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
 That's what the teaching said.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 The skillful means-- this skillful means a way

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
 to usher us to that path.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
 And then finally, we explore.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
 All is the same.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.500
 And not just the only ground path is the same,

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.000
 but all the samsara and the rana is the same.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
 Then it's called inseparable status

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 of the samsara and the rana.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
 Yes, please.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:04.000
 To direct cognition, or direct experience, direct knowing,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 if I can discriminate or allow to fall away all the five skandhas

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 and have direct cognition, isn't that of a self?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
 And in Buddhism, you talk about there being no actual self.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
 And yet, the one who experiences direct cognition,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
 if not the one who experiences it.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.000
 I'm going to make phone call, trying to--

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
 trying to make phone call.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 I don't know.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
 Line is always busy and can't reach.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 So I don't know.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 I mean, the answer will come.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 But this direct valid cognition--

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
 cognitions and this is no self--

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
 is actually, of course, is all the teachings.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
 But direct valid cognition is talking more

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
 from everything of this.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
 It will be looked at more on the relative true levels.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 Relative levels.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 No self is in absolute levels.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 And in the relative level, definitely we have self.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
 And relative level means what?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
 Illusion levels.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
 Illusion level, we have self.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
 We have you.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 We have I.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
 We have mountain.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
 We have tree.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 And that's what even the Buddha said.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
 I'm going to go Varanasi.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 I'm going to go to the Buddha Gaya.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
 I'm going to go with Charlie.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
 And then bring me this bowl of water or something.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
 I mean, see those.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
 Those are all the relative levels.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
 Relative levels.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
 So relative level, definitely we have the direct

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
 valid cognition, which is going to explore

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
 that absolute level as no self.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 Self.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 So the direct valid cognition on the relative level,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000
 definitely you're going to discover

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
 one valid cognition, that on the relative level

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
 of your eye or self.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
 You understand, right?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 How would it be ever possible to comment about

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
 an absolute reality if there wasn't the capacity to do that?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
 How?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
 Say that again.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000
 How would one ever even have a consideration

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
 about an absolute reality except from the vantage point

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
 of being someone?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
 No, that is when on the relative level,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 for example, you ask yourself, self, yourself,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
 when you're meditating, as we're exploring today,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 for example, this, and when you don't have any answers

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
 of this, this, and that is really according Buddhism,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 that is zoking level.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
 You reach to the point.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
 You really reach to the absolute levels.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
 And absolute is only going to behold through the meditation.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
 And then your meditation becomes stronger and stronger,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 then there is nothing to make divisions between

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
 the absolute relative.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
 All is the same.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
 Same.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
 Therefore, now for us, we have the duality,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 we have this division, so therefore we're going to work

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 with the joyful effort, devotion, and bodhicata,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
 and really strongly kind of maintaining that

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 and explore the natural as we discover,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
 try to make stronger and stronger and deeper and deeper.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 And then finally, then you see all is just

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 in one great economic status.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
 Thank you.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
 Thank you.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
 Yes, thank you.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
 Thank you very much for your talk.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 Thank you.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 I would like to just summarize, if you don't mind,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.000
 saying that to my mind, the only confusion that ever happens

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 is because we are afraid to go beyond the mind of concept.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
 Mm-hmm.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
 That's really true.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
 Many times we are very scared.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
 For example, that's what the Buddhist teaching,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
 Buddha's teaching, there are six paramatas.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
 What's it called?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
 The six paramatas among the third paramata is what?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
 Patient paramata.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
 Patient paramata.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
 And the patient paramata is the one known as

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
 then have the courage and confidence,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 confidence on the nature of the mind or nature.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
 Many times we're scared because the duality mind

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
 or the ego-cling or the self is always like to hold something.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
 Always.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
 So when we are releasing that trouble,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
 it really brings and therefore Buddha gives the teachings

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
 according to the readiness of the teachings.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
 And really Buddha lay out that Buddha didn't give all the way,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
 every teaching immediately that he pointed out

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
 possible noble truth, which is very suitable,

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
 which is very carnal-like.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
 It's just exactly where the world is.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
 And so Kaggle there and then gradually Buddha lead.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
 Lead to that.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
 So therefore it's true what you said.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
 Thank you very much.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
 Okay.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 Thank you.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
 Then we do short meditation.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
 And then we again do short dedication.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
 I'm going to do some prayers.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 So join your intention with my prayers.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
