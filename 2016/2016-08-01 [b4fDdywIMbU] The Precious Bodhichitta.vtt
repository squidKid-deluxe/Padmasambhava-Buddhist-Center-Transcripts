00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 I mean, you all know, the prayers of bodhichitta, in those without it, may it be generated.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.520
 In those who have it, may it never diminish it, but always continually increase it.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.360
 This is the aspiration prayer of the bodhichitta of compassion. I mean, you know that.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.840
 We all know that's what we do.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.880
 And this is the precious bodhichitta. It's the precious bodhichitta.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.480
 Why is it precious? I already said yesterday, the benefit and power of the bodhichitta,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.600
 there's nothing higher and bigger and better and deeper than the bodhichitta.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.920
 Every good thing is what we call known as in the nirvana. Every good thing is in the nirvana,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 what we are talking, enlightenment, arata, Buddhahood, and bodhisattvas, and all that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.520
 All is developed from this. All is developed from this. Nothing is came out of this.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.800
 Therefore, it's so precious, so special, so extraordinary, yet it's so ordinary.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 No one is out of this darkness. We all have this nature. Everyone, no one is out of this.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.320
 It's ordinary, it's ordinary, it's real, it's simple. It's just the way things are.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.240
 That's the nature it is. This is the precious bodhichitta.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.760
 It's not just only heavy is enough, now we have to activate it after.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.120
 Activated this. We have to bring that. We have to bring that sizzling status, sizzle status.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.800
 Bring it out. That's it. That's what He said. Those we don't eat, may it be generated.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.480
 How we generated that? That's what I've been talking, we've been discussing.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 Poor, boundless. Poor, boundless is the way to activating, glorifying, sizzling, bring it out.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.170
 Out, that is poor, boundless. And poor, boundless, I mention, and you know it's not just, I mention

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.720
 it.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:38.240
 Love, compassion. Compassion, joy, or reduce, joy or reduces, and equanimities.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:47.120
 These are poor, I've been talking for boundless. But at the same time, we all have this.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 It's not again out of range. We're not talking something that only Buddha has, or great bodhisattva

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.520
 has.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:05.760
 We all have this. We all have this. But how we have now ourself is limited. Limited.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 Our love is limited. Our compassion is limited. Our joy or reduce is limited.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:22.240
 Our equanimity and equality is limited. By who? How that happened? Because due to the duality,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.080
 due to the ego clinging, due to the self-important and self-centered mind, whatever we name,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:39.520
 because of that is limited. Where those came from is all came from our own mind.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.280
 Therefore, what is those named in the Buddha's teaching? Delusions. It is delusions.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:57.680
 It's delusions. We hold on to that. When we hold on to that, what is known as grasping, clinging.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.280
 Where is grasping? Where is clinging? Again, there is nothing existing. No substantial, solid,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:14.080
 entity grasping, clinging does not exist at all. Its self is delusions. Its self is diluted.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.920
 Deluded, we hold. Who is supported to hold that? Grasping itself is supported to grasping.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.760
 It's maintaining, upholding. It continues that. There's nothing else coming outside to uphold

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:37.520
 and helping support to keep that. It's one's own creations. Therefore, we have to release.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.640
 We have to relax. We have to release that not, not or typed. Who did that first place? We did.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.920
 And now how we have to release that? Or release the not? Not. We have to do. Ourself have to do.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.600
 Each and individually have to do that. For that reason, what the greatest teacher Buddha said,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.080
 "I showed you the technique. It's now up to you how to do it." It's not something that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.320
 Buddha can do this and that things. And what Buddha can do, Buddha did a long time ago to us.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.160
 Buddha is full of compassion, full of love, and full of concern and thought to all living beings.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.960
 Buddha did or Buddha did long time ago. But one's own did. We have to clean by one's own side.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.320
 It's our responsibility. We're not going to ask him, "Well, do something there." Kind of believe

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.480
 him

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:47.000
 onto that. That is not right. Everything what we're doing in the samsara, samsara, even in the sams

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.440
ara,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.440
 we do ourself. We are our responsibilities. It's our ability. No one is really, even though we

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.360
 have all security, ensuring all these different things, but at the reality level, I have to take

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.610
 care of myself. Nobody really has the capability to take care and handle that. Even if they wanted

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.080
 to.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.480
 It's the same way. Same way. We have to bring out these qualities. We have to maintain

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.000
 for that is what it is. For example, poor boundaries. We have to make this prison time

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.040
 is limited and with boundaries. We have to break that boundaries. We have to release that

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:40.720
 every direction. And let that love and compassion, the joys and equanimity shine to every direction

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:48.720
 as a building sign without any boundaries, without any distractions. When we do this,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:58.400
 as I said yesterday, then it becomes limitless. Limitless, boundless, boundless. And your love

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:08.000
 and where your heart is opening is boundless, limitless. And vastness and where it's reaching

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 to all the sentient beings without any discrimination is limitless. All sentient beings are

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.480
 limitless,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:24.400
 limitless, boundless. There's no numbers. So your opening is boundless. Where it's reaching out

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.040
 is boundless or limitless. And then benefit in the teaching set. And benefit and the result is

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:39.280
 limitless. Benefit, the power, what you're really doing, something that you never did or we never

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:47.520
 did by ego, cleanliness. Today we are directing our ego. We are directing our self-importance.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.160
 We are directing self-centered mind, breaking that wall, that regimen, that convergence

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.160
 and opening clearly to all living beings. That is about wondrous, how beautiful it is,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.240
 how speakerly it is. This is the way to go, to help you to all the sentient beings. That's what

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.280
 we take the journey of today enlightenment of Buddhism. So this is the one of the teachings.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.480
 First is here, pastors' love. Then second is compassion. And third is reduce and forth is joy.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.000
 I mean I said no. But according to the teaching, according when it comes to the practice level,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.160
 many great masters in the practice of lineage mentioned first you should activate more

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.960
 equanimities. Equanimity is very important. Equanimity will balance you. So our love and

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:47.120
 compassion, joy and the reduce are not become emotions. And then if it's become emotion,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.880
 then again we're making grasping and clinging. Clinging is not good enough. It's not good enough

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.120
 for us to help you to the beings. Therefore, this equality thought. So that means love and

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.360
 compassion is balanced. Love is balanced on the compassion. Sorry, love is balanced in the

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:15.280
 equanimity or love is best on the equanimity. Compassion is best on the equanimity and the

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:23.840
 reduce and joy is best on the equanimity. And we do this that way. And we practice with that. Then

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.600
 love becomes pure. Compassion becomes pure. And the reduce and joy becomes pure. And then it's

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.280
 completely blended in perfectly. It's benefiting to all the beings. At the same time, we are

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.480
 cleansing and purifying our obscurations, obstacles. With this beautiful balance in the

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.560
 equanimity and kind of understanding, and then do the practice. Start with love and kindness,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:57.680
 as teaching said. Love. Love and taking over the sentient beings. So this is what I'm

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.960
 told to kind of talk a little bit about that. And that's so here. How are we going to keep this?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:11.440
 Okora, again, this, this, this, this, this sentence. "In those without it, may it generate it." So

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.080
 that is what is generating. Poor, boundless. Bring up that. That will make the generating the body

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:26.160
 channels. And now those who have the body channels are generating that. And then third one here is,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:36.960
 "Those who have it, may it never demolish it." How does it demolish it? Again, due to our habit

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:45.900
 patterns and grasping, that ego or self-important, self-centered mind is always around our, our

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.160
 things.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.200
 And that is demolishing. Whenever that's happening, or for that reason, always increasing.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:06.020
 Always keep up the poor, boundless. Always keep up the poor, boundless. How to also to grow up that

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.160
?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:13.920
 How to maintain that? Then we did, such as actualizing both each other. As I said yesterday,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.960
 whenever you know, actualizing both each other with these six paramata practices.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:26.960
 You do kind of kept the six paramata practices with it. With this poor, boundless thought, it will

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:34.160
 maintain, keep the stabilizer both each other. At the same time, it is bring growth in the

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.720
 development,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.760
 development. And how it will bring development? And that is then, by always continuing increasing.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:50.160
 Always, then it will increase. The increase, always increasing and developing and advancing,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:57.600
 advancing, part 10 booming, all those Buddha teaching makers that will grow that. And again,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.880
 to summarize that, to bring that, summarize again one more how this is what in the teaching system.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:11.360
 See, what Buddha put so simple and beautiful, something that we can really, we can kind of keep

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:18.400
 that in the mind, what in here it is. Again in Dharmapala Freya we have this, this is the essence

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:27.200
 teaching of the Buddha. Buddha said, do not engage in any negative activities. Do not engage in any

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:35.840
 negative activities. And the practicing will choose it perfectly. Completely should you get your

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.160
 own

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:49.120
 mind. This is teaching of the Buddha or this is teaching of Buddha. So that is the one. Again,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.000
 to simplify this. Again, how to maintain this bodhicitta. Again, how to do this?

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:06.560
 And that is, do not engage in any negative activities. Negative activity is resolved.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:15.040
 Resolved. Resolved or is proved, for example, proved. What is cause of negative activities?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.520
 We discussed the other day or said quite a few times. Cause of negative is nothing but

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:30.640
 negative emotions. Negative emotions. What are those? Ignorance, attachment, and anger.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:39.440
 Those activities. And then the others, in error and so forth. That these are the cause of negative

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.520
 activities. And where they come from again? It's the same thing. It's all the time from mind.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:53.600
 Mind. And then these all negatives, even called negatives, they are not substantial solid existing.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.800
 They are again just an energy, evaporation of the mind. In other words, no. There is no substantial

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.040
 solid existing. Every you really analyze them is getting through an analytic or they exam that.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:16.480
 Exam that intellectually, where is that? It's all creation of the mind. Said, why is it all

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.960
 negative?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:26.720
 I make it so many times and you know, because it is unwholesome. It is hurting you, my son,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:36.800
 and hurting others. Others. And that's why it's called negatives. It is creating

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:45.760
 unpleasant environment to me or to myself and to the others. It don't bring peace, happiness,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:56.480
 joy. It won't bring. Therefore, it's known as negatives. So for that reason, being as practitioners

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.480
,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:04.720
 we're trying to really always thoughtful with our mind and our actions.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.880
 That is what the Buddha said here. That is what the Buddha is going to say. The negative

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.440
 is going to hurt me, hurt my friend, my family, and everyone. And so therefore,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:26.560
 I try to be thoughtful with this, that is. And then action is louder than thinking.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.820
 It's reflecting to outside. That definitely will hurt every color. So that is what really the

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.040
 Buddha

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:41.440
 saying. Should not do any negative activities. And we can definitely should do not any negative

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:49.920
 activities. Even we cannot do, but we should try to remember teaching and try to remember

00:15:49.920 --> 00:16:00.480
 the benefit or the consequence of that. And if we do that, what is known as in Buddhism

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:12.240
 called practitioners. Buddha's teaching never mentioned any places violence is good. Any name,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:22.720
 what even names, there is no any violence. And that is what it should not do. If anything is

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.960
 violent, it best on the emotions. It best on the negative emotions. What are those negative

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:40.320
 emotions? Again, ignoring is fundamental, attachment, angle, and arrogance, and jealous.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:49.920
 Jealous and combination of that. Performing this. So you should not do any negative activities.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.920
 And then do the virtues practice perfectly or practice virtues perfectly. What is virtues?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:09.280
 The virtues is, is then again, it has cause, it has content. Virtues itself is like result,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:18.800
 result of fruit. The cause of virtues is good heart, simple Buddha. Good heart, best upon the

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.840
 true love, true compassion, true wisdom. For that reason, Grand Master Navarajana said in his

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:39.440
 teaching, once said, when your detachment and no anger and no ignorance is the virtues. That

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:48.720
 is the virtues. Whatever comes from that, it is known as the head virtues. So, perform the virtues

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.600
 actively. And where these virtues and all these virtues clip on? Again, it's from mind. It's not

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:04.400
 really any outside that is. It's all about our mind. Mind, and you reveal that virtues. Let that

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:12.800
 shine, let that come out. And in order to do this, in order to do this, the most important is then

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:22.640
 he has it. Completely subjugating your own mind. Subjugating your own mind. What that subjugating

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:31.680
 means? Subjugating the ego clinging, subjugating the self-important, subjugating the substantial

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:40.160
 mind. And we focus with that subjugating the attachment and anger and the yellows and arrogance.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:48.720
 Subjugating. When you're trying to, how are we to subjugate that? Also, if we don't follow after

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:56.080
 that, even if it arises in our mind, but if we don't follow, activate that. That is how we're

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.480
 subduing, subduing, we're reducing the stance. That means when you don't follow after that,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.640
 that means you got intelligence. What's done is coming through. What's done is coming.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.760
 And then you start. You didn't follow after that. What happened at that point?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:23.360
 Thought, negative thoughts. Then it's liberated. According to doctor teaching,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:30.560
 liberated. According to medical teaching, subjugate it. You subjugate power of the wrath

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:37.600
 of your compassion, power of the wrath of yourlessness. You really subjugate it. Subjugate it.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.160
 That is what he says. And through that, then he increases this, both each other. Always, always,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.840
 as much as we can. With the great joy, the great apprehension, there's nothing better and

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:57.040
 beautiful, beautiful gift to my own self in this life, in the future life, more than both each

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.360
 other.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:05.440
 So really recognize, call it, and important how precious it is, and always glorifying and doing,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.320
 following that in that light. And that is known as, then, in the Buddha's teaching,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:16.640
 the other Buddha's teaching, Bodhisattvas, male and female. And even bodhisattva, when you call

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:27.040
 those practitioners, noble son and noble daughters, they're novelists, truly, who follow that,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:34.770
 who practice that. So that is what is known as the purple of compassion, the pearl of the body,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.360
 just

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:42.000
 that. So that is really, I just talked about that, so with this text, we have bodhima and we find

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.320
 this

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.830
 every day, so every time, every time. So I thought, even though I mean, you know this is not

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.080
 something

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.480
 not annoying about that, but you know, so I thought to talk that really. And then, now,
