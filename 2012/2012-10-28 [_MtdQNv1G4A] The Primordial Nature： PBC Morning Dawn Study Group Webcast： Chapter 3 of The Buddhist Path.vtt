00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Welcome to the third webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group at Padma Samye Ling. So today

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.360
 we'll be discussing the third chapter of Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches' book, "The Buddhist Path",

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.040
 and the chapter is entitled "The Primordial Nature". So we'll begin with opening prayers and then

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.200
 we'll

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:32.160
 go into the discussion.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:11.680
 The Supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padma Sambala, which is the essential,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 extraordinary viewing doctrine of the early translation school. You keep alive and spread

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.680
 by the light of wisdom. Lord of dharma, great Khenpo, I pray at your lotus feet. In the palace

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 of the old man Dhammadattu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the one who shows

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.920
 clearly the dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honourable Rupur, a glorious true teacher,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 precious one, dwelling on the lotus seat on the crown of my head. Hold me with your great kindness,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.000
 bestow the accomplishments of body, speech and mind.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:40.960
 Thanks everybody. So we divided this chapter, "The Primordial Nature" into three sections,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.800
 and so there's three points, one point for each section of the chapter, and so we'll hit these

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.520
 points one by one, and so more or less we're dividing the chapter into thirds. So I'll just

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.240
 give a really quick overview of the first section of this chapter, and then we'll go right to the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.640
 point. So for this first part of the chapter, Rinpoche's are distinguished between the way things

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.840
 appear and the way they are, and the way things appear is relative truth, and the way things are

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.320
 is absolute truth, and so when we hold on to our concepts about how things appear, this is not the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.400
 absolute truth of how things really are, and so on the absolute level of how things are, the nature

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.320
 of everything is the same, and when we hold on to the limitations of our own perceptions, as if

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.800
 they're truly real, meaning they have no limitation, then we're mistaken. By grasping onto our

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.280
 limited

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.880
 perceptions, as compared to children believing that they're games, that they play are real.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.720
 So when we understand our experience without any limitations or grasping, then that is realizing

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.000
 absolute truth, which is called enlightenment, and then they go on to say that our normal awareness

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.440
 is based on habits, and so grasping onto these habits will not lead to a fuller understanding

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.440
 or enlightenment, but it will only make our habits stronger, and so who is making these habits, who

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.760
 these judgments, conceptions, perceptions, we feel that I am making these, and who is this I, and

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.720
 I is one's own mind, and then they say then look to one's own mind, when we do this we can't find

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.800
 a truly existent solid real object which is our mind, and not finding that solidly existing mind

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.680
 is called emptiness, and so then they say this emptiness doesn't mean that it's nothingness or

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.640
 non-existence, because the mind is constantly moving. When awareness, our mind moves based on

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.960
 habits, this is called confused habitual mind, and when our awareness moves without being

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.600
 restricted

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.240
 by any habits, the Rinpoche is called this clarity. So these beautiful expressions of our mind when

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.120
 it's not grasping include things like love, compassion, and wisdom, and so then this is

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.440
 more or less the first third of this chapter, and so then if someone would read this point which is

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.680
 related here, and discuss. If we look carefully at the mind we begin to understand its nature,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.320
 when we look for the mind we discover how difficult it is to find, we cannot put it in our hands,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.200
 we cannot see it or its nature, the mind is a vast emptiness called shunyata or great emptiness,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.160
 the emptiness nature does not mean that it is blank or a black hole, the mind has many beautiful

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.320
 qualities like clarity and wisdom, yet these qualities are inseparable from emptiness.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:47.760
 Anyone have any opening remarks to this topic? Particularly later on in that paragraph when

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.960
 they talk about the emptiness nature, it doesn't mean that it's blank or a black hole. I was

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.920
 wondering if actually if you and Lya and you're going to speak more to that because I know many

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.440
 of times when someone's new to talking about particularly emptiness, the word emptiness itself

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.480
 kind of catches them because it always seems like the first thing is to go to that thought of blank

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.950
 or void, so maybe if people could speak more to that I think it'd be really useful for a lot of

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.280
 people.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.080
 Definitely what is it empty of? When we look to see the mind then we're looking for a mind that's

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.400
 really truly there as if there's an object there that we can find. So what is the shape? Is it a

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.340
 thing? How big is it? Where is it? Let's say if we look for the mind like that then we don't find

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.640
 it

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:46.560
 and so instead what do we find? This constant changing awareness, this love or compassion,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.010
 there's always our mind is always there, concepts are always happening, thoughts are always

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.440
 happening,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.880
 there's always expression even if there's not a solid fixed anything there that's the source of

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.440
 that expression. So they say it's full of love and compassion, it's infinitely expressive of those

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.720
 goodness qualities but if you look where is there that actual fixed source of this me or this some

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.600
 kind of fixed core of them then we don't find them and the thing which is that is empty of that

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.000
 fixed

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.440
 the fixedness. What do you think?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.360
 So what is the condition area? Okay so that's point two so we'll hold off on the conditioning part.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:58.890
 I think here like on page 20 they say emptiness is a source of all mental activity and all

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.280
 movements

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.600
 of the mind are pervaded by primordial awareness. The primordial nature of the mind is not separate

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.960
 from the relative phenomenon we perceive right now and then later they say the Buddha and all other

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.720
 great masters taught that there is nothing to acquire externally. It is only a matter of working

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.000
 to reveal what we already have. So I thought it might be worth just like on that same note to say

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.880
 like primordial the chapter is called primordial nature. So what does primordial mean? It means

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.880
 always less you know it means never has not been a primordial nature it always has been forever.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.320
 So everything is the primordial nature in the sense of even the habit patterns and even everything

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:54.320
 else is a display actually in the Vajrayana view in the Tibetan Buddhism of that nature of that

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.240
 emptiness nature because it's never separate from that. Like they said it's not separate from the

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.800
 relative phenomena we perceive right now and it's not an enlightenment it's not something we'll get

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:12.160
 outside of ourselves. Anyway just a thought as far as what is the nature means is something that's

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.150
 there all the time and primordial means always was and it means like you can't escape the prim

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.440
ordial

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.200
 nature. So I guess I'll keep you back with that question how would how do you see that relating

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.480
 to that to that use of the word empty particularly you know when we're talking about primordial you

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:40.000
 know people I mean Rinpoche's and so many great teachers they all talk about that that fullness

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.840
 quality in that emptiness you know so I think you know well one thing is like emptiness in one

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.240
 sense

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.800
 emptiness is not a thing that's another way of looking at it right emptiness is not like here

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.200
 in the corner of the room is emptiness everywhere else is something solid and substantial that's

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:05.040
 not empty it's absolutely real in the sense of it's tangible like this so from that perspective

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:12.560
 it's like emptiness is not something separate from what appears what appears nature of what appears

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.080
 and also because of like just touching on that primordial there isn't anything that we need to

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:28.640
 do or can do even to make it that way make it empty that is its nature so like you know it's

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.960
 just an interesting thing to think you know we're practicing we're trying to recognize that and

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.200
 through our meditation practice but it is that way you know whether we see it or not it is that way

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.320
 what do you so I guess that so for people who are new coming to this then

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.800
 what's what's something that would be useful particularly when they're when they're grappling

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 with with just even the word emptiness or the concept emptiness what what's a kind of a gentle

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.600
 way of coming into that understanding or right about the word openness

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:15.440
 open this up the same one I don't know openness that there's there's just that there's lots of

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:30.400
 there's lots of room flexibility maybe but no I think flexibility you could but I think more

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:40.240
 that quality openness empty you know empty like you're saying has connotations of in here like

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:46.400
 when she's mentioned in the paragraph there's it's not black hole but like we're saying really is

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:56.160
 empty of substantially existing something okay so that in that quality of everything that's

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.040
 arising the quality of our mind and then when we investigate appearances carefully using our logic

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:10.960
 and then applying that in our meditation and we can maybe begin to at least on an intellectual

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.640
 level see that the openness of the situation on any level we're really looking at it

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.680
 that it's not fixed as any one particular thing that it's only that thing

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.320
 but it's an open there's that open quality and then of course an inseparable from that open

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:39.440
 quality are these beautiful qualities of clarity arising energy of compassion and intelligence

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.520
 and wisdom that are inherent to the mind and here we're dualistic beings connecting with these two

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:56.400
 aspects but they're one thing but that's further I think discussion and study and contemplation and

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.040
 meditation I'm not sure where that time I mean that's definitely good to talk about

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.200
 and I think definitely I would say that like something that I found really helpful is this

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 what is it empty of if you look to the mind what is it empty of if you look outside of phenomena

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.600
 what is it empty of and like and that's in the chapter when I said it's empty of a true existence

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.040
 so then say what is true existence and it's always defined as if something truly exists

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:36.160
 it would be singular independent permanent so if something really truly exists it should be

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.040
 singular

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.160
 not have any parts it should be independent and not depend on anything else for it to be the way

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.040
 it is causing conditions not dependent on causing conditions and it would be permanent unchanging

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:53.600
 unaffected by anything so singular independent permanent that would that would be the definition

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.680
 of true existence and if we look for the mind we feel it's really there this me this I is really

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.840
 there let me say look to the mind and find that look outside and find something that's singular

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.600
 independent permanent and if we find that then it'd be truly existing and so it's saying it's

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:18.640
 empty of being able to find anything like that when we look so that's really the test can we

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:25.520
 find something like that because we might feel there's something like that but can we really

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.600
 if we look let's look can we find it

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:39.280
 and then I guess another another question then that kind of falls within this paragraph

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:46.720
 it it seems one of one of the tendencies when someone who's newer starts looking at emptiness

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.680
 it almost seems like it's jumping right over a little bit into nihilism which I think we've

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.000
 addressed a little bit in the fact that we're saying what is it actually empty of but you know

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.080
 if someone's you know trying to you know think about what what makes this not nihilism what

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.440
 were some points that I think or what are some points that you you all would think that would

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.480
 would come in handy or some something for people to contemplate on that would that would keep them

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.240
 into that balance and not dip over into the nihilistic I got I got a point was like

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:25.200
 define nihilism first yeah sure what does maybe you say since you're saying

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:32.160
 when we talk about like the two extremes you have the eternalism where there is that that fixed

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.640
 thing

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.840
 that you know is unchanging which we we counteract with the singular independent and plural not or

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.320
 permanent thing but but then also on the other end of the spectrum is nihilism which is

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:53.280
 nothing exists and therefore there's there's no karma there's no causes and conditions and

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.440
 nothing truly happening which which tends to lead to this idea that whatever I do doesn't matter

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.880
 and sometimes they define nihilism too as a belief in the not in the continuity of mind

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:14.680
 so when the body dies mind stops they say that is that's nihilism that basically they equate nihil

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:14.800
ism

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.320
 a lot of times with material only believing in those things which you can tangibly see

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.840
 and not believing in the continuity of anything more subtle of anything more subtle or awareness

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:34.320
 so well I think like on that question in the same as point one if we think of the emptiness of mind

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:43.120
 we can think of like um if you look to the mind like it says here we can't we can't put our hands

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.280
 on it because it doesn't have a simple location like this book has a simple location where like

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.360
 of some point on a map we kind of can see and locate it in space and time but awareness itself

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:05.600
 you can't really just pinpoint exactly where it is but yet but yet we all obviously have awareness

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.600
 awareness is present right now that's why we can have a conversation and because anything can arise

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.800
 in that awareness that's why we can have any different thought memories of the past you know

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.080
 think about the future conceptualize the present the whole reason why we can do that is emptiness

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:32.880
 I mean because awareness is present it's empty awareness it's it's totally open anything can

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.320
 happen within that awareness within the space of mind but yet when you try to pinpoint it

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:45.360
 you can't find any location at all you can't put your hands on it so that counters well

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.840
 eternalism and nihilism because awareness is obviously present you know and it's something

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.440
 continuous because we have that sense but yet when we pinpoint it we can't make it into something

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.440
 solid and substantial yeah I've always deeply appreciated how when we're Bache talks about

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.600
 emptiness you know many times they'll say emptiness awareness or and you know there's

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.680
 there's always that qualifier that that brings in that quality you know even though we're we're

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.760
 using the word emptiness which for so many people is charged he's always very mindful to bring in

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.320
 what's what's the quality that arises out of that emptiness you know what's what's the quality that

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.480
 even though it's not fixed arises or as they they say here the mind has many beautiful qualities

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.600
 like clarity and wisdom yet these qualities are inseparable from that emptiness that's always

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:43.120
 I deeply appreciate you know how very very clearly that gets highlighted I think

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:52.000
 good it was similar to what a man was saying earlier about how to or and also what Andrew how

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.600
 it's not some far out thing of course the more we look and depending on ours clarity of mind

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.800
 then we maybe see deeper and deeper and deeper and that's the whole path to enlightenment

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.920
 but right now as things are you know if we use like all these beautiful tools buddha gave us

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:19.440
 we can't deny we're having an experience and yet when we look at the mind look back at the mind

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:27.920
 that's seen what can we find when we look out at outer phenomena and examine how it's all working

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:36.240
 and functions and things but when we really look at how is that working we we find that's a

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:47.520
 it really isn't magical it's uh mysterious it's so it is like this is vivid you know and yet if

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:55.600
 if I look back at the mind that's observing this and try to find that that's hard if we when we

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:03.120
 really look at on even just just playing outer physical substance the more we look there's nothing

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.840
 substantially existing looking deep deep deep into it so I think that's another thing it's

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:17.040
 not some far out thing it's actually right here and now what we're experiencing in a way I mean

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:23.760
 maybe that's too vague also I don't know but but that vividness like our that what the buddha is

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:31.760
 talking about is our the experience we're having right now and from this experience right now

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:39.200
 whether we look back at the subject out at the object we can find that openness and that like

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:48.160
 insubstantial like mirage like amazing illusion you know magical display like it said I mean

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.800
 and yet it is it's so vivid and we have feelings we have perceptions we can talk we can

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.480
 do all kinds of things and perceive things and things can be out of our control or you know

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.240
 but yet that's not different than anything else that's all part of the nature too

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.600
 so I think that's a step to that what we're talking about but the buddha is talking about

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.200
 it's not separate from the experience we're having right now I guess that part too that

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.160
 it's vivid and yet when we really look it's open it's there's that

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:31.280
 just about like now like we're just talking about practicing now as we meditate and you know the

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.680
 point is initially particularly to calm the mind and then so you know most beginners beginning

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.800
 to practice calming the mind and looking at the mind often they remark oh wow it's just so much

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 more wild you know so that's pretty obvious in that moment particularly oh there is it's not

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.960
 look like emptiness you know there's all this all this activity all this arising you know in our

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.960
 minds you know outside that how we're perceiving things I mean it's just very clearly not look

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.640
 like you know black holes and then you know just continually along the path it's you know I think

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.520
 maybe that's a mistake you know that I definitely made in the beginning as I first started

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:13.840
 practicing

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.080
 oh you're thinking it's supposed to be that way so it's supposed to be emptiness this flat like no

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:27.280
 thoughts you know trying to like dump out you know what all these qualities which is just

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:27.920
 ridiculous

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:35.040
 in a way you know pretty quickly you realize that's that's not going to happen even if you want it

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.200
 to

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.160
 happen like they're just naturally like this paragraph the mind has many beautiful qualities

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.560
 and they're naturally arising qualities and you know we can try all we want but it's kind of

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.680
 silly if you think about it trying to kind of hold in those beautiful qualities so anyway

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.680
 seeing more and more clearly more and more directly than the nature of those qualities

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:08.240
 yeah that seems yeah I think particularly in talking about the oh I'm sorry no that was good

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.920
 one more I think this it segues nicely into that into the second paragraph and the fact that like

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.720
 okay so what are we not so much the empty qualities but then what are all these concepts like I

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.040
 think

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.680
 the second paragraph highlights that nicely so I don't know if you want to yeah I agree yeah thanks

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.840
 um yep so then the second section of this chapter just to quickly like go over the bullet points so

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.680
 we all kind of are on the same page with it before we hit the second topic um surbitures

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.880
 are saying that when our mind goes to hold on to these outer objects there's three states of mind

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.720
 that we have like if we go for a pleasant object we want to experience happiness if we go for an

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.760
 unpleasant object to avoid then we have a feeling of suffering and a neutral object that we don't

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.720
 really perceive much then we have a neutral feeling neutral sensation and if we repeatedly

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.680
 kind of go for the pleasant things avoid the unpleasant things then we're reinforcing our

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:09.920
 habits and this is called karma um and so the habit strengthens itself as um it's reinforced

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.720
 again and again it makes it easier to happen in the future and then it just depends on when the

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.640
 right circumstances are available if that habit's going to arise or not surbitures then say that

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.560
 all experiences come from mind but by resting in mind's natural state of balance our awareness

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.880
 naturally becomes clearer and less habituated so meditation stops this wheel of constant habits

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.640
 and that everything we know and experience is created by mind and that all conceptual thinking

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.880
 we have is based on our habits and so the habits in our mind then are reflected outwardly in what

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.000
 we say and what we do with our body and then they go into differentiate at least eight different

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.720
 levels of mind so very quickly these five types of consciousness about eye consciousness ear

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.560
 consciousness nose tongue and body and these are a direct sense impression of what we experience

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.680
 and then after that the sixth consciousness comes in called dualistic consciousness which

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.920
 strings these sensory experiences together and then comments on them makes them into a story

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.680
 and puts them into a sequence um and then beneath this sense of dualistic consciousness is what's

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.440
 called they refer to as the alia so this is this habitual mind or the consciousness store has

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.520
 it's where our habits are stored and so where our habits come from is this alia and then where they

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.440
 are stored in and as we reinforce them is this alia but then they go on to say that when we

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:46.560
 purify this alia or this subtle level of our dualistic mind we purify it of all habits then

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.480
 we have what's called non-grasping awareness or primordial nature so the mind purified of all the

00:25:52.480 --> 00:26:01.520
 habits is called the primordial nature or non-grasping awareness um yeah and so then the difference

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.720
 between uh whether we suffer or not is really whether we recognize our mind when it's not

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.960
 grasping onto its own habits and that's what distinguishes sentient beings from buddhas

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.360
 but regardless of whether we recognize this or not like that um that is the nature of our mind

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.440
 when it's not holding on to habits um and so it becomes very important for us to see how that our

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.880
 mind is when it's not holding on to habits and also to see how it is when it does hold on to habits

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.520
 so then that goes into this second point about this conceptual mind

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.960
 conceptual thinking operates on the basis of habitual patterns the habits that you repeat

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.240
 circle back on you again and again and again whatever habits are learned in this lifetime

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.160
 will be reflected in future lifetimes they are maintained within the mind whatever felt

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.280
 whatever felt comfortable when you were a child formed into habitual patterns that continue now

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.160
 that you're grown the habits you establish in your mind are reflected in your behavior

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.480
 in buddhism this is known as the law of karmic cause and effect

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:23.600
 i did have one question here which was we talk about how the mind has some of the beautiful

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.800
 qualities and we also talk about how your conceptual thinking you know is you know are

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:39.280
 these habits and so you know on the outside on paper it's very easy to to see how we distinguish

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:46.800
 them but then when we sit down you know it's it's all it's all going on so it's like how

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.280
 how do you how do you clarify you know what's actually clarity and wisdom what's what's our

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.840
 habit you know what are the ways that we can start distinguishing these things not so that

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.440
 we start grasping on to clarity and wisdom as much as to to have that recognition

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:18.480
 so they say when the when the mind is balanced it arises in certain ways so they say the nature of

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:26.480
 mind is totally balanced but that balance always moves it arises in certain ways so then what are

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.080
 those ways it arises because if we can look and see if in our mind is it arising in these ways

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.120
 are these qualities of love and compassion this bodhicitta calmness attentiveness appreciation

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.920
 these qualities we've heard about so many times if they're actually arising more and more in our

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:56.640
 experience then that's one way of seeing that oh this is a balanced state of mind and just what

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:04.560
 that's like when we actually can actually calm our body speech and mind to the place where

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:12.560
 we're kind of experiencing that where we're experiencing that balance and that kind of

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.360
 what that's like

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:25.280
 and then maybe when we begin to then start getting distracted from that place or like

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:34.640
 into one thing or like then maybe that's where we start to be able to observe our habits

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.880
 like when we can on whatever level of meditation we're doing if we're just

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.080
 calming the body speech and mind holding the focus i think we can all to some degree have

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:54.400
 an experience of that that like lightness and openness and kind of bright bright quality or

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.080
 i mean there's so many adjectives you could put to it but you know it is peaceful there is a sense

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:10.080
 of vividness and lightness and kind of that's there when we actually can find that balance

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.440
 and that that place and then i think our habits and our concepts are how we

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:24.160
 either relate to that or you know just start trying to figure it out or make it something

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.760
 or just completely forget what we're doing and then we realize oh wait i'm thinking about you

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:37.440
 know something else or honing into one sensory experience i mean that's just like really gross

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:47.120
 level i think sense of being with the the the qualities of mind as far as that the vivid

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:54.640
 brightness wisdom you know forget the words we're using here and then and then our habitual

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.760
 patterns are that just whenever whatever we fall to which again aren't necessarily bad there are

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.720
 positive and negative but you know but just at times will tend to draw us away from being aware

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:15.200
 and so instead of being aware of the circumstances around us we tend to fall into that habitual

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.000
 pattern that drags us away from that which can lead to bad or good tendencies depending on the

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.200
 habitual pattern but it definitely is one of those things that takes you away from being

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.120
 aware of your surroundings and being able to be the most effective in compassion or in other

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.160
 actions whereas if you kind of draw away from their habitual patterns it lets you have a more

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.720
 open mind towards anything that comes into your view i guess even in a simple way of saying it

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.880
 could be this whether you're distracted or not distracted you know just if you're if you're

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.680
 distracted and you're following all your ordinary chains like you're saying of just dualistic

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.280
 grasping onto this following out of that chain grasping into that following that chain of thought

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:05.520
 you know that's distraction and i think we all can realize that that's what it is you know and then

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.760
 oh hopefully there's some moment where we realize oh wow it's just going along with that for a

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.000
 while

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.520
 there you know kind of pull back and kind of reconnect and maintain awareness or you know

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.440
 whatever the practices we're doing but it's you know and that's almost just like a simple way of

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:30.080
 saying it and also that part too of building on we might be become aware of habitual patterns we

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:38.640
 have that are either just a waste of time or just cause more neurosis and trouble for ourselves and

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.640
 others directly indirectly and then there's this whole part of our practice of accumulating merit

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:53.120
 you know so and then actualizing our bodhicitta which in a way is positive positive response

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.120
 and positive habitual habits that are built building on something that again it's there

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:06.400
 we have that love we have joy we have compassion is just making it more and more

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.920
 wide and more and more practical and more and more beneficial and more and more actually

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:20.880
 being that so there is that that part of the habitual pattern that we're working with too

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:29.040
 of not only becoming aware of our negative and once but also the positive too because so

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.600
 creating more beneficial yeah and again and they may be conceptual but still we're on the path

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.280
 so it seems like that's just a good thing to as we talk about things that habits are habits you

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.440
 know

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:51.680
 good but they're not all necessarily bad that's it's just the cleaning I think like

00:33:51.680 --> 00:34:00.320
 on that same note related with habits it's like we all kind of know what a habit what a habit is

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:06.000
 you know it's like the highlights of our life those things we keep telling ourselves over and over

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.480
 again

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.880
 oh this happened to me oh and then it was so good and you think that thought thousands of times

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:17.040
 or hundreds of times or whatever over and over and over and over that habit you know it's a deep

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.240
 strong habit it's like the highlight reel of your life what you emphasize basically what you

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.160
 emphasize to yourself and tell yourself I am this way I am that way I did this I did that

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:34.000
 and you think according to those terms and it's just like reinforcing every time it's reinforcing

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.040
 that tendency to think about it you think about it more you think about it over and over again

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.190
 it oftentimes you know like you were saying that can be that can be positive or that can be

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.600
 negative

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:51.920
 and and what Amanda was saying I think it really that hits the nail on the head grasping yeah how

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.360
 much are you grasping if you want to know whether your habit is good or bad just look at the

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.840
 contraction around it is it something that makes you tense more narrow more more more targeted and

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.600
 like does your mind get more closed or get more open and I think all of us like it's not rocket

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:18.960
 science this it's like I think we all know when we are experiencing that we are open and we are

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:25.680
 relaxed and we are mental you know so that's that's like I mean it's a corny metaphor but like say

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.160
 when you see somebody that you haven't seen for a long time that you really love or that there's a

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.720
 you know like then you have that feeling of just you have a habit of being open and like you know

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.760
 loving towards them and relaxed and you feel your whole you could be in the worst mood but you see

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.480
 that person opens up because you have a certain habit with them or you see someone else or

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:55.040
 something else which really is like a pet peeve and gets you you know you have a habit of closing

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.560
 more targeted you know more closing down so I think particularly a lot of what you're saying

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.400
 here with the concept I think it really brings it in nicely to that last point about how you're

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:10.240
 kind of contrasting the habits have these concepts the primordial nature is beyond these concepts

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.320
 so

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.080
 I don't know if you want to elaborate more on this I think I mean I would say one point first

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.400
 before

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.160
 that third part maybe is it's just totally kind of reiterating what you're saying and also what

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:29.200
 you're saying what we're all saying negative habit positive habit and then mind without habits

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.040
 there's negative grasping positive grasping non grasping there's negative karma positive

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:41.360
 karma mind beyond karma but the whole path is I mean here this is talking more about how our

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 mind is conditioned is grasping is holding and how it is when it's not holding but the path of

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:54.080
 realizing our mind when it's not holding is doing this really positive healthy holding in a way

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.760
 this accumulation of merit doing love and goodness compassion these qualities do we're trying to do

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.680
 we have a sense of self we try to do them but it's positive habit a positive concept more accurate

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.640
 more fully expressive so in the end we're not giving up all these things and realizing that I'm

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:17.200
 no one like all my habits are gone and you know I'm some bland blank no person it's actually we're

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.120
 becoming more flexible more full more fully expressive of our nature and that's another

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:30.320
 way that emptiness it doesn't mean without qualities it means infinitely flexible infinitely

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:39.600
 full of qualities so in that sense that it's good emptiness more flexible

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:48.400
 so then this third and final section of the chapter is specifically related to these concepts

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.480
 and Rinpoche's are saying here in this third section of the chapter that the primordial nature

00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:01.600
 is beyond concepts it's beyond all duality all grasping and that duality mind can be explained

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:08.240
 with concepts but non-conceptual non-dual awareness cannot be explained by concepts

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:15.360
 and all we can do is look at our own mind and directly experience its nature and so then they

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.600
 go on Rinpoche's going to say two stories about this the first being about a more or less a prince

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.040
 who forgot he was a prince and as a result suffered all these kind of usual experiences that we go

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.480
 through and then upon remembering that he was a prince all of a sudden instantly like was totally

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:38.400
 out of the turmoil of usual trying to find food and shelter and instantly had is all the things

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.600
 that come with knowing you're a prince so he recognized that who he was and all of a sudden

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.160
 all these good things were there and then they go on to say that the only difference between

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:54.080
 sentient beings and a buddha is it's that buddhas recognize this nature beyond concepts and

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.480
 sentient

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.000
 beings hold on to their concepts and so we don't recognize that nature but the nature itself is the

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.520
 same for buddhas and non-buddhas or sentient beings and the key way of actually becoming

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.120
 buddhas ourselves is this great joyful effort to continually try to recognize our nature when it's

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.680
 not grasping and then when we stop grasping entirely we become buddhas so then that's the

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.520
 third part of the chapter and then the point here if someone would read bring it all together

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:37.280
 the primordial nature is beyond all concepts is the beginning of the mind and the end of the mind

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.680
 we already have it we do not need anything further the buddha and other great masters taught there

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:43.920
 is

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.680
 nothing to acquire externally it is only a matter of working to reveal what we already have

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.520
 describing the true nature in words is like looking through a window and seeing the sky as

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.440
 square the actual nature of the mind cannot be expressed since it is completely beyond concepts

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.360
 all we can do is look at our own at your own mind and experience its primordial nature

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.680
 when you are able to maintain that state you reach enlightenment

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:20.560
 i have a quick report on this which really helped me as far as meditation

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.520
 one time a meditator friend he said the most natural thing you can do in the whole world is

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:35.280
 just sit there and relax sit still recognize that and just relax so in other words like

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.960
 this is on this point like beyond all concepts so we're not twisting something not trying to

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.200
 make something anything that it's not not trying to make what is something that it's not oh i wish

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.000
 it was this way or i wish it was that way or this and that you know changing and manipulating

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.160
 things

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:58.720
 so it's like basically not manipulating not trying to manipulate the circumstances so that it of

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:04.400
 course with what way you want it to go and change it from the way you don't want it to go so anyway

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:10.000
 i just and remember today here there's nothing to do just just to sit and relax but that was

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.320
 helpful

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:16.720
 for me because it just it's like this is not something strange and unusual meditating and the

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.320
 buddhist path and it's just it's the most natural thing in the whole world actually because you're

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:30.000
 not trying to force things to be some way that they're not you're just relaxing expect as soon

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.440
 as you start to do meditation that instantly you will have some thing that you've seen before

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.640
 read before this is what happens when i meditate it's like no you have to release those concepts

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.800
 and completely free the mind of that type of thing before you can really understand what it's about

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:56.160
 i had a brief question um you know we then we've talked about this a little bit there's that

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.440
 positive grasping where we we of course we want to accumulate merit and we want to accumulate

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.680
 wisdom but at the same time we're recognizing that it's it's not for those accumulations themselves

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.120
 you know as much as recognizing the nature which has more which has that empty quality

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.400
 and as you just described it that more neutral quality and maybe i i guess one of the the

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.280
 questions i had particularly for for people who are a little newer to this how is it that you're

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:30.320
 able to simultaneously understand how it is to engage in positive grasping while still having

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:37.440
 that more open flexible kind of quality understanding in your meditation

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:48.800
 i think in one way it comes to motivation why am i sitting and meditating why am i trying to

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.600
 develop these good qualities at one level of the buddhist teaching it is because we have suffering

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.760
 and we want to be out of that suffering but a little more open little more flexible little more

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.840
 kind of breezy approaches we're doing this for everybody we all have this trouble we all have

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:11.200
 this suffering and not just about me and my problem but all these beings everyone and to really

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.360
 kind

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:17.280
 of engage in a little more open way like a motivation that's a little bigger than just

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.200
 always looking only at our own situation then i think this actually really brings that openness

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:29.840
 it can help really bring more of that openness with these good qualities too not just my love

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.280
 my good experiences but for everybody i like to genuinely try to more and more genuinely feel that

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:45.840
 and i think it touches on earlier what was saying the inseparability of appearances and

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:53.680
 openness or the nature that there's that quality we're looking at distinctions

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.680
 as part of the process but the buddha never said they were separate

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.640
 that and i think that's something to do we're we're always trying to mingle our meditation

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:14.720
 and our practice with our activities we're not like dropping dropping everything as soon as we

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:22.480
 stand up you know we're trying to we're touching home with our formal practice and kind of finding

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.120
 home base like when pache says a lot and then we're moving from there remembering our bodhicitta

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:36.480
 remembering wherever we're whatever we find in our meditation and i thought too just one point with

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.920
 just that word meditation that i found helpful too is that in tibetan how meditation one meaning it

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.440
 means to become familiar so like familiarizing ourselves with the primordial nature with that

00:44:51.440 --> 00:45:00.480
 openness qualities familiar with how ceaselessly and unimpededly everything's arising and how

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:08.080
 vivid things are and as well as just becoming more familiar with like just how precious our

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:15.280
 situation is and impermanence and karma and i mean all those levels of familiarity of study

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:22.080
 contemplation meditation i mean ultimately the buddhist teachings are all about that

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:31.360
 becoming more and more familiar with the nature as it is and seeing what what kind of

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.480
 occludes that and obscures that and what reveals that more and so that part of our practice too

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:48.080
 with bodhicitta and actualizing generating you know accumulating our merit and doing you know

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:55.040
 the paramitas you know generosity you know morality patience you know all apply the joyful

00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:03.360
 effort and then those are qualities of we're touching we're engendering more and we're touching

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:11.280
 home more and we're focusing more on connecting with these qualities of of like that nature

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.440
 that's arising and shining you know that those those aren't those are more more natural than

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:28.400
 unnatural what's unnatural is the grasping so to speak or what but just closest we're getting close

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.720
 to the end of our time we are going to meditate shortly and dedicate we need to sum any of that out

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.400
 i can't wrap it up

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:46.960
 you know i would just and we'll just like what you said like they say in this chapter the whole the

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:55.200
 whole shebang of samsara and nirvana comes from one's own nature so we're we're like dreamers

00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:02.800
 who are asleep who have either samsara dream or nirvana dream so we have the power because the

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:09.680
 nature means it is like what is real the nature is the actual real thing and like they say so many

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:16.480
 times in here i just thought to just just highlight temporary observations temporary

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:23.440
 nightmares temporary grasping temporary that means comes and goes it's not intrinsic feature

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:32.400
 primordial nature that's the title of the chapter never comes and goes always was always there

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.320
 always will be there always was there is there right now so anyway if the whole thing is a dream

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:45.200
 of samsara and nirvana and the whole shebang comes from life itself then all this accumulating

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.680
 positive and meditation and everything is just to wake up it's such a good metaphor

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.680
 wake up and realize we're dreaming you're like oh it is the nature you can never escape it hahaha

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:03.840
 you know like i'm enlightened now now let's share it with everybody you know because we're asleep

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.160
 you know until you wake up so anyway i just that reminded me of how the whole thing is in the

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:17.840
 context of that the whole buddhist path that's why enlightenment is called awake waking up from the

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:25.920
 dream that's samsara and nirvana are something real and solid outside of the primordial nature of

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:50.000
 life

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:07.680
 oh

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:37.680
 oh

00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:07.680
 ah

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:21.360
 may the soul source of benefit and happiness

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.520
 and may the victory banner of the lives of the noble ones the holders of the teachings remain firm

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:35.280
 may all sentient beings always be joyful may all grace into the lower ground cease forever

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.840
 may the wishes of all the buddhist alphas and all the boomies swiftly reach fruition

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:45.120
 at this very moment for the peoples and nations of the earth may not even the names disease famine

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.960
 war and suffering be heard but rather in pure conduct merit wealth and prosperity increase

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.800
 and may supreme good fortune and well-being always aras the precious bodhicitta and those

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.560
 without it may be generated and those who have it may never diminish but always continue increasing

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:09.120
 may the great tradition of kenpo shantra shitta lopan patma sambhava and arma king tritsa and

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.480
 detsan increase and spread throughout the three realm world may the appearance of the three jewels

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.440
 and the mind streams of beings remain inseparable and brings sublime well-being throughout the

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:19.680
