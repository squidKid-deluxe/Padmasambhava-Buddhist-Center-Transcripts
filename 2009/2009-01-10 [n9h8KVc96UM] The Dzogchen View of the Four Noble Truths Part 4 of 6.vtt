00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.760
 Now the fourth truth, when you follow the fourth truth, then what we revert or what is the fourth

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.720
 truth, again, Buddha said, fourth truth, cessation truth. Cessation truth, that means what is

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.080
 ceased,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:36.480
 is all the unnatural things are now stopped. Ceased, unnatural things, all negative emotions,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.840
 ego clinging, suffering, all that is stopped because they are not natural and now you just

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:55.280
 follow the natural, now unnatural things are stopped. This cessation truth is then in Sanskrit

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:14.640
 known as nirvana. And that is the final result. And there is nirvana, the truth or the cessation

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:25.120
 truth comes from the following path, path of the true nature. And by that we discover the

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:35.200
 whole panoramic nature, the wholesome that nature without it diluted where the natures are. And

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.600
 that

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.800
 is known as then nirvana, the blasphemous nature or freedom free from all the suffering, the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:54.960
 chaos, the confusion status where the nature we discover. And then other terminology

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.520
 in the Mahayana known as Buddhahood or Buddhahood of the dharmakaya, sambhokaya, narmakaya,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.440
 all those names the terminology use.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.400
 And they are then connected this truth and the path is connected to the achievement or

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:40.320
 the result or the cessation truth. The cessation truth is like result and the path is cause and

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:57.680
 they are cause and effect.
