00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
 As you all know, this morning I'm going to offer the involvement of the Khandro Thugtik,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.240
 which is the involvement of the wisdom dakini Shintojas. Before I begin the ceremony,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 and I'm going to give the introduction, which is also part of the ceremony,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 according to the lineage instruction, there is always like an introduction, part of what

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.120
 means empowerment and what is the wisdom dakini Shintojas. And where this teaching comes from,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.080
 all those are discussing as introduction, so that we can settle our mind and so we can

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.240
 actualize these blessings and empowerment. In order to begin this, of course, always

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.760
 important, always in the teaching said, as you all know, the motivation is so important,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.000
 the intention is so important. This time, in terms of we have so many intentions,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 such as all teachings by Brother Shaktamani, I'm going to summarize those all teachings into three

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 intentions, negative intentions, positive intentions, and neutral intentions. Among all

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.640
 those three intentions, this time we're going to, igniting and increasing are the beautiful virtues

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.720
,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.200
 positive intentions. What is positive intention is this time, joy and appreciation and devotion.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.840
 Let release all the doubt and hesitation, analytic and intellectual ideas. This time is not. We're

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 going to merging and engaging and deepening ourself to this ceremony, to this part of the practices

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.200
,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.840
 without interference and obstacles of the dualities, as I said, doubt and hesitation,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.240
 skeptical, this and that, although these things we should put on the site. What do we need to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:23.440
 bring up? As I said already, joy, devotion, love and kindness are compared to all sentient beings,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.880
 and joy, the first joy. Joy is so important because we have every reason to be joy.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 As the Buddha said, I'm sure you heard so many of these things from the great teachers,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.160
 not just here. We should observe that. We should stand on that. It's true. It's not just verbally

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520
 kind of talking, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is not really that blah, blah, blah. It's true.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.800
 We should, it says it's true, we should reflect this. Forever more joy. We have the 18 endowment

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.960
 callers, first ever. We have 18 endowment callers, not just the human beings. We have

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.000
 that 18 preachers, rich in the scholars that we have. Truly we have that. Therefore, we should

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 have a joy. The second joy, this time, we are connected to this great teacher, the Western

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.240
 Dakini Chinsodya and Gopin Masambhava. It's not just for accidental. We came here, gathered these

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.200
 inductings, but truly we connected. That means because of this connection, we are going to reveal

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.080
 our Buddha nature, our goodness quality. That will be good for now, good for the future, good for

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.400
 all

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.880
 the time, not just only ourself, but we are going to make goodness to every living beings. We have

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.280
 beautiful vision, goal, as a believed sunlight, the shining that in our heart, going to bright

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.760
 every, our path, in every direction, not just only all the living beings, wherever we contact,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.160
 and then as well as everyone's. This is what we began. This is the journey we began. This is the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.080
 step we are taking. Therefore, we should make great joy, bring joy and appreciate. How wonderful,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 how beautiful, how this important. I'm going to make this something spiritual, meaningful that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.840
 will reflect to myself, reflect to the others, truly in the heart and mind. That is joy. And

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.080
 then devotion. This is again, precious teaching. It's not just again, we can't do like experimental

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.480
 things, but truly it is lineage teaching, precious teaching. It is inspired. It brought the full

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 benefit of the result. So many enlightened beings, so many great practitioners, one after another.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.720
 Not

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.200
 just it happened once in a while, but truly it happened. Today, we engage into this path,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.960
 that, that technique. We are holding that. We have a path, follow with that path. Therefore,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.960
 pure stone devotion. This is not just a teaching can truly just happen. It is a continued path

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.400
 teaching, lineage teaching. Therefore, all of those great master, great practice who preserve

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.680
 this teaching as they're breathing, they're high with full of joy, full of love and full of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.400
 compassion,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.080
 full of precious and inspired enlightened beings. That means bring up the joy, peace, happiness,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.360
 and both joy and peace, happiness to every living beings. How wonderful, how beautiful,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.640
 how precious it is, how special it is. Today, I'm going to connect to this. How wonderful,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:30.640
 pure stone, pure stone, rich in the scholars. That is what we need. With this, then, now we go. And

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.880
 then also same time, think of this all compassion. Compassion is the essential teaching of the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.400
 Buddha chapter. No matter where it is, whether it is a Hinayana teaching, whether it is a Mahayana

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.160
 teaching, whether it is a Vayayana teaching, compassion is so important. Feel great compassion,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.840
 love, kindness, thought for all the living beings. We're not going to exclude anyone by our ego

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.920
 clinging and our grasping thought as a mundane worldly cue we do. Today, we're going to bring

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:08.080
 everyone and we, everyone who benefited by this sincerely feel from that path, from our mind,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.640
 from our bone, from our breathing. Really feel that truly to everyone that we like to bring the joy

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.640
,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.920
 peace, happiness, remove all their difficulty, troubles, suffering, whatever they're going

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.200
 through, whatever they're experiencing, whether they're in this earth or whether they're beyond

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 the galaxy. We are going to bring that to everyone to bring the joy and peace happiness. The same

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 desire that we have, we like to be even better for them. That is known as the great teaching Buddha

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.240
 Chakra Kamanath, in this teaching Buddha Chakra Kamanath's teaching, Bodhicata, as you all know,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:50.880
 that we should feel so sincerely, strongly, then truly we are standing beautifully on our principle

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.680
 of the Buddha nature. From there we begin this ceremony, that is foundation, that is ground,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.640
 that is the way we're standing, tall and strong and firm. From there we're going to

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.560
 capture our beauty, our knowledge and our blessings that we're going to receive or the blessings

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.040
 that

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.360
 continue to pass. So with that, I understand the beautiful foundations. Now we talk about

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.400
 where this teaching comes from. This is, again of course you all know, but this is what the

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.840
 lineage teaching says, because it's not just our own life, we develop things as experiment,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.800
 things are claiming something, but it's long-lasting lineage teaching as natural.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.640
 Continuing from Buddha Chakra Muni 2600 years ago, continuing until now, everyone who connected to

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.720
 this teaching with love and joy and reward, courage and commitment, they prefer their goals.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.840
 This is not just a story, it's true. So many beings, one after another, truly they become

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:01.200
 the true love, true compassion, true wisdom, true peace, harmony, respect and appreciate,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.120
 not clash with ego, claiming that I'm more important than you, this and that. That ego

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.120
 train is completely gone and brings a genuine scholar of love and kindness, respect and

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.120
 appreciate with that. So many people who have practiced and reached the highest realization

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.120
 as Buddha Chakra Muni himself, that is, that's the teaching today we connect again. We're already

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.320
 connected, it's not something that we are not. We are connected, today we're deepening,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.920
 we're instantiating, we're glorifying that beautiful qualities, that beautiful teachings,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.160
 that reflect beautiful example, that outside and that beautiful example, and inherently we have

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.680
 put one joint together, we are going to glorify our beautiful natures, that is right. So therefore,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.920
 this teaching comes from Buddha Chakra Muni. Buddha Chakra Muni reached enlightenment at 35,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:04.800
 approaching it as enlightenment at 35, and he turned the veil of dharma, that benefited

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:12.080
 all the sentient beings, as you all know. From at 35, a few days ago, according to very history,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.360
 the Buddha gave the false teaching, false, noble, truth teaching. The truth teaching,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.480
 not false teaching, false or the subject teaching, it is truth, therefore it's called truth. It's

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.160
 noble because it's truth. Truth is noble, there's nothing higher noble, nobility than the truth.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.960
 That's what the Buddha gave these teachings, poor, noble, truth teachings. From that on,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.520
 until at 81 or at 80, Buddha continually gave the teachings, all the different

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:56.400
 categories and the different levels of the teaching, those teachings are divided, as you all know,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:06.480
 know as the Vinaya teaching, Sukhara teaching, Abhidhamma teaching, all and Vadiyana teachings.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.760
 Those are just roughly divisions that summarize entirely his teachings. What are these old

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.760
 teachings? His teachings are teachings of wisdom and compassion, all that teaching. No matter

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.400
 it is teaching on the Vinaya, it is the compassion and the wisdom teachings. United target, never

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.880
 separated. Every Sukhara teaching, that is what it is, teachings on the wisdom and compassion.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.000
 Every Abhidhamma is the teachings on the wisdom and compassion. Every Vadiyana teaching is the

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.080
 teachings on the wisdom and compassion. Where is this wisdom and compassion? The teaching tells

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.560
 that

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.640
 but actually Buddha points inward to our heart, to every nature of ours. Our love, our compassion,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.880
 our wisdom, how we should ignite, how we should glorify, not let it trap in the duality and

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.600
 the fabrication of the grass tree and the habit of greatness. That's what the Buddha told,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.440
 continually all those teachings, what the teachings is. Among all those teachings,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.520
 today's teaching is connected very much to the Vadiyana teaching. It is teaching of the Mahayana

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.280
 Vadiyana teachings. In the Vadiyana teaching, within there is many also two categories, but

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.120
 first they divided subgroup as two. The outer Tantra, inner Tantras. This city belongs with inner

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.440
 Tantras. Within the inner Tantra, there is different terminology used in some new schools

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.680
 of Tibetan Buddhism used mostly as like father Tantra, mother Tantra, and neutral Tantras.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.880
 In any of my schools of Tibetan Buddhism, used as ancient school or the mother schools,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:56.320
 all the Tibetan Buddhism used terminologies as Mahayoga, Anoyoga, and Adiyoga teachings.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.400
 Among that three teachings, this particular teaching is more connected to the Anoyoga teachings

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.600
 or the mother Tantras. We will talk it with the essence of the Mahayoga and essence of the

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.520
 Adiyoga teachings, combine together that teaching. This is the mother Tantra teachings. This great

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.360
 teaching came to Tibet, as you all know, in the 8th century. The full teaching of the

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.480
 entire Buddha teaching without any partialities. Whole entire teaching came to Tibet,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.200
 Tibetan in the century, by gracious kindness, compassion, and aspiration of the Kintras on

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 that thing. Great Master Chanda Rachita, and then 2nd Buddha and Gaurabhema. Three of them

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:53.040
 bought the entire teaching to Tibet without any kind of partialities or without anything living

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.600
 behind. Tibet has become the richest Buddhist country on this earth, according to history,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.480
 according we can read the monument, legacy, teachings, still existent, that. And among

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:14.480
 that with those teachings, and then as continuing this teaching, spread it and benefit so many

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.680
 things from the 8th century until now. But among that, then schools, there's many different

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.200
 schools that developed in Tibetan Buddhism. And all of Buddhism, all of Adiyana teaching,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 all are great teachings. Great teachings, among that, then this teaching belongs with

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.000
 Myanmar schools of Tibetan Buddhism, which you all know, the mother schools of the Tibetan

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.560
 Buddhism, where, from where, every Buddhist school is developed. Spread it out as like,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.000
 as branch and leaves and fruit and flower as that developed, beautifully developed. Among that,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.240
 this is the Myanmar school of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Myanmar school of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.520
 continue the teaching through two different channels, two different lineage, two different

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.680
 methods. Those are known as the Kama and the Therma, as you all, or many of you already know.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.600
 Kama means order, long, last, living. That's something continued as the normal ways. Look at

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.760
 the way teachers give the teaching to the students, their practices, and then they actualize their

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.600
 realization of their teaching and share it to the other, continuing one after another. That is Kama

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.640
 in Tibetan, which means, I translate it roughly, the order, transmission, long, last, limited.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:40.320
 It continued from age to century, until now, as unbroken, long, last, flowing as like rivers,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:47.360
 like river gates or river messages. Continually, follow that. And then, there is a second lineage

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:54.000
 teaching, which is known as Therma teaching, which is a special hallmark, a special legacy

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.880
 of the Merupian Masambha. Therma is very special, something that extraordinary beneficial activity

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:08.240
 that can be expanded and reflected from the beneficial activity of the Merupian Masambha,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:15.780
 known as Therma, hidden and rediscovered. Something magical, something mystery, something beautiful

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:15.920
,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.440
 something amazing, teachings. That contains also the essence of the Veriana teaching,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.150
 essence of the old, the entire Buddha teaching. It's nothing without the range of the Buddha

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.720
 teaching.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.480
 Within the Buddha teaching, it is what? Because the Buddha teaching is true, it's natural, it's

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.040
 simple,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.640
 it's honest, it's love, it's complete. There's nothing new to go. Gurbel Masambha, therefore,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:45.760
 he is one of the great lineage holder and masters of Buddhism, entire Buddhism. Within that state,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.160
 but he used this skill to expand to the long-lasting of the teachings, known as Therma teaching,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.360
 as many of you know it. There's many great thetans came, one after another, from the

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.040
 ninth centuries until now. So many, hopefully, toward the end of the ninth centuries or the

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.560
 beginning of the tenth century, so many great thetans came, great individually, enlightened beings,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.640
 showed up as in the teachings, as like blooming up from the metals, the mushrooms blooming up from

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:16.720
 the

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.800
 metals. So many great masters came one after another, those difference. They bought all those

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.480
 legends and teachings of the Gurbel Masambha and this great Western Dakinis. They are teachings,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.640
 they both out and share. What are those teachings? The analytic teachings are mainly connected with

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:41.440
 with the hiri and the tantra. Mahayoga, Anayoga, Anand, Athayoga, teachings or combinations or

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.800
 representing all of those hiri and the tantra, each of those things. But basically, all those

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.440
 teachings came, one after another, continue, continue these teachings. And this among the

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:02.320
 many teachings, many of those great thetans, and then later on, those great such masters, such as

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:08.800
 two brothers of the Mendolian schools, and as was the Muntimpa, Rongzompa, and the great master,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:18.000
 they merged, and it was great, great, great, they merged with the kama and the theta as two big

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.040
 rivers, one still, clean, beautiful, authentic river of lineage. They inspired and benefited

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:34.080
 so many beings, merged, they're not really too separated, merged together. And so among those

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.680
 all the teachings, this particular teaching, it belongs with great theta, emanation of the

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:47.280
 Ravi Chachamalata, or emanation of the body of his Holiness, discovered by the great theta,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:54.160
 his Holiness, the Durum of modern time, we call his Holiness, because we've been traveling like

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.360
 in the Western country, and our Prince said his Holiness, the new Devarachidodhi, or another one

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.600
 in the world we call the Chagya Durumvatyas, the supreme lord of the protacto, protacto,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:18.400
 protacto of all beings, the his, the new Devarachidodhis. He was a great theta,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:26.240
 great master's, great teacher, great fortress, great, great writer, and great thinker,

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.680
 yet he's so simple, so ordinary, so humble, just as we are like, like just simple persons. This

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:40.720
 great master discovered so many great teachings, one after another. And others, among all those

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.800
 teachings, this is the one of his supreme theta, teaching, supreme teachings, known as essence of

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:56.000
 the Nakini drugs, heart drugs. In the teachings, he said his Holidodhyarumvatyas, body is emanation

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.040
 of the Ravi Chachamalata, his speech is emanation of the Western Nakini in Georgia, and his Western

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.960
 mind is emanation of the Guru of Amma Sambha. Three individually enlightened beings come

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:17.920
 triggered as one simple beautiful beings, humble beings, who was born in southern Tibet over 200

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.840
 years ago. And this great teacher then, as he said, brought so many of these teachings,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.840
 so many teachings. He became the true lineage holder of the entirely human schools of Tibetan

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.240
 Buddhism. He became the master's of all the nimah practitioners, particularly who came out of the

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:46.640
 Tibet in the sense in the 1959s and heard the communist pressures and their powers who came out.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:55.120
 They become his teachers, their teachers. This is known as his holiness, the new Jyograchi doctors.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.040
 He gave so many of these teachings again, again, so many connected students and so many beings

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:08.400
 around the world. And among that, I was one of those students who also received these teachings.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.800
 And as I received this teaching, I'm sharing it to you, to you that. And then I received also this

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:22.000
 teaching involvement from my beloved teacher, Kati Parthishara, many times, again and again,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.920
 again. So all those great teachers gave me this teaching. As I received, I preserved with joy

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:37.760
 and devotion and devotion and bodhicata with humbleness with as much as can be given. And with

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:45.120
 that attitude, with that thought, with that nature, I'm offering you this empowerment. So this is a

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:53.120
 brief history of the lineage. Now, we'll talk a little bit about who is Vasryam Rakhineeshim

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.200
 Soja, as you all know, but again, it's a part of the lineage. Yachim Soja can understand in many

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:07.440
 different ways. Absolute level, we Yachim Soja can be understand and the relative level Yachim Soja

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.400
 can be understand. Absolute level, Yachim Soja.
