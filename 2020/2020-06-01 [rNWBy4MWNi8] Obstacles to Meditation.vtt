00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.040
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, we stand in our motivation, the attention. Of course we are

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.080
 going to be collecting our mind to the Dharma.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.190
 Therefore, we are always, the teaching says, it's so important to start with your motivation and be

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.880
 in that motivation state.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.200
 After we've concluded the sessions, and then also then you get married with that good intention or

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.840
 good, beautiful motivation,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.640
 then everything is completely lined up, exactly what we like to be, or what we like to see resolved

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.040
, it really will come according to the teaching.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.880
 So therefore, compared to all those things, situations and circumstances, it's our kind of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.600
 responsibility in the way that we want to practice.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.960
 We like to get some good result, we like to benefit ourselves and other beings, and so for that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 reason, this motivation is what is so important to any situations or any Dharma practices.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.080
 If we can keep this motivation all the time, then really good practitioners, good practitioners,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.920
 that means during meditation and also during boss meditation,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 in a way, 24 hours, we can kind of turn in or to put on that on switch, that then really we are

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.950
 excellent practitioners, and truly we will see the result, good benefit, good claims, our behaviors

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.120
,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.290
 behaviors of the activity of the body, behaviors of our speech, and then mind, really it will do

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.760
 that. So therefore, again, his strength and the motivation, this beautiful motivation,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.850
 and that motivation, as I've always mentioned so many times, there are three motivations that I'm

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.480
 highlighting there, and that is, first, it's joy and appreciation.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.230
 That is, joy and appreciation is all our situations and circumstances, what we are, who, what we

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 are, and what we are, and that is first.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.200
 And then the combined with that joy and appreciation, then bodhijata, vastness, motivation of the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.240
 bodhijata for all living beings, because we are practicing of the Mahayana,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.950
 and of course, we are practicing of the Buddha teaching, generally Buddha, particularly the Mahay

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.890
ana, and also Tantra Mahayana. So therefore, again, bodhijata is essence and foundation in the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 central column of these practices.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:07.220
 And along with that, and then beauty, realization. As the Mahayana teaching always stated, every

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.740
 day is enlightenment status. So kind of bring that also realization or say something, at least open

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.650
 our attitude toward that, I'd like to explore that beautiful enlightenment, call it that, call it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.120
 that.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.100
 Having those taught, ah, like with motivation. With that motivation, then we are going to go to the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.150
 teaching itself, and teaching we are continually following as teaching by the Japji, the New Ramaji

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.000
 teachings.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 Had heart advice to the 14th ones. That is what we are following there. There. And this again, we

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.770
 went, and that means myself, I went through that, kind of a little bit elaborated, and then we're

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.000
 talking about the actualizing bodhijata practices.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.050
 There's also like in the Japji and the New Ramaji teachings, heart advice to the 14th ones, also

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.690
 mentioned bodhijata, how important it is. It's one of the treasures of the practitioners, keeping

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.000
 bodhijata in the heart and mind. So we are going again in bodhijata.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.100
 Bodhijata is reaching bodhijata and actualizing bodhijata. But reaching bodhijata is in our heart

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.650
 and mind, that we again, we can keep that all the time, as much as we really can, all the time

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.000
 actually.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.010
 That is really the excellent practices. Totally virtuous. It's dharma. It's so, so spiritual.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.000
 Because bodhijata is thinking of all living beings.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.320
 It has no condensations or contentment of the, what's called the, it has no stains. No stains of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 the self-important. It is totally pure of love and kindness and compassion, compassion for all

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 living beings.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.460
 That is so, so real, so spiritual. That we can bodhijata when we were actualizing that, according

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.000
 our capabilities and readiness, then those are known as six paramata practices.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.880
 And then there we went, six paramata. We actualized in bodhijata, six paramata, one after another,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.420
 those six paramata. Among the six paramata, we went, the four paramata already, and we are going

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.000
 now, fifth paramata.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.740
 And the fifth paramata is the concentration of dhyam-paramata. Dhyam-paramata, concentration of dhy

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.600
am-paramata or some dhyam-paradha-champa, inescapable, some dhyam-paradha-champa, that we are going

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.000
 now on that.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.830
 And in order to do that, also we discussed how important of this concentration, meditation, or this

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.000
 paramata, the fifth paramata.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Because it is dealing steadily to the mind. And therefore, it is so, so important.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.400
 All our realizations and performance are really dependent upon how the stabilization, how our

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.000
 stabilization of the mind is.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 When our mind is more stabilized, more calm, more stable, realization comes. The fulfillment comes.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And all the beauty of the nature is really arising, arising from the deep opportunity of the mind.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.400
 And therefore, we don't have the stabilization of our mind. Its complete mind is below the way and

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.000
 completely mixed up the turbulence of the conceptions on the surface.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.850
 Even though the beauty and the quality are within the nature of the mind, but yet it cannot come

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.000
 out so easily.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.260
 Because of the turbulence of the conceptions, turbulence with thoughts that completely blow up in

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.000
 all the turbulence.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.030
 Those turbulence, what are those? Like anxieties, worries, and the skeptical, doubt, and hes

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.000
itations related with all the negative emotions.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.080
 Those are raging back and forth, different ways. Load up, straight up, completely turbulence of the

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.000
 space of our own peaceful mind, mental states.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.040
 That is turbulence. And because of that, we won't shine up. He didn't call it the mind. Mind for

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.000
 that reason.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 This concentration or this meditation, the end part of the matter, is the most important.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.020
 From there, every realization, every achievement, all the Buddha teaching comes with these

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.000
 concentrations.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.360
 So for that reason, we discussed, I might win those, call it benefit and important, those I already

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.000
 win, and of course you all know.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.810
 There are more details of this, how the mind is so important, how the mind is controlling

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.000
 everything.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.710
 So many teachings, all the Buddha teachings, and particularly those practices, leanings,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:36.000
 instructions, teachings, really so clearly explain more targeted,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.520
 more practical, more elaborated, and kind of almost stated everywhere, you don't know how to kind

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.000
 of bring, don't, more kind of like on the center, center light.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.320
 So all that, that's called big and stoking. So coming with more kind of target in that way, really

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.000
 there's so many beautiful things.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 I'm sure you read that, but I'm just, how important it is.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.830
 And then, in order to have the mind to more kind of bring, to accelerate, more calm and peaceful

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.000
 way, how we do.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And that is then, we read what any teaching says, always have to have isolated, isolated.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:26.150
 In a debate, in a chate, vinbha, vinbha, vinbha, vinbha means isolation, or even I translate some

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.000
 words, hermitage, hermit, hermit, isolations.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 All kind of like more calm and peaceful ways, isolated, how we start.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.910
 That isolation has two, that is called isolation of the physical activities, isolation of the

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.000
 mental activities, mental body activities.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:06.160
 This is too important for our to bring good meditation or good practice. Good practice, what I mean

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.840
 there, I'm talking, practice such as visualization, meditation with visualization, meditation with

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.000
 DD, meditations.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Or this repetition of mantras, those are the main practices, all these practices.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Today, we have to have good circumstances, and that circumstance is isolation.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 And isolation of the, or hermitage of our body, hermitage of our mind.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.970
 If that suits the world with you, you can use that hermitage, otherwise, isolations. Or otherwise,

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:45.000
 vinbha, vinbha, in a debate, all vinbha, lu vinbha, and si vinbha.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Two vinbha, two vinbha.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.410
 What is that really teaching said, when he is talking, how it said, lu nanda le vinbha, si nanto le

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.000
 vinbha.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:10.300
 That's it. So, our two vinbhas, mind is isolated from all the conceptions, and body is isolated

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.000
 from all the mundane activities.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.880
 That is the one true isolation. Therefore, to have that isolation, of the particular, related with

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:28.000
 physical, physical exhalation, then go into the hermitage.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Hermitage, I mentioned, as teaching is for.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.960
 That hermitage is that call it, call it of the hermitage is clearly explained in the suttara alank

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.000
ara, on dho de ji, in the teaching, dho de ji, by bacteria, bacteria or the asaenga.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Asaenga, there is five points of when we are studying.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Then, and of course, you all know that.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 That exhalation is one, mainly explaining about the exhalation of the body.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Body exhalations.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.500
 What a great master Kamala Shala said in his goal, the graduation technique of the middle, middle

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:17.000
 book, first book, middle book, and third book, I mentioned, and many of you know that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.720
 The three books, among that middle book, said that residing in the favorable places, that is one of

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:35.000
 the cause of becoming successful meditation practices, favorable places.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.610
 That favorable places is the great master, I said, Madhira, explained that hermitage, five hermit

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:50.000
ages, those five qualities, are with one, up another.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 I'm not going to repeat those again.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 That we went yesterday, and you all know that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 So that is the hermitage.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.860
 After that, why did you do that? Because of trying to be distended from the isolation of the bursi,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:12.000
 mundane, regular, routine, habitual activities.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 In order to that, you went to that hermitage.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.430
 And that is happening where you're in the city, for example, again as a serious hermitage. In the

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:32.000
 teaching, he said, if favorable, meet you that way, then you can sit on the city too.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.960
 If you prefer, if it's more appealing, more peaceful, more nice, then you can do your practice

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.000
 quite successfully and beautifully.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Then even the city is fine, otherwise, it's hermitage.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 And hermitage, in the teaching, he said, what is hermitage, actually?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 In the teaching, he said, it's about five miles, five miles from the city.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 The city is considered as hermitage.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.490
 Actually, in the teaching, he said, the jangrajaks. So it's about five, maybe five miles, that is,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.000
 perhaps, in hermitage.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 That is ancient style. And of course, that means outskirts of the cities.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.040
 That is, if that meets with the qualification explained in the teachings of the materials, in the

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:36.170
 Shukra Alikara, or explained by the great master Kamashilas, people were placed, then that is her

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.000
mitage.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.680
 If that shifts. But even if five miles away of the city, if there's more business, more, they don't

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.000
 meet hermitage.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.780
 So it's also kind of a polo with your own inner westerns, inner westerns, and practical, because we

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.000
 like to be practical.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.050
 The Greek teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, is very practical. Always in the teaching, he said, not too

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:15.000
 extreme. Extreme, kind of extreme, practice extreme, real extreme, is not natural.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 It's not natural. We're swinging too much back and forth. That's a duality. That's a publicity.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 One great teacher with full common sense, practical, more drawn to the earth.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Way things are, who explained clearly as it is, that's what really he mentioned. No extremes.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Whether it's control, whether it's meditation, whether it's will, in the middle, that is middle.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.660
 Middle. Middle is also not just a kind of middle between, to swipe and leap. It's union. Together,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.000
 union. Everything is in union status.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.120
 To truth is a union. To accumulation, merit is a union. To resolve the chaos or the achievement is

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:22.000
 union. There's no separation. The other thing is, that's what the great master, great teacher,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 explained that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.640
 So, therefore, that is the favorable places. That is, again, what I'm trying to highlight, that is

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.000
 isolation of the physical from the activity of the mindings.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.090
 Then, the most important, once you've got that, which you have the isolation of the physical from

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:51.720
 the mundane activity of the worldly chores, then isolation of the mind from the conception. That is

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.000
 the most important.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.100
 That you need anywhere. We need that when you meditate in practices. Whether you're sitting in city

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:09.180
, whether you're sitting in a hermitage in holy caves, sacred caves and mountains, we have to have

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:18.000
 been, have to have, isolated our mind from the conceptions, all the mundane thoughts.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:37.490
 For that reason, great master Kamala Khyala explained, all those yesterday, we were six causes.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.520
 Those, the most of these five, five are more highlighted, more targeted to have the isolation of

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.000
 the mundane conceptions.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.290
 Too many Bozines thought. That is really the, mainly it is. Of course, it is also the isolation of

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.000
 the body, too, along with that.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 So, that is the isolation of the mind from the conception.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.720
 If it's not that the mind is isolated from the conception, if a Bozine is the same as in the cities

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:08.870
, city or in a distant calm, difficult times, then we're really not going to get big benefit or

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.000
 progress.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.160
 Therefore, we have to be isolated from mundane, concerning worldly activities, such as the desires,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.000
 greedies and all those things.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.070
 So, that we went yesterday, one after another, quite thoroughly, as great master Kamala Khyala

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.000
 explained, and I thought, highlight each of those.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.980
 That is where, then it will bring the isolation of the Bozines, of the mind from all the

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.000
 conceptions, conceptions.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 With the isolation of the mind from the conception, what will the mind be going to think?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.680
 Now we're going to think more, all those beautiful that, our beautiful quality of mind, loving

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.000
 kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, poor boneless thoughts.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.430
 We went those one after another, I mean, you know. All that is not something that I'm told, I said,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.000
 and you only know that time.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.110
 That the first time, I'm not really saying that. We've all heard so many times, poor boneless

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:18.000
 thoughts, increasing those, all those dungli practices, increasing those.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Those are mental activities. They are mentally, mentally analyzed, mentally performing.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:35.010
 It is a mind for activities. When you think and reflect our mind with those beautiful thoughts,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:42.000
 thought, you are not, we are not in that kind of regular, our mood of the, the suffrage attitudes.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.640
 Completely different zone, zone of the mental beautiful status. Truly we begin to shy the nature of

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:58.000
 beauty of the minds, call it the mind, the Buddha nature of the mind.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:07.400
 If they begin to shy, reading, poor boneless dungli practices. All that, with that reflected in the

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:15.000
 physical forms and then generosity, moralities, those all coming, one after that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.410
 Again they all blended together with each other, not separated all. More gentle, more peaceful,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:30.000
 more calm, more soothing, more happy, more joy, more devotions, more synchronous connections,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 connections with the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, all those in life things.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.160
 Inspired by their activities, to our heart and mind is hard-headed, self, self, always self-

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.000
important attitude or self-important minds. Really inspired by their activities.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:59.580
 How so beautiful, how calming, how soothing, and so kind, so patient, so generous. Always ready to

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:08.000
 help, support, yet always kind, complete with respect, with politeness.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.920
 Those are excellent qualities in human society too. Don't mention in Dharma, yet all those are good

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.000
 qualities, good behaviors.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.860
 But that now is not just a pretend day or a joy that without moment, but it is really coming from

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:37.130
 the heart. So sweet, it is also totally free from, free from self-important, all the expectations,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.000
 return something back there.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 It is free, open, as sky, as sunlight, shining there. That is so wonderful and so sweet.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.160
 And with that, then in the Mahayana teaching, the very idea, Mahayana teaching, what is the

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:03.720
 teaching? So now, three isolations. Isolation of the body, isolation of the mind from the money

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:11.000
 conceptions, then in the Mahayana, in the teaching, it is mostly important, along with that, is

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 isolations of the self-important attitude of the mind.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.610
 That is the Mahayana. Why is bodhicitta? Bodhicitta, because bodhicitta is all living in such front

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:33.000
. Everyone is front. Even I talk roughly because of my compassion.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.180
 I talk bodhicitta about because of my compassion. Now I'm practicing, I actually like bodhicitta

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.000
 because of compassion.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.780
 Therefore, now I'm going to do retreat. So, for that reason, also I'm going to do isolations of the

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.000
 self-important attitude that we have all the time.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Self-important attitude or self-important concept and thought from the biggest times until now.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:13.650
 Now we're reversing that. We practice dongli, dongli practice. What is dongli practice? It's simple

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:21.000
 to say what all the dongli practice means, free from our self-important thoughts. Self-important.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:32.100
 We are not number one. Code and bodhicitta, then sentient beings are number ones. Number one. No

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.000
 more regular time. We are number one.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.760
 Or our self, or each of us, we are the number ones. We are "I", for example, capital "I". We are "I

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.000
" representing the "I", the capital, not the low case, high case.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.940
 That's what the really represent. But this is fine. The sentient beings are capital. Beings are

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.000
 capital. "I" is small.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 That is so free from the attitude of the self-important.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 With that self-important, now free from that self-important, now we begin to practice.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.090
 Now I mentioned that cause, sixth cause, as a great master Kamala Shraddha mentioned, listed

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:31.000
 clearly as he condenses it from the whole, the form of the opportunity, put that as a six.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:40.110
 This six, what I meant yesterday, is the cause. But it's not just a cause. It is how to maintain

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.000
 our practices.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.980
 These six are how we're going to maintain our meditation and practices. This is what we're going to

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.000
 maintain.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 So this is the maintainer, okay, in that way. Maintainer, manual of the instructions.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.210
 And if we continue maintaining, it is also bring the fulfillment, successful. So it's instructing

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:12.000
 for the successful how we're going to make the successful of our practice or our meditation.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.260
 That is what really is. This six is not just cause, then complete Kamala Shraddha. You give up that

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:26.000
. This we're going to keep continuing. That is six.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.540
 We're going to continue until we reach enlightenment. Or until at least we achieve the first

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.000
 booming realization.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.440
 That, but that strength is then, when you reach it, positive booming for the same path, that is we

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.000
 don't have to make effort according to the teaching.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.150
 Not too much. It continues, that pulse continue to go on. As what in the teaching mentioned,

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.000
 sometimes you use example.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.980
 In ancient, of course, this ancient time. Ancient time, for example, with those pottery, clear pot

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.000
tery, there are special tools called wheel of the pottery makers.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.840
 Makers. When they come, in order to make the pottery there, and at the beginning of the time they

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.000
 have to make effort to turn that wheel.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.260
 They have to turn once. Once they reach to the level, they don't have to turn all the time. It is

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.000
 spinning. It is spinning and you're doing the jobs, the pottery jobs.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.460
 Similarly, at the beginning of the practice, in the Bodhisattva, it is like ultimate, you have to

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.000
 make joyful effort.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Of the virtues, courage and commitment, determination, all that. Really keep the vigilance.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Vigilance with the relaxed and with the calm manance. Manance. Then it moves. It checks by itself.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 It lift up by itself.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Then you can, in a way, enjoy the sweetness of that and keep that modern, not let it slow down.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Or not let it slow down, then it's six, what? Major. Great Master Kamachala Major.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 That was six hours. Continue to maintain it. Continue to bring the fruit patience. Bring patience.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:25.670
 So that is what this six hours, that six calls we went yesterday, or maybe the day before yesterday

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.000
, I mentioned that with you.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:35.480
 So that is what. Now, once we have that calls, that six calls, conditions of calls that I called

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.000
 Master Kamachala Major,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 then we now begin to do the meditation, all the dhyam paramatas. Now, today, it has five obstacles

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 we should avoid.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.760
 That is five obstacles. What in the teaching? Great Master. Of course, again, he is a Buddha, a s

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.000
icha, personarized by the materials.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.570
 I get it. And it says the five are. Those five are the first is our familiar, familiar, familiar

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:14.000
 figure or familiar companion, companion.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:25.460
 Who is that? The ladiness. Master or mis-ladiness? That is first. First is always with us. It's

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.000
 like shadow. It comes like shadow.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 So that is, in this case, that even though it's been long call of a companion, but it is obstacle.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:46.350
 So first is the ladiness. The ladiness. Second is then procating the instructions. Second is proc

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.000
ating the instructions.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And then third is sinking mind and wide mind. Sinking and wide. And then port is too much effort,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 too much effort is port obstacles.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:31.200
 And the pit is too loose. Loose. On the other way, maybe I can translate it as port one is too

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.000
 tight. And second is too loose.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:49.050
 So those are five obstacles. Well, we do the meditation or practices. Those are five obstacles.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.000
 That's it.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:11.660
 And what is the ability, he said, that is, those are the five. I translated that roughly into

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.000
 English.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.600
 Oh, I'm saying roughly, but maybe that's the only way. I don't know. You all know that. You can

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.000
 check that, clearly yourself there.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:29.910
 But those five are obstacles. First is the ladiness. The ladiness. That we went during joyful

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:34.000
 effort, virtuous practice, the ladiness.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:43.140
 Those are the three ladiness. Three are good friend, companion, three ladiness. First is regular

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:49.000
 ladiness, always companion ladiness.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:58.910
 Second is self-blaming ladiness. And the third is ladiness of the kind of glued with old habit

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.000
 pattern activities.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.340
 So those are three ladiness. The fourth ladiness is a regular. That is just a regular, standard lad

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.000
iness.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.500
 So we don't want to do, kind of like, not motivate it. When it comes to do, we use some different

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.000
 kind of terminology.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.400
 I don't have time, but I will do after work, this one, tomorrow, day after tomorrow, or this

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.000
 afternoon I'm going to do, or this evening I'm going to do, kind of delay, delay.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.210
 And then we may be distracted and forget. Those are just a routine, regular, the easy, occurring

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.000
 ladiness.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.640
 It shows up. And always ladiness. Then this ladiness, the second ladiness is like, this courage,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.000
 self-blaming.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.490
 Self-blaming, all this is my fault, I can do this, such as I don't have the capabilities, I don't

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:57.000
 have, I know my, all those previous combinations and all that, I can do this.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.220
 I mean, all different things we use. But whatever that is, slowing down, again our practice and

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.000
 meditation and completely jeopardizing that.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.390
 So that is the second ladiness. Third ladiness is old habit pattern. We went through that habit

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.000
 pattern, kind of hanging over that,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 indicated with that, forced and continually kind of like, just all that, one after another.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.170
 And just routine activity, what we used to do, watching movies or YouTube, on the telephones, all

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.000
 those things.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And then plus more, more of those are the ladiness. So that is the first, first ladiness.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.070
 Second, that this obstacle, or those are the, I mean, the first obstacles of the meditation or the

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.000
 practice.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Third, the second one is the pocket in the instructions, instructions, that what we received.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.330
 This pocket in the instructions, how to do, start the practices or the pocket in the instructions

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.000
 during the practices.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 We needed that, instructions, or our practice, forget our practices and forget them.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 That is why happening because of the lack of mindfulness, mindfulness.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 And we are so kind of out of space, mind, space, and then we are perfect.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 We forgot our instructions, meditations, our instructions, all that.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And third one is, then sinking the mind.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 I translate it, sinking mind. But mind, sinking means, means, it means sinking mind.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.980
 All mind is become very kind of pokey, low energy, and not clarity, kind of pokey, pokey, all those

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.000
 are known as,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 ching mai, pho, sinking mind. That is, again, obstacles.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 And then second, the next one is gopa.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Gopa means, wild, scared, restless, agitated mind, mind.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And that is also obstacles for the meditations.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.200
 And fourth one is, then using so much antidotes, or so much effort, so much kind of forceful, so

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.000
 tight.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 That is also obstacles.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 And the next one is, fifth one is, obstacles of the day, not, applying the antidote,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.340
 or not applying kind of making more effort to stay kind of more fulfillment, and to lose. That is

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.000
 obstacles.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 So those all are known as, five obstacles.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 In the teaching method, the first two are, obstacles to start practices.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 And which is, laziness, pocket and stockings is obstacle, particularly to start practices.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.730
 Of course, during the practices, there are also obstacles, but particularly it is obstacle to start

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.000
 practices.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And then this third one, ching mind, gopa, sinking and wild mind,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 as there were one in the teaching named.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So that is obstacles for the quality of the meditation, the practices.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Now you, for example, you didn't have the laziness, I put it like this way.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 We don't have the laziness, that we avoided, and we did not forget our instruction.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 We remember, and now I'm putting in practices.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Now in the practices, meditation, we are sitting on cushion, or in a chair, wherever we are, we are

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.000
.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 But our mind, during that time, our mind is sinking, our mind is poking,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 our mind becomes blue, and low energy.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 What is that? That is obstacles for the quality of the meditation, or practice.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Even you are sitting on the meditation, practicing, our quality of the meditation is defective,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 and it's staying at meditation, it's staying.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 At the same way, during that time, when you are practicing time,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 our mind is completely kind of like wild, and scared, and thinking about all the different things,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 thoughts and emotions, thinking.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Then, even when sitting on the cushion, or in a chair, by delegating that practice,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 for whatever that hour, the quality of the quality of our meditation, the practice is losted.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Also. So therefore, in the teachings, the third obstacle is particularly obstacle

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 during the quality of meditation, or the quality of the practices.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 If we don't have those obstacles, during our meditation,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 our mind is constantly calm and peaceful, then it's really called meditation,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 called practices. It's perfect meditation, perfect practices.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 And so then, at the last, the fourth and fifth obstacles.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 In the teachings, there are obstacles to progress, to progress.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 If we have too much forceful, it will slow down our achievement,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 of the realization, of performance.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 If it's too loose, also it will slow down.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 So then what? Then he said, just write, write.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Not too much forceful, not too loose, but write, stand.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Write the stand. That is what really the teaching says.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 So then it will bring beautiful progress, progress.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 So that is what those are, the five obstacles of the meditations.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 So now, for example, what we went through now,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 we went through the cause of the meditation, of the practices,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 good cause, that as spoken by Kamal Chela.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 And then we went through the five obstacles,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 as highlighted by the great master material or the ascenders,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 that we went through.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Now it comes to the meditation, or the practices.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 And into the practices, then in the teaching,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 always, and we all know that, always good postures.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 You do, have the good postures.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 That is really the important, important.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 So those things, postures, and as well as the other,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 all the divisions of the, of the, the, the, the D'Am paramata,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 I think we already, already went, went those divisions,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 the three divisions of the D'Am, of course, into the D'Am paramata.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Last time, I think, oh, this time we went, I went,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 but we, I talk again, and those things.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 And, and of course, you all know these, what's called, post,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 the positions, postures of the meditative, you all know.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 But again, our, just a reprieve of our memories.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 And then I talk those things later, later,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 and the next time we, we'll be again made in Zoom highways.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Thank you very much. That's my talk.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Thank you very much for participating.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And now we go to the right to the practice.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Practicer of the Bodhi Mena.
