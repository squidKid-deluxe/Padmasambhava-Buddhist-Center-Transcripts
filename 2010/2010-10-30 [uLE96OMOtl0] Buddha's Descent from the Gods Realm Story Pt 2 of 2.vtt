00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 In Vinaya there is a rule that spiritual powers, even they have the spiritual power, cannot use the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.750
 spiritual power to use the advantage of one's own purposes, and that is a mistake, and so that is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:28.000
 one of the rules in the Vinaya, and that is my end of story.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 She is very famous, and she was so beautiful when she was young, and she is beautiful and young,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.720
 and then she attracted so many purposes, one after another, and then finally she thought, "Oh, she

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.000
 can do anything."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.360
 And so, Ati is a Mongol Buddha, not a Chari Buddha, and he meditated, and he and one man, in a way,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 had a boyfriend, and they both said, "Look at this man, sitting under the body of the tree, he is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.660
 so calm and peaceful looking, peaceful, looks like a completely, deeply, worldly desire, desire

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.000
 anything."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 And he said, "I don't think so, I don't think so." She said, "She must be the same as everyone," he

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 said. And then he said, "No, I don't think so. He looks really different than us."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 He said, "What, we bet," she said, "We bet. Have I ever to, what's called, seduce him? What are you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.000
 going to do?" And then I don't remember what they said, "I will do something."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.720
 And so she said, "Yes, I can seduce anyone." And she went right there, and she did all this,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.000
 whatever there, and now she's ready.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.730
 Nothing really moved, nothing changed at all. He's sitting there, just, and then she started

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.000
 grabbing him there, trying to grab him.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:35.640
 And that moment, she said, "Mongol," or "Chariotat," elevated up in the sky, almost like this palm

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.660
 tree is high, palm tree. And that moment, she moved completely, and she felt so sad what she did,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 and tried to do it, she felt so, and then she completely fell down on the ground and asked, "Oh, a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 great novel one, please forgive me."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.670
 "And guide me from this mud." And then, so he came down, and Chariotat, and gave the teaching, and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.000
 that's how, then, her turning point, and then she become one of the great Arhatas.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.290
 And her name was Upali. Upali is a Sanskrit word, which means "blue lotus," blue lotus. Her

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.970
 compilation in the teachings is so beautiful as like flower petals, and therefore, a parent also

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.000
 named her as Upali, Upali. So this is one of the great Arhatas.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Okay.
