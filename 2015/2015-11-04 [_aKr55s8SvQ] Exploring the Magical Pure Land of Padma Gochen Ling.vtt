 Coming up to Padma Gochen Ling, let's see if I can drive and see if I can find it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 If I can find it, let's see if I can find it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 [Singing]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Let's see, is it here?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 House.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Is it Bob's house?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Here is where we can quite see temple over here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And everybody parks here.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 I am going to set up my tent.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Somewhere here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 I am going to set up my tent.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Like this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Places like this.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Okay.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 I will set up my tent, thank you.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Okay.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Oh no, I just shot you.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 I came up here.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 I will need the mail.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 There she is.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Field.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Here is the temple.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Outhouse.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 I will show you.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 One more thing.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Here is the temple.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 You can kind of see.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Like this.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 I am going to come in here.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Is that fine?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Maybe they are in there.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Okay, this is a long video.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Now I come down here.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 This is coming to the song house.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Coming to the song house.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 See?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 No parking in the vicinity of the temple.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 I am walking up here.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Okay.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 I will make a video for a drop off.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 And then,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 there is the song house.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 See?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That's it. Another couple of outhouses.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Back here.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And mountains.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 A bunch of cars.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 More mountains and ridges.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 this is pretty much it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Alright.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Much love to you guys.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 I don't think I am going to go in there.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 There is people in there.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Okay.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 What's up drop off.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 talk to you later.
