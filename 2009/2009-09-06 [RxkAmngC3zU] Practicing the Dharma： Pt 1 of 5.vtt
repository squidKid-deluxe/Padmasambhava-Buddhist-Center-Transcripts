00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.410
 We have to tell it used to be. We have to learn. We have to dribble. We have to in a way create a

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 rhythm in our mind stream so that we will ignite it from always joy and appreciation in our self,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 in our situation, in our circumstances, with that quality and then help to the others with the love

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.000
 and compassion.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.730
 And that is practice and that is also have to kind of let it grow. We have some things to be taught

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.490
 or we all have that. But our work is very unstable. Our love and compassion, joy and appreciation,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:54.740
 quite grateful, graceful, is very weak and very kind of like temporary, sometimes here and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.000
 sometimes gone.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.520
 And therefore we have to bring that more stabilized and make that more strong in our mind and heart

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.000
.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.030
 Alaya. Alaya, that is we have to imprint all those good gods. It's there but we have to mostly

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 water. We have to nourish, take care so that joy and appreciation and kindness and compassion is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.000
 always there.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 All the time is like eliminating our self or glowing our self and that glow of that. And that have

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.000
 to start by one's own self.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:31.320
 And practice Dharma is not any coming in outside and of course we all know that. You know, you know

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.000
 and everybody knows. Practice Dharma have to start with our self.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.800
 Our self also we will be talking our self individually. That means start from the heart. From the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.630
 heart and from the heart, from the mind. Mind to the heart and heart to the our self, then our self

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.000
.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.990
 So Dharma practice begin with from our innermost core of the mind and heart. That is what it is.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.000
 And then what is it? This is mind.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.180
 There is so many varieties of the mind. But the mind is as Buddha said, all mind can be summarized

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.780
 into three categories. All different aspects of our mental thought and those are positive, negative

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.000
 and neutral.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.910
 There is nothing more than that. This mind, all our active mind sits within that three frame or

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.000
 three categories.
