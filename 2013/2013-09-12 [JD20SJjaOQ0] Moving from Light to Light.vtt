00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Song are going from traveling from light to light.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 And so they are going from light to the ultimate light.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 And the song are going from the dark to the darkness.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And the song are going from the dark to the light state to the dark.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And the song are going from the dark to the light state.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.520
 There are four different types of the travelers of sentient beings because of their deeds, their

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.000
 actions, that leading.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Among that four, our goal is from light to light.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 We are in light. We have beautiful lives.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 In the teaching of the Buddha, according to the teaching of the Buddha, we are within something

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 beautiful things in our past.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Therefore, we are in a beautiful life now. We have really beautiful lives.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Our intelligence, our senses, our patience, our situation, circumstances, all is beautiful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 All is quite good. Quite good.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 These good things not just come by accidentally, they not just come by patiently.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 There is definitely beautiful cause and conditions behind what we have.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Even though we didn't see immediately right now that truly we have something good things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Because of our present situation, we can deduct, we can inference that we did something in the past

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.000
.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And because of that, we are in light now. Beautiful light status.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And we are human beings with beautiful intelligence and human beings.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 This is light. This is light.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Now next to our destination, we like to move exactly the same way, even better light status.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 That next destination is dependent, according to the teaching, dependent with our actions now,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 activity over now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Whatever future that is directed by the present of our activities.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.750
 As every time, every evening in samsara we will do something, very much our future is relying on

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 how we do now.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Now is in a way the engine, the will to change the directions of the future.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So similarly, this is what this time, this person is our how we like to change the next lines.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So there, with joyful effort, we don't let rule by the absolute, totally 100% laziness.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Laziness also we make three types of laziness.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Whatever laziness is, it is laziness.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 It is undermining our principle of the goodness, our visions.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Lady is disturbing. Lady slows down. Lady spoils. Lady could miss our opportunity to be missed.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So therefore, he said, might that ourself move from light to light.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.520
 Not from, of course, we are not in the dark that we don't take examples, but not from light to the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.000
 dark.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 That is what we don't want.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 We have to move from light to light.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 In order to do that, what we have to do?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Again, back to the same thing as this great teacher said.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Really, with six parabola practice, generosity, love, patience, generosity, morality,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 I mean this six parabola practice, context of that, and good activities.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 All our readiness, all our capabilities, to bring, open up that energy, that draw, that opportunity

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.000
,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 not shut down, that it is in our hand, nobody else's hand.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Whatever activity we like to do is my hand.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Whatever I like to do, activity is my hand, nobody else's hand.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And totally we can do.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So for that reason, we are really trying to make that.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Make our self moving from light to light.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 That is, it's really about that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 So to do this is, then, what do we call it?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 To do this is the joy of effort.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 So don't let your joy of effort, your good deeds run by laziness.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Three types of laziness, whatever those three types of laziness, is laziness.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 It will spoil that, as I said.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.840
 So that, and the next one is.
