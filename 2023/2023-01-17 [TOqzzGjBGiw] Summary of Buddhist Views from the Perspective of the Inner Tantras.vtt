Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 "View is something that we are really going to woo. So that means we are going to see something,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.680
 see things according to the Nyingma school and particularly in the Tantra, divided into

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:27.760
 that highlighted as three woo's. Those are known woo of the way things are, or seeing

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.400
 exactly the reality or reality pairs of the way things are, seeing as a view of the way

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.520
 things are, seeing exactly as it is, and then the view of the nature of the way things are,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.320
 and then seeing the view of one's own awareness, one's own yak, rupak, or the awareness, or

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.560
 symbol I can say mind, nature of the mind seeing that. So now among that three, which is principle,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 which according to the teaching, the third one, the woo, that woo's of the one's own

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 awareness is principle, because that which is really wooed object, that which is wooed

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.680
 of the nature of the object, and then the woo of the natural of the one's own awareness.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 So the final one, principle one, is the woo of the one's own awareness. And this time that woo,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.320
 what we are discussing of the object, the view of the reality, the view of the object of this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.080
 relative truth, and view of the nature of the related truths, this is, as I said, the other day,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.920
 and it is every simple word ever used, is the relative truth, the absolute truth. So seeing

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.650
 the relative truth exactly as it is, exactly as it is, that means seeing the purity aspect of

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.000
 reality

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 or relative truth as it is. The purity aspect of relative truth is, then everything in like the six

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.040
.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.400
 All five aggregates are enlightened. Five elements are enlightened. So all is a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 conscious enlightened, as I said, five aggregates include those are conscious too. So it's all

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 enlightened. That is enlightened. And nature of the enlightened is, that five aggregates is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.240
 emptiness, or is openness. And I think that whenever you now know emptiness, what it means,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.400
 is emptiness means there is no substantial solid existence. All is like, is gathered of the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 particles,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.640
 all different particles are really homed up and both, homed that. But reality level, there is no

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.370
 substantial solid entity, entities at all. Whether we're thinking of the poem, whether we're

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.560
 thinking

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 of the poem aggregates, whether we're thinking of the feeling aggregates, everyone, as if you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.200
 discount like, we, we nominated or we gotta hold that their, their formation and the continuation,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.040
 then we hold as homes. But reality really, that continuation is changing. And essentially, there's

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.760
 no permanent state that is continually changing. And it's all the way the poem is also is, is all

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.880
 the particles come together. It's not just came like that from the beginning spine. It's homed

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.920
 newly. So this is a hallucination for that reason, immigration teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni used

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:00.640
 examples as reflection moon in the waters, or illusions, all that as the appearance or the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.600
 perceptions of the daturas, daturas. And all, when you, when you see these perceptions, when you

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 see

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.840
 these looks like is existed, but reality is just temporarily due to the different circumstances,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.920
 it appeared, but then no substantial solid exists. So according to teaching, the poem, this

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.480
 external

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.880
 poem, and our own poem is really constantly changing status. There's no substantial solid existing.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 So therefore, it's called emptiness is like openness space, because why that changing is

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.280
 happening? There's so many spaces, we do even looks like so solid, conquering, but it's changing,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:53.360
 it's moving constantly. So this is the space that each of particles are also if you break down,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.960
 there's no substantial solid entity, even the sliced ones. Those reasons in the teaching said,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.680
 is old. And those are the use, the reasons of logics, to discover. And then feelings,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.080
 perception, consultant, is the whole continuation. There's no solid existence.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.760
 So there's a discoverer of that innate nature, that even is a divine mandala, all this

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.120
 enlightened state, yet it is display of the divine, display of the illusions of the divine,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.080
 or magic and disciplines. For that reason, the English teacher, Brother Hector Muniz said,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.810
 even there's something higher than enlightenment, that is magic, that is dreaming, that is illusion

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.920
.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.680
 There's nothing else. It didn't mean illusion, magic, and dream, that didn't mean that it's

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.520
 unfunctionable, untrue. It's perfectly true. It functions exactly where things are there. It will

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.360
 function in illusion perfectly. Illusion works on the illusions. The dream works on the dreams.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.960
 It's not something that is not good. This consumption is good or nothing. That is duality.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.920
 But reality, they own everything in the really open states. So that is what is like these three

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:29.770
 words of this. All the poems are seen, the poems, every poem, are seen exactly as it is, as

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.720
 enlightened,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.600
 and it is natural, are also in a magical emptiness or the Dharma, Dato status, as it is. Both these

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.840
 empty poems and this emptiness are union status, and that is preceded by one's own awareness.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.200
 And the awareness itself is, is that what the nature of the awareness is? It's the emptiness.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:02.320
 So the view of the one's own awareness is emptiness, openness. There is no substantial

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.680
 solid existing entities. So that is really the views, basically. Then, of course, there is more

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.240
 kind of detail, specifically for views, and then according to Brother Chikin, Chikin's views of the

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.640
 basic Buddhist schools, views of the Mahayana schools, views of the of the generally very

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.840
 energy case, kind of highlighted that way. And the view of the basic Buddhist school,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.200
 Hungarian Buddhist school is then ego-less in the state. See, there is no ego existence at all

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:43.920
 in any place in our form. We all, we always think of such as "I", but there is no substantive

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.240
 really

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.920
 existing. Any "E" "I", that if we look, which poem, what is how that poem, they call it a teaching,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:02.080
 and they say, is, we hold such as "I" or the ego, or identity, or such as name, for example.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.240
 My name is Campbell, Campbell 7. When people see, "Oh, he's Campbell's, he is." And I think also,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.600
 I'm Campbell's, Campbell's. But reality, what is this Campbell's? Campbell's is the continuation

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:23.280
 of my poems, and then combination of the of the all these aggregates, or the poems,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.360
 limbs, and head, and everything kind of come together in a way, holding together, that holding

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:37.760
 together, and the continuation, that continuation and holding together, we name as Campbell.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.600
 But reality, they say, "What is Campbell's?" There's no, that applies to everything. We hold with

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.160
 titles, we hold this, but it's the only idea we name. It's not something solidly really existing.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:09:01.520
 So then similarly, "I", "I" or "I", "I am here, I am, I am not going to this." We just kind of,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:09.120
 without thinking, without analyzing, investigating, kind of presuming that, "Oh, I'm, I'm here,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.040
 I'm going to this and that." We, of course, it works in a relative department. This is nothing

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.600
 wrong,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:23.680
 but we're talking of the reality exists and all. Reality did not exist. There's nothing. Then,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.000
 we do, for example, the fourth benefit of the "I" thinking. We do so many, so many activity,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:37.200
 videos, that un-beneficial activities, or we do so many activities to try to serve to our "I",

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.000
 "I" in health, and then we get also so many different headaches.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.360
 No, no. That is what's called in the Buddha's teaching. Then we created so much

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:57.600
 karmas, and then emotions such as them, of course, all different negative emotions arise with that

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.240
 and create it. Even at the reality level, these emotions are also really empty. There's no solid

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:13.360
 existence existing. That is not something that conquer existing. It's arising from emptiness.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.120
 It's happening to the emptiness, and then we perform in that, creating that, continue holding

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.480
 that, and then there's also happening emptiness, and then dissolving, merging back to the emptiness

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.600
,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.400
 or to the way it comes from. So, what is there, actually? For that is nothing really existing,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:41.440
 solid, as we believe. For that reason, it's called emptiness. So, in Buddhism, the basic

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.800
 Buddhist schools, or the fundraising Buddhist schools practice as egolessness, and that is not

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.320
 just the basic Buddhist school. That is applied to the Mahayana and Vayayana too. That is the

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:03.840
 foundation. So, it's an egolessness practice. So, view of the egolessness, and then that is view.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.080
 In the Mahayana teaching, above the egolessness, or self-egolessness, self-egolessness state,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.360
 and then they practice. Again, they've got to discover that there is not just self-ego-ness,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.840
 everything is empty. Everything is an illusion, illusion state. This is not something only that

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.800
 eyes, the whole object and subject are really like magical. It's dreamlike. There's no

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.240
 substantial solace existing, yet it's performing, and occasionally functioning perfectly on the

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:45.920
 related level, or illusion level, but reality is not solid. Discovering that, exactly as it is,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:55.200
 is, that's the true egolessness in the Vayayana teaching. Self-ego-lessness and

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.400
 phenomenal egolessness. That means not solid existing phenomenon too.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:12.320
 Above that, Vayayana sees, then that same thing, foundation the same, but then they discover again,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:20.000
 entirely everything is egolessness or the emptiness, yet it's combined with wisdom,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.640
 the great blissfulness, wisdom. So, wisdom and emptiness are union, all in a union status.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:38.720
 So, that's not just all. Emptiness is as an object. The only emptiness which is to discover

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:46.800
 that emptiness is our mind. And mind is empty, and mind is wisdom and compassion states.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.200
 For those reasons, and the Mahayana, particularly Vayayana, highlighted, you hear the union of the

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:01.280
 emptiness and compassion, everything in that status. That is the rule, meditating.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.080
 So, that is what's really about the rules now.
