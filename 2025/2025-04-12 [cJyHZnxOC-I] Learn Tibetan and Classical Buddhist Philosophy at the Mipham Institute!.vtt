NOTE     "synopsis": "The Mipham Institute was created in order to preserve and transmit the authentic vajrayana lineage of Tibetan Buddhism by making it possible for students to study the Tibetan language and the Dharma teachings in a deep and authentic way. The Institute will follow closely the model of a Tibetan shedra, offering in depth study of the Indian Buddhist classic treatises with commentaries by the great Tibetan lineage teachers, always in light of treating Dharma teachings as pith instructions to be applied in practice in accordance with the living tradition.\n\nMipham Institute offers a program of study centered on two main components: Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy.\n\nI. Tibetan Language\n\nThe Institute\u2019s program on Tibetan language is designed to help students master basic competence in reading classical Tibetan, so that they can develop basic proficiency in reading Tibetan Buddhist literature, fluency in pronunciation and reading, and the capacity to consult commentaries in order to elucidate the meaning of classical scripture. While the program does not emphasize conversational Tibetan, that does not mean that oral competence is not important, and students will be encouraged to develop some degree of listening comprehension for oral commentary and basic Dharma conversation, for example. Our Tibetan programs focus on acquiring a solid understanding of Tibetan linguistics based on the traditional Tibetan grammatical tradition. \n\nII. Buddhist philosophy\n\nOur program in Buddhist philosophy will cover the main points of the view of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, especially Madhyamaka or Middle Way philosophy. The courses will proceed in the Tibetan shedra style of studying a selection of the great Indian Buddhist classics as root text with the help of oral commentary by a qualified scholar. These courses will be supplemented by a review class and complementary classes covering the background, context, and interpretation of these texts. Complementary classes will cover topics such as Buddhist history, methodology for Buddhist study, Buddhist epistemology and logic, and the overview of the main Buddhist philosophical schools.\n\nLearn more and Apply:\nwww.miphaminstitute.org\n\nContact us at the Mipham Institute:\ncontact@miphaminstitute.org\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 Couldn't be here tonight and so they can watch it later.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.080
 OK, now I think everybody's muted, so welcome, everyone, and thanks for coming.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.400
 So this is a session for especially for those who are interested in coming and studying with our

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.720
 new program at Mipham Institute.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.490
 So we're very excited to get this started officially like that and meet some of you for the first

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 time.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.320
 The way we plan to run this is I have a short presentation to cover the main points or the main

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 elements of information.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.690
 Really, everything is already on the website, but sometimes it's easier to explain it a little bit

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.920
 more.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.200
 And I'll try to do that very quickly.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 And afterwards, everybody will get a chance to ask more specific questions.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.000
 I think for some of you are perhaps considering actually joining the program.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.760
 You may have like some practical, very specific questions, so I think it may be useful for you to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.400
 get a chance to ask those.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.720
 So what we'll do is I'll start right away with the presentations and afterwards for the question

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.400
 session, I would ask you to type the questions in the chat.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.840
 In the chat function of the presentation.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.500
 And I think that's the most efficient way of having the questions asked and answered, and then we

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.100
'll go through each one individually and hopefully hopefully we'll have time to answer every concern

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 or question you may have.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.400
 So I'm going to go ahead with the slides.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:38.160
 Thanks, everyone, for joining.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.120
 It's very nice to see all some known people and some new also.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.720
 And here is the slideshow.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.680
 So these are just a very few basic points of information that I have created in order to go over

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.400
 the main points.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 And, of course, it's not going. Yeah, so just the introduction MIPAM Institute is quite a new

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.190
 project even for me a few months ago, I didn't even know we were going to start this project on the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.120
 Padma Sambhava Buddhist Center, but it really started last summer in July.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 When I was in TSL and under the sort of encouragement and recommendation of our teacher, and I can

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.020
 put someone in much I can put someone down there much I was there and somehow the elements came

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.560
 into place together with.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 can put a much in with the family foundation and with PSL and the idea came up of starting sort of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.460
 natural continuation of our programs with BBC and to expand a little bit our activity for those who

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.880
 have a little bit more time and interest to focus on learning Tibetan in the Buddhist view in more

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.480
 detail.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.760
 So I was asked by much to kind of start and work with this program and kind of get it started, but

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.320
 really, like in last June, I had no idea we're going to do this.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.120
 But we also decided to just go ahead. So we're planning to launch our programs, as you know, I

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.730
 think those of you who are here, you've read our website from next fall, from September and it's a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.840
 three year program and it's a big commitment.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.850
 So we want to give everybody a chance to ask their questions. But really, the main thing to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.560
 understand is that we really see me upon institute as fitting within the activities of BBC.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:53.350
 And as a natural continuation of the teachings of Venerable Kampura Moches and really to go and

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.790
 develop more programs to go a little bit more in depth for those who want to apply this kind of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.440
 study part of Buddhist tradition as we received it from Tibetan lineage masters.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 As you know, within BBC, we've had Tibetan language over the years, several programs. We've also

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.200
 had a very rich Sheta series.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.850
 Starting, I think, from the early 2000s for people who studied the philosophy, but this is to make

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.320
 it a little bit more formal, a little bit more robust.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.200
 And so this is what the Mipham Institute is about. The name Mipham Institute was chosen by Ramache.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.580
 We need to highlight our connection with that great teacher, Mipham Ramache, who considered to be

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.440
 kind of a main lineage teacher for us.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 But also for our teacher at the late Venerable Kenshin, Adenshara Ramache, who was so close to Mip

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.560
ham, who himself composed many commentaries on his works and also always emphasize the teachings of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.080
 Mipham

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.830
 for like the sadhanas and practice and commentaries and so forth. And so we see ourselves as the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.720
 natural continuation also of our

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.760
 connection with that great teacher.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.900
 So just I'm going to go very quickly over the main goals of the program. The goal is to develop an

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.960
 in-depth connection with the lineage teachings.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.500
 Of course, there is a kind of with Mipham Institute, there will be a little bit more of an academic

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.040
 dimension to the teaching and the kind of kind of study we're going to do.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.760
 That means going into the philosophical commentaries with more detail, more depth.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.100
 But it's really not something completely fundamentally different from the way we've been receiving

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.320
 teachings and practicing over the years, is to just

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.500
 study not the way we do, for example, in the universities for academic purposes, theoretical or

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.910
 purely historical or humanities kind of thing, but really as a way to connect with the practice

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.480
 lineage.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.440
 It's also a goal of the institute to foster and encourage a new kind of a continuing generation of

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.640
 students who can learn the Tibetan language.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.000
 So we have a little bit more time

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.980
 to have some people who are comfortable both with Tibetan and English and sort of facilitate the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.830
 more in-depth transmission of the teachings over the next years by having people who are familiar

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.240
 with both languages and can

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.920
 read in Tibetan, read teachings, commentaries, but also apply that to practice.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.090
 Our approach to studying Buddhist philosophy is we're trying to stay as close as possible to the

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.520
 lineage teachings and the lineage kind of methods.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.490
 In our Nima school, that was mostly developed in the 19th century, based on commentaries by Mipham

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.600
 and the different shiras that were built

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.320
 in Tibet, but also very much in line with the way it is studied right now in places like here in M

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.200
ipham, in India.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.970
 And within the monasteries, of course, there are some differences, but we're trying to follow a

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.440
 similar approach and really if somebody asked me, what is our approach to the study of Buddhist

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.640
 thought and Buddhist philosophy.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:53.550
 My kind of simple way of putting it is approaching and viewing teachings as big instructions to be

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.630
 applied to our own life and not as intellectual curiosities for intellectual history and not as a

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.120
 sort of anthropology of Buddhist views.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.410
 And not as, I mean, whatever the theoretical goals maybe people have in academia, but really as

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.720
 something to be applied to our own lives.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.520
 That is the main approach, which is also the way

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.060
 often we see the teachings described in the non-sectarian approach of really treating all Buddhist

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.480
 teachings as big instructions and try to

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.360
 understand them so we can apply them to our own life, our own practice.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.210
 Regarding the contents of the program, I think you all read from the website, we're trying to

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.560
 launch a three-year program.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.000
 Maybe you can see all this. I don't know how.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.270
 Three years, so it's not just a program where people come casually and take apart here and there.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.960
 We're trying to really create a cohort of students who are going to take the whole program.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.780
 The reason for that is that in our experience with classical Tibetan, learning Tibetan in the

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.570
 Dharma Center, it's difficult to create a sense of commitment over a long time and sense of

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.480
 continuity where people really progress

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.500
 by following a curriculum and we often end up starting from the beginning again and again and not

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.560
 really getting some progress. So now we're trying to create the conditions for people to be able to

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.320
 really study and

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.280
 improve so that

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.800
 in the end they develop some familiarity and some also confidence in reading and using Tibetan.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.280
 The goal for Tibetan language is very important to understand because I heard also some questions

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.080
 about that last week is classical Tibetan is what we're going to be teaching. Not conversation.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.880
 We're not going to do classes on going to the restaurant and ordering food or that kind of thing.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.680
 It's really focusing on learning Tibetan grammar

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.160
 and learning in the classical language, the language that is used for Dharma teachings. The goal is

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.800
 to be able to read commentaries, read the teachings

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.750
 from Indian Shastras and their translation and read the commentaries, but also to some extent to be

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:06.370
 able to read practice texts in Tibetan, which sometimes we still do also the sadhanas, for example,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:06.400
 in the

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.560
 practice together in Tibetan and so to also help students do that because it really is the same

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.280
 language. Now that being said, it doesn't mean we're just going to be reading silently and kind of

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.120
 treating it as a

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.760
 bad language. There is a way to use classical Tibetan, whether it's in our study of the philosophy

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.880
 or in practice as a living language.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.360
 OK, so it's not like we're not we're still going to be talking about pronunciation and being able

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.600
 to talk, being able to ask questions, for example, in class in Tibetan, eventually not right from

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.760
 the beginning, probably, but eventually, but really not focusing on everyday

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.360
 conversational Tibetan.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:51.390
 That decision really is from our sort of sense of wanting to focus on the main goals of the program

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.520
.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.280
 Also, in my experience, if somebody learns really good classical Tibetan, it's also quite easy

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.440
 after, if they want to learn conversational Tibetan, to pick it up.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.820
 But the main factor seems to be immersion, being able to live in a place where there are Tibetan

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.880
 speakers and applying the knowledge of the language to learn it.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.640
 And so and there are a lot of places where you can study that already.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.200
 So we decide we're not going to be focusing on that for our program.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.440
 Second, regarding the philosophy, we're doing Shraddha style.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.560
 So Intubate, as you know, often the monastery is at both Shraddha and Dhrubdha.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.070
 Dhrubdha are the retreat programs for people to go into meditation retreats and focus on the

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.120
 practice.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.160
 And Shraddha is the kind of explanation part or the intellectual part, you could say, where people

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.910
 really study in-depth the view, the teachings of the Buddha and try to get a lot of clarity on

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.440
 their meaning.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.200
 And their importance and how to understand them.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.040
 So that is how we see it.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.540
 I think we have already at Bhimasam Yelling and Padmasambhava Buddhist Centre, kind of Dhrubdha, I

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.720
 expect, because there are much as I've been teaching so many things over the years.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.480
 We've received so many teachings and we've had also some focus on understanding philosophy in view.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.280
 But this is to make it a little bit more in-depth and more robust, and especially including people

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.600
 to keep studying in the program that progresses over time in a sort of

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.400
 curriculum. So for the philosophy, the teachers will be people who are trained in the traditional

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.120
 institutions.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.430
 That means in the monastic Shraddhas, basically campus of people who have graduated from some of

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.400
 the Shraddhas.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.520
 It's not going to be me, for example, we're going to be teaching philosophy courses directly.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.920
 We're really trying to stay with the model of the line by line commentary on the Indian text.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:53.910
 And based on the Tibetan commentaries, for example, by teachers like Mipham, who has commentaries

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.360
 on most of the important texts of the Indian tradition.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.840
 That being said, it's not going to be purely based on the composite lecture.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.680
 Traditionally, there's a review class also in the Shraddha.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.400
 After students have been explained, they can come back and ask questions.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.200
 And so this is going to be a part of the program, also review class, but also more like contextual

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.280
 introductions.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.480
 In my experience, this is needed also for students who are taking the class.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.600
 It's useful to have more contextual presentation, more general introduction to some topics.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.880
 So we will have some of that also.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.050
 And that might be taught by people like myself, for example, or eventually some other faculty

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.560
 members.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.360
 As for the practicalities, the format.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.930
 We're trying to go based on advice of Kemporo Moche and based on sort of our experience, we're

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.800
 trying to go with a combination of

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.480
 both in-person and online teaching.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.320
 So the in-person part will take place in Pema Samilung Retreat Center.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.480
 We have wonderful facilities there.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.840
 And I think many of you are familiar with our retreat center.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.640
 We have a very big land with over 100 acres and natural space and quite contemplative environment

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.920
 and with the support of the local Sangha there.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.080
 And our goal is to not just be online and listening to lectures, but to really create a sense of

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.440
 community in the students

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.560
 and also the teachers.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:19.760
 And so it's not just this disembodied watching screens all the time, but we try to get to know each

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.800
 other and support each other

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.000
 in learning and studying.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.480
 And also, you know, especially that in-person interaction in that sense of being all together, we

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.400
 think is very important.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.880
 There are many online programs everywhere, but I think we think this this is very important for us

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.800
 to be able to progress.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.040
 So the in-person sessions at PSL, I think you've seen it on the website, will take place twice a

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.920
 year for the first three year batch of the program.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.520
 The first one will be in September, this coming September.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.120
 And the second one is in June.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.680
 So they're like in the beginning and end of the academic year, you could say.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.840
 And they last for four weeks each, so basically a month.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.040
 So students have to be ready to be in PSL for twice a year for a full month

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.560
 for that part of the program.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:16.800
 The time commitment for the program for this program, eventually we will try to expand and have a

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.000
 little bit more sort of slow paced

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.760
 kind of classes and sort of learning activities that people can do from home on a more casual basis

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:26.960
.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.600
 But for this program, it's very important that all aspects are required.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:39.680
 So we don't really want students to take only the in-person and not the online or only the online

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.760
 and not the in-person or only the philosophy and not the Tibetan.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.760
 For example, we're trying to really make a full curriculum that everybody takes.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.890
 So every student is progressing at a similar pace and then it's much easier also to teach because

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.800
 people have a similar level of understanding and progression.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:02.040
 So aspects of all the parts are required and they are compulsory.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.880
 The level of study is we also are trying to get.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:15.560
 It's going to be not just kind of beginning and casual, but people who want to take the study at N

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.920
ipam Institute should understand that this is an intensive program and there are classes every day.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.310
 And in the language course, for example, you have to be ready to keep up the pace and kind of learn

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:32.440
 and progress as we go, because if we really want students to progress and be able to read and read

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.280
 the satanas, read the commentaries slowly,

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.720
 become confident in that aspect over three years, it demands quite a level of commitment.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.870
 And so it's kind of an important thing for people to understand that this is quite a demanding kind

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.920
 of program.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.790
 We're not going to be completely traditional on this point and Tibet is extremely demanding and

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.440
 students who cannot follow usually would be kind of left out or kicked out or anything like that.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.590
 So we're not going to be so harsh on this, but people should understand that, yes, this is

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.480
 intensive and you have to be ready to really study basically full time while you're at PSL.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:13.960
 And even later on from the sessions at home, it's an ongoing program and it will be demanding.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.280
 While we're at PSL, there will be an intensive program, which is basically full time study.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.560
 So everyday philosophy class, everyday Tibetan and also review class.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.250
 So people have to kind of imagine those of you who went to university, similar to being in the full

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.880
 time program in university.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:38.020
 So you shouldn't expect like to do so many other things while you are living at PSL and you're

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.920
 doing the one month in person program.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:47.230
 We're trying to really use that time together to really get started and set up a very strong sort

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.960
 of momentum for our study.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.560
 So that would be a full time session.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.670
 Doing after the one month session at PSL, we'll have a break and then we'll start doing the online

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:03.520
 program and we'll be slightly less intensive here for the time commitment for the online.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.200
 There will be classes to take every day, every weekday.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.230
 Some of them will offer some degree of flexibility because we're hoping to have some pre-recorded

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.640
 lectures that people can take in their own time.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.520
 But there will also be some live sessions.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.440
 For example, the Tibetan language classes I hope to run as live sessions.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.960
 And these may not happen every day, but still it will be a significant commitment.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.480
 You can expect about three hours of live session, for example.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.520
 And with this kind of study, also, you should understand that similar to when you're taking

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.040
 university level classes.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.800
 It's not just about showing up to class.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.340
 When you learn a language, for example, there is a lot of time you do on your own at home, homework

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.480
, memorizing vocabulary, doing exercises and things like that.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.540
 And that is the same also that is true also for the philosophy class, where we also need to spend

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.930
 some time getting familiar with the material and making sure we identify all questions and so forth

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.320
.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:11.400
 For the format, of course, we're trying to be very close to the lineage sort of model.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.640
 But of course, we don't have every requirement that people were following in Tibet.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.440
 For example, in Tibet, it was really restricted to monastic communities.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.360
 So now, of course, we will also allow lay people.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.280
 This is more widely.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.040
 And in Tibet, for example, it was also restricted based on gender.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.880
 So, of course, we're not going to follow anything like that.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.360
 But still, we try to create a sense of being very places of intensive study where people really

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.320
 apply themselves and learn in an intensive way and that becomes your practice, so to speak.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.640
 So you're engaged in that in a very intensive way.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.400
 I think this is the last slide.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.520
 So regarding living at PSL, many of you are familiar already with the retreat center.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.440
 There are very good quality accommodations.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.390
 Those of you are already considering it in a practical way coming and don't know with PSL, there's

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.960
 a link on the program's page that explains how it works.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.800
 There are some private rooms available.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:18.580
 There are some shared dormitories, even like some smaller apartments, which I guarantee will be

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.080
 available, but I think to some extent will be OK.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.640
 So there are very good facilities and also you have access to the land.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.400
 That also means that you will have access to or be part of the community at PSL, which means, you

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.120
 know, there's everyday daily practice, different events on the main kind of days of the month, 10th

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.880
 day, 25th day, things like that.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.620
 There's often some other programs, sometimes kampura mochi also is teaching a little bit here and

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.200
 there.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.960
 There's other programs going on.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.240
 So this is all parts of the benefit of being at PSL.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.000
 Those of you who don't know, we're located in upstate New York.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.400
 The Catskills area, so it's beautiful natural environment as well.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.880
 There will also be usually there's meals prepared by local Sangha.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.290
 So the details are not all worked out, but there will be no basically ways to become part of the

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.840
 local community and so that you can also have all those facilities arranged for yourself.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.080
 There is also I'm sure the question will come up of that.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.760
 We have a local Sangha of people who don't live at PSL, but live in the area.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.420
 So that would be, of course, available as well. Those who are based locally can come in for class

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:25.840
 every day.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.320
 You don't have to stay at PSL itself, but the main part is to be there for all classes and learning

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.400
 activities.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:40.360
 So that is the overview really of the main points, which I'm not sure I really added much more from

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.360
 the website, but these are the main points.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.710
 And so now I would encourage you, like, if there is any question, any specific things you would

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:58.250
 like to ask, please, I think the easiest way is to type in the chat because we don't get lost into

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.720
 connecting mics and things like that.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.110
 So I would encourage you, if you have any question, like, please go ahead and we'll answer

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.920
 everything like one by one.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.960
 But that's the overview and I hope I didn't forget anything important. But, by the way, I'm Philip.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.340
 So I'm going to be doing some managing of the program, but also some of the teaching, especially

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.720
 the Tibetan language.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:33.140
 And also you can also see is also helping me with the running of the program, the administration

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.200
 and programming and she beautifully helped with the website and things like that.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.240
 So we're both kind of the members of the team now.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:46.220
 So just so introductions, but so I'll be answering most of the questions, if anything came up

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.520
 anything, OK, I see one here.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.840
 What would be the hours for the in-person?

00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.520
 I can't take a month of work, so hoping to work and take classes and what would be the hours for

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.200
 online.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.160
 OK, thanks for that question. That is very important.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.130
 As I just said a few minutes ago, for the in-person program at PSL is pretty much a full time

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.160
 commitment.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.570
 So if we have about an hour, an hour and a half of the philosophy course and then an hour and a

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.910
 half or so of Tibetan and review class and then plus with the study, it would be hard to keep

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.560
 working during that time.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.040
 For the online part of the program, we're trying to design it so people can keep a part time job,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.840
 for example, or maybe full time if they're really committed and they have a lot of energy.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:41.520
 But usually, for example, in the universities, we consider roughly in humanities, we had 15 hours

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.760
 of class was considered a full time load.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.920
 And for one hour of class, we usually expect about three hours of preparation outside.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.830
 So during the in-person session at PSL, it would be pretty much equivalent to a full time load, of

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:02.520
 course, as a college level for the online, more like part time.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.110
 But you still have to expect every day to have things to do and vocab to learn and homework and

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.440
 also participate in some live sessions.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:18.130
 So it does require some flexibility and commitment for those that time commitment who are

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.760
 interested.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.730
 We do have in the books the project of eventually starting a slower pace program where people

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.640
 studied similar approach and similar materials.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.910
 But maybe, you know, it's more like one day per week kind of thing or sessions and things like that

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.160
.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.280
 But our program is now we're trying to really focus on launching the main three year full kind of

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.760
 full hour cohort.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.440
 That's the main goal to really get it launched that way.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.240
 And the other programs hopefully will come a little bit after.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.630
 But there's been a lot of demands and I know it's hard for people to make the time unless you're

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.640
 retired or anything like that.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.360
 So we're going to be trying to make that available as well eventually.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.840
 So I hope that answers the first question.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.280
 Now I have a second one.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.280
 Marie was the first four week in person session is done.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.640
 How soon will the online sessions begin now?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.560
 Also, how many weeks online per semester?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.260
 Yes, good one. So the tentative plan now is to have after the end of September, having a two week

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.120
 break.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:30.480
 But two week break and then reconvene around mid October and the online program we're planning to

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.600
 run for.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.320
 I think it's eight weeks or maybe 10 weeks, something like that.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:45.560
 So it ends around early early mid December ish kind of time in around the 10th of December.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.760
 So but those are five days a week.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:54.600
 So weekends are off, but still it's happening on a daily basis for about 10 weeks.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.600
 When we go through these texts, for example, the kinds of literature we'll be studying or text like

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 Bodhi Charyavatarat,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.210
 entering the way of the Buddha, the letter to a friend by Nagarjuna, and eventually maybe we'll go

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.360
 into the philosophy.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.200
 It really takes some time to go line by line and the explanation of all the points.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.520
 And that's why we focus on that.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.320
 And for Tibetan also, really now we just don't want people to learn the alphabet and do a little

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.280
 bit and then come again.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.160
 We really want to take it to the level where you're comfortable and you're reading.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.360
 So that's the goal. So that's kind of the model.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.720
 And then after the December, the fall online session ends, there will be a break also.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.240
 And then we'll be reconvening pretty much like the end of February for 10 weeks again.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:50.860
 It takes us to early May about and then break and then live session at PSL in June, which June in

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.800
 PSL is a very nice time.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:26:02.080
 And also those of you. Yeah, that's it. I should stick to the question.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:10.700
 OK, thanks, Maria. I hope that answers. Can you expand on the aspirations for students who go

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.760
 through the program?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.880
 Yes, sure. Thank you for the question.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.040
 So we we're not going to be giving BA degrees, MA degrees and things like that.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:25.920
 Like we're not involved in that part, for example, unlike places like under the Institute in Nepal.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:34.600
 But we're trying to create basically a robust, robust program where when people completed and

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.980
 graduate, like they can say that we can know that they have a solid grasp of the philosophy of the

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.760
 view in the Tibetan as well.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:47.240
 So the aspiration is really to help foster further generation of people who can eventually,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.320
 hopefully pass on the teachings.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.240
 And we think it's very to the further generations.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.310
 And we think it's really important element of being able to continue the lineage to have that

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.120
 strong basis in the literature and in the teachings that we received from India and Tibet.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.040
 And so the aspirations is really similar to what we had in Tibet in Shaddas.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:14.880
 So to develop maybe not exactly using the titles and the certifications for lopin and campo, but as

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.040
 close as possible as we can get to that kind of certification of people where we know they have a

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.640
 solid grasp of the view.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.800
 They can explain it and they can also use the commentaries to support their own understanding and

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.960
 explanation.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:36.980
 And also, also have that in-depth knowledge of both languages contribute to making that

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:43.920
 transmission happen over the next.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.760
 And so traditionally in Tibetan Shaddas, people study, I mean, depending on the schools and the

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.560
 places from seven to thirteen years.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.490
 So we're hoping that people who complete the first three years, we might be able to run a second

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.040
 sort of more advanced session afterwards.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.000
 And probably at that time, we won't need to spend so much time learning Tibetan.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.060
 Hopefully, the Tibetan will be pretty good by then to really learn more about the view and

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:17.550
 eventually have people who are comfortable understanding the main elements of the teachings that we

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.320
 follow in our lineage, which are basically Madhyamaka philosophy.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:29.520
 Yoga Chara, Abhidhamma, and things like that. And some Buddhist logic and so forth.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:38.640
 So that's it. Thank you. OK, next one. I have some years of classical Tibetan.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.440
 But not much philosophical are the expectations for people's level of Tibetan at the start.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:50.680
 Yes, good question. That is one of the questions where I'm a little bit dealing with right now.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.960
 There are some students who might want to join, but already have some background in Tibetan.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.340
 So it's very important for us to make it available with people who have no background at all in

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.080
 Tibetan so that they can start from scratch.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.880
 Either we're going to be starting right from the beginning and learning the writing system and so

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.280
 forth, or maybe right after that.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.130
 So with the beginning of grammar and comprehension. But of course, based on who ends up taking the

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.160
 program, we'll also adapt our teaching to the level of students.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.640
 So already I have quite a few people who told me I have already some quite good Tibetan, will I be

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.080
 able to join and things like that.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:34.170
 So it's very possible based on who joins that we will have two different levels of Tibetan for a

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:39.710
 while in the beginning so that people who already have some background can continue from where they

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:40.120
're at.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.440
 And not just start right at the beginning level, but it's difficult now to know for sure without

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.880
 knowing who's there.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.010
 And so that's why those who seriously apply and want to join probably would be asking to meet you

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:56.920
 in person and get a bit more details about what kind of studies you've done in the past.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.160
 Maybe in the beginning we would be kind of doing different activities to where people are at in

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.680
 terms of their level of Tibetan and get started like that.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.680
 So, yeah, it's very likely that we'll have a sort of beginning class and more intermediate Tibetan,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:20.130
 but hopefully eventually then people can all be together and reading just directly and learning all

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.680
 together.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:31.350
 Yes. Thank you, Jenny, for the day to the precisely most specifically the days have been posted by

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.600
 Jenny in the chat if you want.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.560
 OK, next question. I was studying and looking at the website for the three year program.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:48.880
 I want to cover all aspects of Tibetan during three years.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.400
 Is the main aim of this course towards translation and publication of text?

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.880
 OK, I'll try to cover all of it. Yes, I think it's important to learn the scripts.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.720
 So probably we'll be doing that as well.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.740
 It's kind of I this is my personal view, but I consider that is kind of a weakness of the way

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:13.690
 Tibetan is taught in many universities, for example, without learning who may and accursive scripts

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:14.000
.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.200
 It's usually something you can learn very quickly when you have Tibetan like in the weekend.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.160
 But some even like some people at advanced levels in universities don't learn it.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.680
 So, yeah, yeah, we'll learn that at some point.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.680
 But the goal is the main course towards translation and publication of text.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:36.300
 I would say to that, no, the translation is an art in itself, and it involves, in my experience, as

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.730
 much work working with how to express express things in the destination language as well as

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.240
 understanding of the literature.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.930
 And there are existing programs for that, and that's really not our main goal to train students to

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.160
 become translators.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.800
 We really will be focusing more on developing an in-depth understanding of text that for the most

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.600
 part are already translated.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.640
 And, of course, that can be an item that would be very useful for people who want to do translation

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.280
 in the future, but it's not a translator training program, per se.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:14.810
 That's not the main goal of this program is more a scholar practitioner program for people who want

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:22.200
 to practice and apply understanding of the of the view to their own contemplative practice.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:32.050
 Thanks for the question, Dario. Another question, is there any possibility to focus mostly on the

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.160
 Tibetan?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:40.800
 So I think that would mean study only take only the Tibetan program and not the philosophy.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.520
 Or maybe take the philosophy, but not focus so much on it.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:52.500
 Yeah, as I said, our priority or what we would really like is to create a community of students who

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.320
 all study the same material together at the same time.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.630
 But that being said, especially for the live person, there may be people who want to take only the

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:06.160
 Tibetan.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:13.000
 Good question. I mean, I'm not I'm not sure, really. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Maybe that could be

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.720
 possible.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:21.320
 I think we'll have to discuss this. We have to see. I'm not completely against it, but at the same

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.240
 time.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:29.080
 So let me say I'll consider this. I consider this. But I don't want to guarantee right now.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.880
 It's something I've been thinking about. But I really would like to encourage people to take the

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.760
 whole thing.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.030
 But if they want to take only the Tibetan, if it doesn't interfere with any rest, it might be

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:40.720
 possible.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:48.110
 So let me think and get back to you about that. That's OK, Garland and Nancy, whoever you ask that

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.640
 question.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.720
 Since is Nancy. OK, thanks.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.960
 Any other question? I see there is a question being written right now.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.600
 I'll wait a bit.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:29.120
 The OK question about the costs and expenses in the Web site, the cost indicated in the Web site

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.200
 for the three year.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:38.950
 OK, the the cost per program, which is I think three thousand eight hundred fifty dollars per year.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.760
 Get to cover the teaching fees.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.440
 So we do have support for the programs and generously from my family foundation.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.280
 But we also have costs running it and we sort of want to keep the program rolling.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.110
 And also we do we are generously hosted by PSL, but we also don't want to be a burden like

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.840
 financially on the center.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.680
 So that's why we have the cost as they are.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.370
 As we said on the Web site, though, you know, if it's really a problem for people, we can talk

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:08.920
 about it.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.000
 And there are ways we're developing program for a scholarship or to help people cover those fees

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.640
 when if you're really not able to do that.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:32.200
 And also there's something which we ourselves as the MIPAM Institute will not be going to be able

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.960
 to remove is like the cause for living accommodations at Pema Samili.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.410
 Because, you know, somebody has to cover that, but we're trying to keep it as low as possible and

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.600
 so not to be prohibitive in any way.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:50.240
 And I think for the amount of hours and teaching you get, we're trying to keep it reasonable.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.120
 So if the program cost itself is a problem, we can you can be in touch and we can talk about it.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.180
 There's also some we had some generous donations to support people who want to take it, but don't

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.600
 have the needs.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.920
 But that's for the one year.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.800
 Can one pay for one semester or no need and then for another?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.760
 Yeah, I'm sure we can have some flexibility regarding the payments like twice a year or something

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.520
 like that.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:24.930
 That will be possible. And, yeah, I think regarding reimbursing fees and things like that, we haven

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.870
't worked all of these details out, but I would think like maybe per semester, I mean, or per

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.800
 semester or.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.040
 Per half year, roughly would be the way it would be processing the payments.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.840
 And so if somebody needs to leave, for example, they would not be responsible for the cost of the

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.680
 whole program in advance.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.840
 We could work on something like that.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.840
 Thank you. OK, another question from Emma.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:59.640
 A question on behalf of a friend with the program makes sense for some without much background in

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.360
 the Dharma.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.680
 Is the aim towards established practitioners?

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.870
 We really want to make it accessible for people who don't have a lot of prior study of those

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.840
 materials.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:16.900
 But at the same time, just from hearing from the people who are interested in joining, most people

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.200
 already have a quite good background in Buddhist practice.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.240
 So it will be made available really for people who don't have a strong background.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.030
 And we will in that case, we will have things like recommended readings to help people get prepared

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.320
 to be able to follow.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.360
 But really, no, you don't need any kind of big background.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.000
 Of course, it would be more work for somebody who is not familiar at all with Buddhism.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.550
 And it's a big commitment in time and so forth for people, somebody who doesn't really know what

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.040
 Buddhist thought is about.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:53.950
 But we're trying to make it available for people without any kind of formal requirements to begin

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.760
 with.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.880
 Thank you. Another question.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.280
 Thanks to Jenny. Is this program for students of any school of Tibetan Buddhism?

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.760
 Yes. Of course, everybody is welcome. Students should know, though, that, yeah, we are a Buddhist

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.640
 center and this is a Buddhist program.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.800
 And so is like that. That is the kind of our bias. We're not hiding that.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.190
 We're trying to study the teachings as something to apply in our lives based on the lineage and

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.120
 based on our teachers instruction.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:28.010
 So, yes, like it's not. But of course, there are different ways of being committed to Dharma

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.240
 communities in Buddhist teaching.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.200
 So we're not going to be testing any sort of things that people kind of preferences people have.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.440
 But regarding any school of Tibetan Buddhism, yes, everybody is welcome.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:48.560
 Now, we don't hide that our main sort of connection with Tibetan images is through the Nyingma

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.480
 school, through BBC, through our teachers.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:57.280
 And that also will be reflected in the kind of commentaries we study, for example, mostly written

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.200
 by Nyingma authors such as Mipham Rinpoche.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:06.990
 And people like that. But that being said, is the main materials, the Indian treatises are common

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.160
 to all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.600
 And so if people come from a slightly different school, there's really no problem.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.000
 And that's really no problem at all for us. Like everybody is really welcome.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.920
 And of course, you won't be required to follow any sort of orthodoxy or follow any of you.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.960
 The approach is really open ended inquiry. But that being said, yes, it is kind of based on the N

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.880
yingma school.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.690
 But yeah, nothing is required in terms of being committed to any lineage or school or anything like

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:36.280
 that.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.590
 It's really open for everybody. And the Tibetan language is the same for all Tibetans, like all the

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:48.560
 Tibetan Turkey, Tibetan classical Tibetan is the same.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:56.010
 That's it. And our approach is really to be as much as possible non-sectarian, to treat all the

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.640
 Buddha's teachings as fit instructions.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:05.480
 And to welcome any sort of question or inquiry. And that includes also is traditional also in the

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:12.320
 Tibetan system to sort of consider the different interpretations made by other schools.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.120
 When we go in depth into study, that happens whether you want it or not.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.760
 So it's not going to be restricted in any way to only Nyingma or anything like that.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:28.400
 And of course, our approach is a little bit more traditional. But what is very important for me is

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.360
 to not just treat that as kind of ideas in the museum of the history of ideas,

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.600
 but really develop our own understanding based on our current world.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:46.150
 And there's some work of translating to the other language we are familiar with, really developing

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.680
 our understanding each for ourselves.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.710
 And the goal is not just to learn the orthodox view. The goal is to be able to develop our own

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.880
 understanding, to apply to our own life, our own practice.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.280
 And that means that the questions that come up are not all in the Indian treatises.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:12.210
 So we keep it alive as a live study. And so in that sense, yeah, there will be a lot of open

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:18.360
 approach to all kinds of questions that people may have based on their own background.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:27.210
 Thank you. Okay. Regarding applications, is there a separate form? So far, we're just going with

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.120
 applications through email.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:34.680
 So you can send us an email. There's an address, applications@miphaminstitute.org.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:42.190
 And now we're asking CV and a short statement and two references really is just to help us

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.040
 understand know you better.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:51.200
 And so we also want to make sure that people join like are in good conditions to be kind of have a

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.920
 successful experience going through the program.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.560
 And that's really why we're asking for those materials. But just as email is fine.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:07.150
 And I would like to say, like, it's very possible that we may ask to meet in person for a short

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.950
 time just to make sure, you know, that we're on the right page and get to know you and you get to

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:12.400
 know us.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:17.330
 And maybe you have people have more questions. But so far, yeah, you can just send it as an email

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:24.790
 and we'll go through those and probably get back to you very soon and then get a final approval in

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.800
 early April.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:34.000
 What's the date? I think 15th of April, I think something like that.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.480
 OK, is there any idea yet on the time of day for online daily classes?

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.080
 OK, that's good. Getting into the details.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:55.520
 This is not set yet, but I would probably imagine that we would have.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:02.600
 As I said, one of the one we go online, there will be some prerecorded sessions that people can

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.840
 take at their own convenience.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:11.500
 When we're at PSL, it will be probably both morning and afternoon sessions, but no early morning

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.680
 and no night.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:18.480
 Although I haven't considered that if that is if that were to make life easier for people who are

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.000
 doing the online programs, I could consider that.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.270
 That's the kind of thing, for example, you could write us about and say during the online session,

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:31.560
 it would be better for me to take the live session later on in a day or something like that.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:37.480
 We can consider that it really depends on how many students we have and where they are located.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:45.010
 There's an issue also sometimes with time zones. People who may live in other areas, whether on the

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.800
 West Coast or even in other continents.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:53.280
 So I don't want to set it now before we know who is there and how it's going to work.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:44:00.420
 But probably, I mean, we could do something, for example, like trying to keep classes within the

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.720
 before lunch.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.240
 So if somebody has a part time job, they can work in the afternoon or something like that, but it

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.080
 is not set yet.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.640
 But we will have some flexibility with that.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.940
 But I think we'll wait and see who's joining and what their needs are and we'll try to be flexible

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.080
 and accommodate people there.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:23.520
 Me, I prefer morning classes because afternoon is not that good, but we can also do that.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:35.520
 We'll see. OK, yeah, if for applications, there's a link to our page there.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:45.760
 OK, another question, diploma or degree.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.150
 OK, so, yes, we're hoping that people who complete the three year program will be giving some

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.720
 formal recognition.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.040
 But that would be a statement from the institute.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:02.320
 There will not be any formal academic degree recognized by the US government or anything like that,

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:09.640
 because we're just not going to get into those administrative sides of things for a while, I think.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:16.610
 That being said, it's possible, I think, after a while, that universities, for example, might

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:20.120
 recognize our courses as prior study.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:28.800
 And that could help you to sort of establish prerequisites for some courses, for example, in

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.120
 Tibetan.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:35.160
 We're just starting. So as you probably understand, this has not been set up yet.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:42.280
 But, yeah, although we're not ourselves trying to develop university types of programs and degrees,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:49.040
 I'm very happy and open to have good collaboration with existing universities and things like that.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.560
 And it's possible maybe even people from other places might want to join eventually.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.560
 So hopefully, yes, there will be some sort of recognition.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:00.400
 But I can't really speak on behalf of the universities and whether they will recognize what we do.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:06.240
 But my aim and my background is teaching Tibetan at university, in university programs.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:12.270
 I started teaching at McGill in 2008 and then here at the Nepal at Rangjungishi Institute during

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.720
 the 2010s.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:21.320
 And that would be our approach is to have as rigorous or maybe even more rigorous in the university

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.160
 and to develop very, very strong knowledge of the language.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:31.800
 And usually universities are pretty good at recognizing that by testing, like prior levels of study

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.880
 and things like that.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.920
 But probably not formally in purely academic terms.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:42.160
 But you will be recognized with certificates and things like that.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.440
 Regarding certificates for partial completion of the program.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.560
 Yeah, we haven't worked those details out yet.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.840
 I think you can definitely get a letter saying you did one year or two years of MIPAM Institute.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:01.440
 But I think regarding the certificate of completion of the course, the focus will be on completing

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.280
 the whole three year program at this point.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:11.300
 Well, we've already been over an hour, but I'm happy to state because there are still questions

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:11.760
 coming up.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.960
 So, of course, feel free if you have something else to do or need to go.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.320
 But I'm happy to keep answering questions.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.160
 OK, should we email contact at MIPAM Institute?

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.080
 Yes, you should email us as much as you'd like.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.400
 For any general questions, we have contact at MIPAM Institute for admissions.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.160
 Please use the link or send to admissions at MIPAM Institute.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.920
 This just helps us here internally, like keeping track of applications and things like that.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.560
 But yeah, those addresses work.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.600
 Definitely. And we're a small team now, so we basically see everything.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.520
 You can email to us at contact.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:58.120
 And for admissions, if possible, please use the admissions email address.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.880
 And for any questions, really, don't be shy.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.280
 You can just email us.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:11.580
 It's much more useful for us to know specific questions than trying to guess what we would need to

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.000
 know.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.360
 So, it looks like there are no further questions.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.560
 Was this useful?

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.040
 Yes.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.160
 Thank you.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.560
 Yes, OK.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560
 Good.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.560
 I'm happy.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560
 This was useful.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.560
 So, is anybody seriously considering joining?

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.560
 I mean, some of you do because you already sent an application, things like that.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.560
 But yeah, don't be shy. Get in touch with us.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.560
 And we can meet also in person if you have any further questions.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.560
 But it's new and we're moving a little bit fast.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.560
 But yeah, we're launching it.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:01.560
 And I hope some of you will join us next fall at PSL.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:11.630
 And we start, I think, Kenpo Morumachi is sort of what he told us is that, yeah, this can really be

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:15.560
 something important for the transmission of Dharma teachings in the West.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:20.760
 And he emphasized also that this was really part of Kenmo, Kenmochi Kenchampadenshe that I was

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.560
 vision to eventually I have Shetra at PBC.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.120
 I mean, just in the US and the West in general, especially at PBC, as you know, Kenmochi himself

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.560
 was a great practitioner.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.560
 But also very versed in the philosophy and language grammar and all of that.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.560
 And we're trying to honor that vision and to maintain it and pursue it.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:49.240
 And we hope to open the door for this aspect of transmission of Dharma to be established in the

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.560
 West, in the US, in North America.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.560
 So it's a big vision.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:59.560
 In our small way, we're trying to do a kind of small step for that big vision.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.560
 So I'm really happy to see that there's interest and also a shared interest for that program.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.560
 So thanks for joining and thanks for your interest.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:16.560
 And I hope we can talk about it more and we can eventually maybe meet in person and you can join us

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:16.560
.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.560
 And that we all learn together more.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.560
 Thanks, Philippe. And the website is beautiful.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.560
 Thank you. Thank you.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.560
 Thank you, Charlie.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.560
 A lot of artwork from my family.
