00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.990
 Thank you everyone. Thank you everyone. We will talk again now. Again resume or talk, go through

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.000
 the teaching by the Japanese, the New languages. And this is the New languages teaching.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 What we're going to do is the essential teachings of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. How

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 to put that into practice? More simple, more easy, more accurate.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.250
 That's so good. We have some good realizations in this lifetime. That will be continually benefited

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.000
, bright up our destinations to come.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.580
 So that's what really we're going through this all, that one kind of going to create you slowly by

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.000
 slowly to activate our knowledge and understanding of the dharma.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 Then we will resume to culminate, create the mask as one up another and as well as also we read

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 books so much.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.580
 So all those kind of trying to really kind of reactivate it, trying to burn on the spotlight so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 that we really benefited to ourself. We will bring joy, peace, happiness, and support ourself.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.240
 Also some really that energy where we got joy, peace, happiness, some realization benefited to the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 others. So that is what it is all about.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.250
 And now again to do this, according to teaching, always to mention and so we will extend our

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.000
 motivation again.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.830
 Why I'm talking all-time motivation? Because this is really what teaching is best upon the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.000
 motivation.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 In time, Buddha's teachings of the nine jnana teachings, all idi-portonous teachings are to purify

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.000
 our obscuration of the mind.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 All wide negative mind, transcendent and bring the ordinary, any nature of the mind.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.420
 Mind, peace, happiness, loving-kindness. When our mind is become in that beautiful status, it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.000
 naturally affects our verbal communications.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:51.430
 Our verbal communication will become gentle, peaceful, and also immediately affect our physical

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 activities. Our physical activities will become more gentle, more peaceful, more appealing, more

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 counter-active, beneficial, and politeness.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 All those really will come. So easily beautiful. That's why great teachers, Buddha summarized the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:11.760
 entire teaching, said, "Suryu all the negative ideas and perform all the positive activities or

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.000
 virtues, discipline on its own mind."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 This is Buddha teaching. Oh, this is my teaching. That's what great teachers said.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.530
 Discipline on one's own mind, what we're going to discipline, we're going to discipline our wide

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.000
 neurotic, that unbeneficial thought.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.140
 They're going to discipline. They're going to subdue. And now to do that, the teaching, follow with

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.000
 the teaching of the Buddha Chaturmani is excellent.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.620
 There's no better solutions, better alternatives taught by any other great masters to end the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.000
 Buddha's teaching.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.100
 It's really wonderful. It's gentle, peaceful, appealing. It touches our core of our heart, our own

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.000
 nature.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.870
 It's explaining our nature, our beauty. That is all about it. So therefore, for that reason, we

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.000
 really follow it. That's what we practice.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.080
 We're not just practicing, we're not just leaving that intellectual status, we're observing that in

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.000
 our heart, activating that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.580
 So that we'll be radiating through our, as I said, hearing, through the mind, through the speech,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 through the body. That is what it is.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.700
 So therefore, again, this is our beautiful motivation of the joy and the appreciations. Life is

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.000
 precious. Life is so special.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.290
 We're here, short times, in a way. In a way, 100 years, what? 60 years, 40 years, 30 years, 20

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.000
 years, whatever it is.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.430
 We're here, in a way, in a kind of long period of the century, all those things of that, our life

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.000
 span is really not too long.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 At that time, we're trying to really bring some good result in our self.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.090
 And therefore, again, bring joy and appreciation. Bring more joy, you know, appreciation is our

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.000
 situation, the sound of blessing.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And which is done, which is essence of the one of practices.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And then, to get with it, bodhictham, vastness, motivation of the bodhictham for all living beings.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 That's what the teachings say. And that is what we're going through.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And then, purely, realization of the wedding and the teaching.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 So those all beautiful motivation, intention, that is our foundation.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.280
 From that foundation, we're going to build up, reactivate, re-glorify that motivation, is the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.000
 practices.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 That is what we're really going to do.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And again, to do that, and when we went through this, I said,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 don't know, we teach teaching through this.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 The Japanese Union was teaching, we discussed about that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Started with the poor. They don't second thoughts. We discussed.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 That is the essence of the teachings of the great city of Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 first true, noble truth, teaching.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Cause of suffering truth, suffering truth.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 That is basically, it is really the essence of that.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 How to bring that again.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That is nothing mystery, is nothing kind of like any extra ordinary,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 or is it kind of like something secret of Buddhist domas or anything.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 It's the way things are.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 That is, and these four renowned second thoughts are, again, break life.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 It's so precious. That reflecting on them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 This, also, this renowned second thought is all great tools of the mindfulness practices.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Mindfulness efforts.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 But looking outside all the time, we look into our own best foundation,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 our own home where we are.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Really, and break, so we don't ignore our break life.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And therefore, great teacher, brother told, break life.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Life is so important, precious.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 It's weaker to cross the ocean of samsara,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 or it's a fundamental tool to bring some good developments.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So therefore, well, body is here.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Life is here. It's so special, so beautiful.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 That is the way this body is like temple.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 It's a shrine of the divine mandalas.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 It's so special.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 That divine mandalas is with us.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 How precious. How beautiful.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And we really use this mandala.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 We really can activate it in not just the body, only our body mandala.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 The entire universe can really become the mandala of the Buddha as it is said.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 The next one is for renowned second thought, as we all know, in parmana.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 If parmana is changing, again reflecting on that, not naively ignoring that,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 but looking to that in parmana is very true.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 It's true. It's changing. We know.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 It's changing all the time, constantly.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So when we reflect in parmana, what is in the teaching?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 It will bring our minds more gentle, more peaceful, more practical.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 We will become more wise to use the tiles, not restless tiles.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And that is what it is, reflecting on in parmana.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Again, if we reflect on the mind, when in parmana is a very, very powerful mindfulness practice.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 It brings us more to the center, not skater. It will bring.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And then bring to the center.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 The next one is for renowned second thought, as we all know.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Cause and effects are inevitable, which are also known as karma.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 This is true. Externally, everything is exactly the way things are.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Cause and conditions, and that break the result.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And similarly, our mantras are really the same.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So, again, put more mind for us.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So our activities become more mindful, more gentle, more peaceful, more meaningful, more practical.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 It really will help.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And therefore, reflecting on the law of the karma, or cause and effects.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 The next one is the fourth one, which is samsara as it are, difficult, challenging.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Because it's changing. It is moving. It's not stable all the time.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 One after another. Change is not bad, because that's what we can improve.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 But it is always like, most of the roller coasters, ups and don'ts, and all that.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And then our feelings, our intentions, our desires, not always matching those things.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 What change comes, and then we, in a way, crushed with that.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Because what we expected, what is happening, naturally, and then it becomes uncomfortable.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 So reflecting that, and what it does, it will does.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 It will broaden our mind, more open mind, more relaxed mind.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Let it come. Let it go.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Are we going to continue going to serve, suffering on these waves of the change of life?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 That is what really identity and the principle of the practitioners.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 That's what we went through.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 And then we talk about the references.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 That is the foundation of the Buddha teaching, rafuj.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 We discussed that going to rafuj.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 One way to help the rafuj is the primary purpose of the cause of rafuj in the Mahayana.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 It is compassion.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Because I like to help all the sentient beings, and remove their suffering, their difficulty,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 trouble.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Therefore, I like to check rafuj and get help, activated by standing,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 so that I can help to all the beings from the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, Dharma teachings.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So that's really, in the teachings, primary cause of checking rafuj,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 according to Mahayana, is compassion.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Once we talk to rafuj, then we discuss about the bodhicadai.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Bodhicadai is a very, very special teaching of the Mahayana.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Generally, the entire Buddha teaching is best upon compassion.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Best upon loving kindness.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 But Mahayana is emphasizing on the compassion and bodhicadai.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 That is, in Mahayana, again bodhicadai, we discussed.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And bodhicadai can be a different kind of way to divisions or different durations.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 We summarize according to teaching two bodhicadas, wishing bodhicadai and actualizing bodhicadai.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 When there is wishing bodhicadai, when there is actualizing bodhicadai,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 it is compassion, it is loving kindness, it is a wisdom.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 That is all that is important.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 There is no difference.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And first, when things develop in bodhicadai, then there is truth.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Wishing bodhicadai comes first, and as wishing bodhicadai comes first,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 and as keep that attitude of that wishing bodhicadai,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 and then we activate the bodhicadai, which is actualizing bodhicadai.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 So, wishing bodhicadai is, again, the highlight of the pole boundless.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 That we went through and you all know pole boundless.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 This pole boundless, again, this bodhicadai is a coordinated teaching of the Buddha,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 in particular Mahayana, in the Vedicana teaching.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Bodhicadai is nature of the mind.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 It is really nature. It is one's own organic nature of the mind.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 The nature of the mind is emptiness. The nature of the mind is loving kindness.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 The nature of the mind is compassion.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 It is blended in, targeted without any expressions.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 It is, therefore, many times in the teaching, mentioned unions.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 So that is what.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And that is extended in the Mahayana, pole boundless.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Without any borders, boundless love, boundless compassion, boundless joy,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 and boundless equanimities. Without any borders.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 When the Sittling College of that very fresh in the heart of the mind,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 then, together with that, we do the tundi practices.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Those are the equalizing and the tundi, and others are even more important than ourselves.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Those are teaching. Those are the exercise, mentally exercised.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Once we have the Sittling College of the pole boundless,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 then you put that in a mental exercise.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And the tundi practice, commonly, I think it is quite very popular in Western,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 particularly those Western, the very best practice, tundi practice.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Tundi means sending the happiness and peace and joy,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 taking in the difficult troubles of the sentient beings.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Those are known as tundi, but tundi has three.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 First is equalizing.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Praying everyone is equal, that equal talk.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 We all equal, really equal, feeling level equal,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 design level equal, and as well as our convalescent.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Where we are is equal, or where we are best, where we are saying is equal,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 what we are is equal, what we share is equal.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 There is no really difference at all.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 So this is true.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 I found that true, that's true.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Passes.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Once you got that, again, I will do that, and then do the tundi practice.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Tundi, exchanging, tundi, exchanging, as I said earlier.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Once you got those things of you, it's not something that you have to do that,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 that you can do ultimately that too.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 But then, the most important, others are more important than ourselves.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 So that is known as tundi practices.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Those all are teaching, measured as part of the wishing bodhicitta practices.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Now this wishing bodhicitta practices, then you come to the actualizing bodhicitta.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 When you come to the actualizing bodhicitta,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 then you can do also these tundi practices as well as the pole boneless practices.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.410
 The actualizing bodhicitta is what is generally the activity of the bodhisattvas, is the actual

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.000
izing bodhicitta.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And these bodhisattvas are activated in the teaching.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 It is said, there is origin of the activity of the bodhisattvas.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 There is so many, but summarize that all activated, the beneficial activated,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 all the sentient beings are summarized into these six paramanas, six paramanas.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 That is entirely Mahayana teaching.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Teaching in the teaching said can be, or practices can summarize in the six paramanas.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And the six paramana can summarize into three extraordinary teachings, as I said.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.350
 Morality, as I said, but this is the teaching said, it's not just I'm saying that, and you all know

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.000
 that.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 The morality, extraordinary practices, concentration, extraordinary ordinary practices,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 and the wisdom, extraordinary ordinary practices.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Those are the three, labhasam or labhasam in the Vedic said, but it is six paramanas in that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 It is more condense in the Vedic way. And more, when we do the six paramana practices,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 or three extraordinary practices, training practice, what is us?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 In the kind of essence level, kind of summarized level, it will purify two obscurations.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 It will accumulate, reactivate, re-energizing the two meanings, two meanings.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Purify the two obscurations, and those two obscurations,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 whenever you already know, the emotion obscurations, that connected with ego clinkings,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 and all this active growth, negative emotions, those are the emotion obscurations.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And then knowledge obscurations. Knowledge obscurations is subtle obscurations.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Subtle obscurations, in a way, bears of the emotion obscurations.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Bears, or foundation of the emotion obscurations, in a way, is subtle.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And that is what in the teaching said, grasping, clinging, clinging to the subject,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 clinging to the object, clinging to the activities.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Those are known as knowledge obscurations.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 So this two parameters of six paramana, it will clear that way.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Clear that way, and it will increase in the two merits.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Accumulation merit versus the merits.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Accumulation merit can be, for example,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 post-three parameters are mainly accumulation merits,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.500
 which is generously parameter, and as well as morality parameter, patient parameters are

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.000
 accumulation merits.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And the last two is concentration parameter versus the parameters are known as versatile merits.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 And joyful effort parameter is support for all of parameters or both parameters.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So, both accumulation practices. So that is brilliant, isn't it?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 When we are accumulating to merit, what is brain?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 It brings our final realization, final, our discovery, our final, all the natures.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And what is natures? In the teaching said, it will bring the achievement of the two guys, two guys.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 And again, we discussed that earlier when we were talking about taking refuge.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.700
 Taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha, we went through briefly about the Buddha's and Kaya

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.000
's.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And that two Kaya's are known as Dharma Kaya and Rupa Kaya's.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 These are two Kaya's.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 For example, this accumulation merits will bring the main result of the Rupa Kaya's.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Accumulation merits will bring the achievement of Rupa Kaya's.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Worst merits will be the achievement of Dharma Kaya's. That is just highlighted. The reality of

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 those, of course, these two Kaya's,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 or two merits are not different from each other, big different from each other.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And also in the airport, also two Kaya's are not different big from each other.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Dharma Kaya and Rupa Kaya is one nature with many different aspects or many different emanations.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So Rupa Kaya is the result of the practice of the Accumulation melee.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And Dharma Kaya's discolourment is mainly the practice of the worst merits.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 And so that is a brilliant understanding.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.340
 Again, just a highlight of that one we went through, through it last time, and just remind everyone

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.000
 again.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.270
 And now, even those thought we are discussing, talking and following the teaching of Rupa Kaya and

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.000
 Rupa Kaya,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.230
 we are talking about now, again, among the two bodhisattas, we are talking about the actualizing

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.000
 bodhisattas.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 The actualizing bodhisattas, again, six paramatas, come back to six paramatas.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 And those six paramatas, again, are just a list of those we all know, you all know them.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 At least we all know the names, I shouldn't say we all know them.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Those are very deep and profound, and it is just that.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But this is just a little terminology that we know.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.490
 And it's by the kindness, the gracious light of us by the Buddhas and all great masters, so we know

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.000
 those.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:46.870
 And so the list of the names of the six paramatas, first is a generous paramata, and the second is

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.000
 morality paramata,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.130
 and the third is a gracious paramata, and the fourth is a joyful effort paramata, and the fifth is

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.000
 concentration paramata.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And sixth is the worst paramatas. Those are six paramatas.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.840
 These six paramatas are, again, the essence of the practice of the entire bodhisattvas, all the bod

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.000
hisattvas.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 When you talk about the vows of the bodhisattva, what do we do?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.990
 We then practice of the six paramatas. That's what we discussed, or we went through a court of

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.000
 teaching.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 And then there are certain paramatas, each of those paramatas can be divided into many, I mean,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 that.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Each of those all can be divided into six paramatas.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 We then, each paramata can contain six of those, each of those.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And that way, in the teaching said, the 36 paramatas.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 So that means the generous paramata has six paramatas of generousness.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And morality has six, and six, six, six. So 36, all tokens.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.600
 But then to summarize that, again, to kind of more similar, easy to get, and then paramata, each of

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.000
 those divided into three.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.400
 Three. That means generously divided into, or subjubation three, and morality three, and so forth

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.000
 like that.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And so in that way, we went through the first generous paramata, we went through those.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Generous paramata even divided for the more, not just three, for the more divided.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 For example, material generosity paramata, we divided, I mean, not me, in the teaching.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Teaching said three of those.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Small material generosity, medium material generosity, and very enormous material generosity.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 So even material generosity divided into three.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And that way, then it really makes even the five or six generosity paramata practice.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Those are where we really went last time, last time.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 And you remember, and I'm sure you all know in the books and all that.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And also the great master's teachings, so that's it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And so now, up we went through.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 So now we went, that means we went through the generousness.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And now we go still with morality paramatas.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And we discussed that the last time, time and morality paramata is divided into three.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And those are known as the morality that will avoid all the negativities,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 directly in, directly small or small, medium or big.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Whatever that is, avoiding that negativity, that is known as morality.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 That's morality that avoided all negativities.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Whether it's a big one, whether it's a small one, whether it's a medium one, directly, indirectly.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 That is first morality.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Second morality, gathering all the virtues.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Virtues, virtues, big, small, medium, whatever it is, directly, indirectly,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 and currently intends to do, and on that mood, when we keep that attitude and do that,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 that is known as the morality of the gathering of all the virtues.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And the third one, morality is known as morality that will,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 performing all the beneficial activities.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Big, small, medium, or whatever, for all the beings.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And so that is three moralities.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Again, as I said already, we are all reminded to each, all of you ask.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 You and me, all of us, morality, or this sixth paramata is absolutely best upon the full bonus.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Absolutely.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 It is, whether it's morality, whether it's generosity, whether it's energy,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 is all best upon the full bonus.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Also simple by it's best upon both each other, of the loving kindness of completion and versus.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 That is really something, that's it, it is.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 So now, morality, we've got the teaching that avoiding all the negative activities,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 big and small or medium, that is morality.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Again, best upon loving kindness, completion and versus.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And that is, and so we went that last time.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Again, we shouldn't think, oh, morality, that have to avoid all the negative activities.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Negative activities is kind of big and huge and so kind of difficult, we should not think that.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 It is simple.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 It started simple way, simple way to activate that.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 It's all our intentions, it's all our mindfulness, mindful with the compassion.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 For example, in the teaching set, for example, how that is.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 For example, we made soman.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Soman and you had sudden discussions and beginning, we started, looks like we're going to argue,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 fight or argue, let's say argue.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Moment our voice has become kind of stronger or become louder, something,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 that practice, both of these are the practices, immediately called that.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Oh, oh, why am I raising my voice?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 I should not do this.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 I'm body, body, I talk body to the ones.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 I shouldn't do, it's not good.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 That thought, that attitude, that mentality is a word in negative activities.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 That is negative activity, you stop that.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 You stop right there.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 We've been good boys and girls every day.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 That moment, you feel happy.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Happy, I kept my, by my mindfulness, I caught that and I immediately released, I stopped it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Happy, and happy that.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And maybe we can say some words such as excuse, sorry, I said that.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Those things, oh, sorry that happened, something like that.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 That is performing the virtues, gathering the virtues.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 That you gather the virtues.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 That is virtues.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 You pacify that situation.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Whatever is going to activate it, you pacify it.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 In the mind, you really caught that with your mindfulness and stop that.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 That is stopping the negative activities.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 At the same time, you kind of highlight some of your politeness, or nice gentle more.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 That is performing the beneficial.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 At the same time, it is gathering the virtues.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.710
 And more than that, in the teachings, ever you had a mindfulness that time, did you get that merits

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.000
?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 You did something really good, I did something good.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 I am happy in your, and I wish, may I be able to do that more again in future.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 And whatever the energy merit, it came, I did again that for all the sentient beings.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 That is also known as in the teachings it is, benefit, performing the beneficial activities.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 All the sentient beings.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 So therefore, this and this, I mean, generally this kind of, this is not something that,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.340
 again the things we can do, it is just practical, being practical, being thoughtful, with

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.000
 mindfulness,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 as the more gradually, gradually move that.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 And then big things, and even medium things, whatever we can do is wonderful.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Great.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Every time in the heart, in the joy, joy, and dedicated that merit for all the sentient beings,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 whatever we can do.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 That is known as, known as they, is, they are all the morality.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Everything comes with that status.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Negative.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Stop with morality, that stops all the negativities.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Morality that will perform with all the positive activities.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 And benefit, morality that benefit for all the sentient beings.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Really all came there.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 So that is generally the kind of understanding of these moralities.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Now, as I said the other day, or the last time, this, performing all the morality,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.330
 that will perform all the positive activities, or dharma activities, that encompass entire

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.000
 practices.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Entire of these teachings, practices.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 For example, all this from here.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Devotee union is teaching, from all this, from anyone till end, it is all.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 All it encompasses entirely, entirely like virtualizations, complete stages, very inner teachings.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 It encompasses the entire chakrutta chanas, chamata meditations, all that really it encompasses.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 And this morality, this performance, gathering all the virtuous activities, also it encompasses

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 all the six paramatas, practices.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 All the six paramatas practices.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Generally, morality is, according to the teaching stage, is the foundation of all the practices.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 For that reason, great master.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Nagarojuna said, morality is the earth.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 It's the foundation.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Earth is the foundation of everything, whether it moves or whether it don't move.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Everything is best on earth.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Similarly, morality is the best of the entirely realization of the nirvana.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 All realization of the enlightenment is the best of all moralities.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 So therefore, this performing all, gathering all the virtuous activities,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 that encompasses entirely the teachings or practices of the Buddha-dhammas, six paramatas.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 And as I said, chamata practice, vipahjana practices, visualizations, and complete state practices.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 That is about it.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And so that is really about the second is morality.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Third morality is performing the beneficial activities for all the sentient beings.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Relatively, indirectly, whether it is big, small, medium, whatever, but do with joy.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Do with open heart.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Do with loving-kindness and body health.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And always keep up with the steady, steadily keeping up the beneficial activities.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Whatever that is.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 In the teaching mentioned, or in the teaching of Harahant, he said,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 now of course we can help the sentient beings.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Now, we can help and start to help as much as we can.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.700
 But really, when we can help is when we reach to the post-Bhoomis, or when we reach to the seeing

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.000
 part.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 That time, our activity of the benefit is becoming more effective, more performing.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Because we see more clearly how things can benefit the health of that.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 But until that, you can always kind of do our best as much as you can.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 With gentle, peaceful manner, with respectful and calm, peaceful.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 What is the teaching? What is the teaching said?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.700
 Sit, sit, politeness, helping benefit the other beings with polite, with respect, with

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.000
 communication,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 with exchanging communication between you and others.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Nice, welcoming, and also the verbal gesture of politeness.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 And the physical gesture of politeness of the smiling.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.570
 Kind of a nice looking, respectfully, according to that. And very kind of thoughtful, very

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.000
 respectful.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 Those are really, really rejected in peaceful manner and brightness.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And then, of course, our heart is treated with the bodhicitta, poor-boneness.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Then help according your capabilities, or our capabilities.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 According to the readiness of others, how much they need, how much they want.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Never push, never pause, never wobble, embossing.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 And gentle, in peaceful manner, helping to the others, with respectful politeness.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 And be as friend, be as like, as intimate friend of you can make.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Be friend, and support, and say, share their feelings, share their intentions,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 forward, according, then helping to the others as much as you can.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 But when we reach to the first, we'll be on the same path.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 And the teaching said, at that time, then really you can more effectively benefit

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 for all sentient beings of those times.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Then in the teaching said, you can use such as full tools

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 to gathering them and support them to the others.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 And kind of politeness, and with that, generosity practice.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Do generosity, and generosity is material generosity,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 and teaching generosity, protection of the support

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 and help by assisting the generosity.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Also whatever they needed, whatever you can do, then do those things.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 At the same time, share the feelings, share their kind of interior thoughts.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Mundle with them. We're not just kind of like, support, we're completely kind of like isolated

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 person.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 We mundle with them, with politeness, and ejector, and respect, and respect the members.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 At the same time, then whatever we see, teaching generosity, whatever we see,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 for example, support to the others, and we also do that too.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 We're not just only the talkers, talking. We are practitioners.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 We are also continue to keep up that.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 So then it's not just an alien, or you're not talking something.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Something from your brains, but talking from the heart.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 And we completely calm and peaceful matters.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Those are in the teaching said, so do that, benefit you to send me this.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 At any time we will benefit you to able to do something to help,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 and we'll be happy ourselves. Happy. And we, may I able to do more next time,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 by the blessings of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 And whatever the merit I gain from this, and I gain, may that benefit you for all living beings,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 for their enlightenment, for their, removing their suffering and difficulties,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 for all of us, and for everything else. Everything is really dedicated in that merit.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 So those are in the teaching said, said, said, said, the morality that will

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 benefit you for all sending this.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Again in the teaching said, as it already said,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 indirectly, big, small, medium, whatever you can, we can help.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 With joy, with the opportunity, and with respect, with politeness.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 That is what the teaching said.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 So that is my great talk for today, of this morality.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Again, thank you very much everyone for participating.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 And now we do this practice of the Nikiles, and now we're going to do the Achilles.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Actually, what's called Stenless King. Stenless King practice is really, again, so important.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And for example, when we do the, we did it by accidentally, maybe not intentionally,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 but many times we do kind of unwholesome activities that happen in the Nikiles.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 And what is the best? To put it by. To put it by, clearly said.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 There is no negativity that we cannot put it by.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And therefore, to put it by is so important.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 So this Stenless King is really one of the very powerful tools of the put it by and negativity.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 What in the teaching said, poor powers, we use poor powers, this time.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Radio circle, inseparable definition, so there is radio circle, oh, no.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Inseparable and radio circles. Then we join this practice.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And each of those are minor of the negativity, what that happened to our body, speech mind.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 We put it in practice.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 In the teaching always, one of those great masters in the teaching said,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 put it by the negativity with poor garrisons. Garrisons?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Or poor army brigades? Army brigades.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 That is so, that negativity is so powerful, you have to have really strong garrisons.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Garrisons, those are upset.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 Those are the garrisons of the body, garrisons of the speech,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 garrisons of the mind, and garrisons of the whole.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 All that. And body garrisons, what?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 They said it during the post sessions.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Or put it hand, tall heart center, well with giant hand.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 And speech garrisons is reciting the prayers, reciting these prayers.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Those are the speech garrisons.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 And mental garrisons, it is reciting the mantra of the Vedic Satas,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 reciting the mantra of the Vedic Satas.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 And garrisons to poor all, it is not meditative in the Doki status, or absolute truth.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Those are known as realization, the completion of grace, or the absolute natures.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 That is garrisons to all who are in front of them.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 And with those garrisons, they know what we make the offerings that time.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.880
 And they say the offering of the dharma, offering of the rakta, offering of the amirtha, offering

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.000
 of the light offerings.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 All limited up, all lighted up, and fulfilled them.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 And that is also represented our body channel with essence elements, and our awareness goes.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.270
 We are the offering. So with those every practices, such as Sten's King, it is very powerful and

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.000
 very special practice.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.350
 Really, in the teachings, it will glorify obscurations and also restore that our merit is so

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.000
 powerful.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 So therefore, in the teachings, of course, we do now 10th day and 25th day, which is good.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Each time in a month, each month, we do two times, which is wonderful.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So it is, in a way, purification practices.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Or it is like sojung. When I teach, it says purify and restore practice, sojung practices.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Or in a way, when I teach, it says nakso means restoring of the samaya problems.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 It is broken, so it is a very, very special practice.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 So that also we are going to do now, do these practices.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 So those are just, I thought, mind it again.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Mind it and thank again for what is ready. We have time.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Now we stay. We do the Sten's King practices.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 And then we do all the mena healing practices.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 And then the nana chakra ceremony of the Dakini Shinshoja.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 And so those are our experience.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Now we do again for a short time.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Short time, the meditation.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Silence is also meditation.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 Or Mohammedar meditation.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Or Upandaparanar meditation.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 And that is what we are going to do.
