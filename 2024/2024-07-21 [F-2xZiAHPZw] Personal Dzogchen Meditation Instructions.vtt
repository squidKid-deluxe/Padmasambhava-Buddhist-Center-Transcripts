00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 atoms and atoms become the wireless atoms and then kind of trying to see because everything must, M

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.700
-A-S-S, I believe, it started from the atoms, it's all, and that is, I think, it's all scientific or

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.480
 then those are the quantum pieces, it aggregates everything, it started from the atoms, atoms,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.000
 atoms are also can be bracketed, bracketed, all that to the final stages.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.360
 In the final stages, there's nothing really existing of all that. In each particles, they're also

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.000
 not glued together. Everything is independently operating, is in a way operating everything.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 Therefore, in the Buddha teachings, the dynamic display of the magical illusions is perfectly, each

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.000
 of those atoms, atoms are really moving.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.020
 Everything is transforming according to teaching. I heard that you know better than me, but quantum

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.000
 physics is also discovering those things. It's all that state. And that is externally understand.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.430
 We need to work with our mind and we discuss the mind is pretty from the existing, non-existing,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.670
 neither in either. Those are kind of maybe like simple, kind of easy to say that, but what made

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 actually mind is free from existing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.320
 That we also discuss that mind is in the past, mind is mind in the past, is mind in the future, is

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.000
 mind in the present. Our own mind, what the answer we find each time we ask is very mysterious.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 This is free from the existing, free from there's nothing really you see. But then what the great

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 master Karmapa, Thar, Thar Karmapa, known as the Raju Dodi, and the same, same word with the great

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 master, Jingbi Langba, mentioned, there is a mind, a guardian of the mind every you see, there's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.000
 nothing is existing, even the Buddha did not show anything.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.710
 Or see anything. Buddha didn't see anything. According to Buddhism or according to teaching, the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.530
 highest level of the wisdom, the Buddha had the highest wisdom, there's nothing higher, deeper,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 more sharper than the Buddha's.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.910
 But as the wisdom is beyond of the image nations, like building the sun, there's nothing is dark,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.910
 nothing is behind. Everything is in prison status in the teaching state. But even Buddha did not

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.000
 see the mind is existing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.100
 And great master Thar Karmapa, as well as Jingbi Langba, even there's nothing existing, the Buddha

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:15.000
 didn't detected anything, didn't see anything. But yet, both samsara and nirvana come from mind.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.360
 So it's not existing. Existing, the Buddha didn't detected or saw or seen, Buddha is actually

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:34.820
 living Buddha, didn't see anything. So there's no mind. No, there is something, that because all s

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.000
amsara and nirvana come from the mind.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.710
 Both samsara and nirvana come from this no mind. This is true. That happened for us too. Even we

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.000
 didn't detected anything about our mind.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.270
 What our whole thoughts, intentions, the prison thinking, the coming from somewhere. It's true. You

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.000
 can, we can validate ourselves. Where does it come from?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.130
 And of course, many times they say their brains. But their brain is like stations. That really

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.000
 where the electricity, electricity of the mind, brain, electricity stations.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.330
 It's not coming from their brain. It's something further deeper, more mystery than brain. It's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.000
 where it's coming from.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.460
 We can see, then larger level in Buddhism, Buddha changing both samsara and nirvana come from the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.000
 mind as we went yet this morning and you know that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.220
 Then what is it? This both exist and non exist now. What? Again, Thar Karmapa and as well as Nirmul

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.000
umba both said, it's not contradicting.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 Not they're not contradicting. One is coming. One is not existing. They're contradicting reality.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.000
 But they're not contradicting. They are union.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:21.400
 They're completely union. Existing that appearance of the mind. What is that? That mind itself is

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.000
 empty. Empty means there's nothing to hold.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.620
 This is not a methodology. It's a myth of stories. We can violate it to you or individual. We all

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.000
 can violate it to our own mind.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Mind is totally, totally union. The moment the mind is arising or thinking that that mind is empty.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 For those of you who are teaching all present, as is empty, as is empty is appearing.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.710
 This is not just playing the game, war games, W-O-R-D, not war games. It's true. True. That is what

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.000
 that is.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 And so that is the nature of the mind. And now we do meditating on that. Meditating is nothing but

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 relaxing, maintaining of that nature.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.320
 We are carried by the force of the display of the mind. And then we're grasping, clinging, holding,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.810
 holding and leveling, one upper, clinging, holding, leveling, leveling, curling. And that is

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.000
 attachment.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.800
 Grazme, those are the teachings mentioned. It's true. We hold it. We release every publication of

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:54.000
 the conceptions and vastness of the nature's mind, its own natural state, and relax it, abiding.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 It's meditation. Meditation is nothing else, again, to do something different, relaxing as it is.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.460
 So we do about an hour about meditating. I mean, I suppose you all know this. Just I'm reminded, in

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.000
 a way, as teaching.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.900
 So we try to maintain that with joy and devotion. Joy and devotion, appreciation is also a display

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.000
 of the mind.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 But there is no substantial, solid existence of joy and devotion and appreciation.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.180
 But this illusion display of the joy and appreciation is so powerful, so healing, so uplifting, so

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.000
 subtle.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 When we have the joy and appreciation, we are free from doubt and hesitation and skeptical.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 And we are not carried by the force of dualities. We are relaxed, resting ourselves.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 When that happened, then the beauty of the nature of the mind began to shine, shine and glow in it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.520
 That is the religious meditation. We target with those, then bodhijas, thinking of all living

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.000
 beings, and put a strong presence of lineage.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.900
 Lineage and all these teachings, what we follow here, what we're trying to follow, is really the

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.000
 voice of wisdom and compassion of all our great masters.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Let's start from the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and we're going to remember some of them.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.990
 How wonderful, how thankful, that we got these wisdom and compassion, lineage, that we are

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.000
 connected.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And it's our lineage. It's not something that somebody else's lineage, we are connected.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 We recapture our domain, our understanding and our own nature and beauty.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.400
 So it's really wonderful, and I just thought to kind of say that those few words and then we really

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.000
 meditate again now.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Thank you very much everyone for participating and everyone. Thank you.
