00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [Bodhi Chata]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Okay, so this morning I'm going to talk about bodhichitta.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 As you all know, this month is a very special month according to the Tibetan Buddhist Calendar.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 When the great teacher Bodhisattvatmani reached enlightenment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 he continued to earn the will of Dharma that brings joy and peace, harmony, and equality to all the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 living beings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.240
 But then in the middle of his life, with the consequences of many different other kinds of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.000
 situations,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 then the Buddha did these miracle activities.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 This is not just that he wants to do these miracle activities,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 but the circumstances and consequences brought up, that is in a way pushed to do these miracle

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 activities.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And that must be also all, it's just kind of dynamic displays that happen, then happening,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 in order to glorify the magnificent and beautiful, the peaceful, authentic gauntlet of the Buddha,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 then he did demonstrate these miracle activities with the, in a way, different contexts.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 So then, this is known as miracle activities. Buddha performed these miracle activities from day

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 one of the lunar calendar,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 about 15 days ago, and he continued to perform these until today.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.530
 Today is the according calendar, or the Buddhist account is the final days of that beautiful

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.000
 display that Buddha performed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.230
 In that time, so many gathered, so many purposes gathered, the devotees gathered, the choristers

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.000
 gathered,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 and all just a general kind of interesting person gathered.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Over hundreds and hundreds of thousands came in the shavastha and then displayed.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.250
 So, today is ever since in the Buddhist, in the very Buddhism, considering this one of the very

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 special month,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 that brings a lot of good energy, of the positive energy, virtuous energy.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And there's a kind of big currents moving in the time zone, that very beautiful spiritual energy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Every kind of ride on that, in a way, this is what's called a big kind of surfing days.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Every ride on that surfing boat, we really can, kind of, erecting or evaluating beautiful energy

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 and beautiful realization.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And therefore, it is also known as a multiplying month.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And one, very truly activities transformed and multiplied over a hundred thousand times.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 That's what the teaching said. So, this is very special day.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.260
 I'm not very so happy that you're all able to come and participate through this beautiful days and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.000
 times.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 We're all together. And so, thank you very much for organizing and making this time.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 And just thank everything. Thank you very much.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And so, therefore, again, we thought to do a little bit about as still also ask of Mary,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 to ask to do a little bit of both each other.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And then, I also thought to give some transmissions of this.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Many of you already have those transmissions.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 But, again, it's just a reminding of our practice and our meditation,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 reconnecting by and deepening our practices.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So, I thought to an honor of the lineage and all the practitioners.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I thought to do these transmissions.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And then, after that, we do a short practice and the celebration of the wedding

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and priest with honor of the Buddha's activities.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So, those are the, kind of, what we thought to do.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 So, now, we've talked about the both each other.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And, of course, many of you, I mean, you all know the both each other, both each other.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And both each other is generally the foundation and the center column of the Buddha's teaching.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And, therefore, I mean, entirely Buddha's teaching.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Eighty-four thousand different teachings or nayana teachings,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 all like three basket teachings, all three turning the wheel of Dharma.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Everything is really best on this both each other.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 There is nothing else Buddha spoke besides both each other's teachings that way, all the way.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And both each other, what is both each other?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It's nature. Nature teaches.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Nature of ourself, nature of others.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And our brain, the harmonizing, how beautiful ourself and others,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 and that is really the teaching of both each other.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And we all know, we are in samsara, as we call it samsara.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Samsara has a lot of bumpy situations, a lot of challenges.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Bumpy goes up and down, and there are so many challenges, difficulties,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 unpleasant things come up because all this is a leg of contracting to the natural

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and a leg of also both each other, understanding.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And that's why all these troubles and difficulties, bumpy situations arise.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Therefore, both each other is just so special and just so beautiful

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 because it's touching to the core of our nature and our beauty and the beauties of others.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And we begin this value and importance of everything.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 In the Vedayana teaching, often teaching tells everything is a purity status.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 But also, if we have the true love and compassion to everyone,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 that is the key to open the door of everything is a purity status.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Nothing is unpleasant, nothing is impure.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 When you have love and compassion, you see everything is so beautiful, so special.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And that is both each other.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Both each other, of course, I think you all know, but again, is reminded to each other, us.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 It's both each other, it's love, both each other is compassion, and both each other is wisdom.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Vastra, this three beautiful components of the nature of the mind is known as both each other.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 In fact, there is no enlightenment, no Buddhahood beside this both each other.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Therefore, the greatest teacher, Gaurabh and Masambhav mentioned these three.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Love and compassion, Vastra, are the mind of the Buddha.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 This is the mind of the Buddha.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 One we are with the authentic true love.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 We are with the mind of the Buddha.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 One we are authentically with the mind with compassion.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 We are in that moment with the Buddha mind status.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Then similarly, wisdom.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So there is no Buddhahood or no enlightenment besides

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 loving kindness and compassion and a wisdom that has no discrimination.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 This is what is so important and so special.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It is our own nature of the mind.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 It's not outside. Love is, as we all know, love is not going to come outside.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And compassion is not going to come outside.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And all the wisdom has to be revealed within ourselves.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 External will support, help, condition, their condition.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 They can't really re-glorify those qualities.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 But true love, true compassion and wisdom that merge from the mind.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 When we extend that light of love and compassion from our heart and mind,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 we feel the power of love and compassion to ourselves.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Also others will feel that too.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Therefore, this bodhicitta is just the foundation, center column,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 and the embodiment teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And as well as practice of the Buddha and Gopin Masambha,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 all those great lineage masters, all those great practitioners

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 who practice this bodhicitta and reach higher realization

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 and discover this, become the Buddha.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 With all the bodhicitta, there is no enlightenment.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And no happiness, no joy and no peace.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And therefore, this bodhicitta is just really very, very special

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 and very, very crucial.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 We like to bring peace, happiness to ourselves.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And also we like to bring happy and joy, peace to other beings.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Therefore, this bodhicitta is very, very, very special and very important.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Thank you.
