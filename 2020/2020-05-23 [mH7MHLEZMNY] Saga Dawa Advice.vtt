00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.910
 Because in Sagadawas, the gracious teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni, got enlightenment, and he was born,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.160
 and he also entered Mahabharic Nirvana.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.610
 Those are the three variables. And then also in the teachings, he taught all the nations in Sagadaw

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.040
as.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.860
 When he left the kingdom, he taught all the nations of Sagadawas. Then he also conquered all the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.760
 Maras,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.010
 so due the Maras on this month, in the full moon. And also in the teachings, he walked to Gita, the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.800
 Enlightenment,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:45.400
 which is accounted as one of the events by the great master material. So all that events are

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:55.960
 all happening in this month. Sagadawas. Today is the eve of the Sagadawas, which is the new moon.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 Today is according to Vedic calendar, lunar calendar. Tomorrow begins. So if we can, again,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.840
 anywhere you could do really little more practice, virtuous activities, non-violence practices,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 and also react with our vows of the rafuddhi vows, bodhijata vows, or such as a vow, take the new,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.160
 or kind of react with it, or take the vows of the eight perceptus that you know, which is the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.120
 shortest

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.920
 vow for the 24 hours, from dawn to the dawn. That means this today's dawn, this morning,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.840
 to the tomorrow's dawn. So it's like shortest vow to take those vows. But I told those things,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.560
 I think, tomorrow, that we'll be able to act. And then also become vegetarians,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.400
 ever you can. And we like to encourage that to myself, and to everyone, at least two weeks,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.360
 or maybe hold this next month Sagadawas, which is really wonderful. It's just

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 following the footsteps of the Buddhas, the bodhisattvas, the whole body, our every great

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.080
 master's. And this is so special. And I just approach that. And also in the teaching said,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.840
 if we do that military activity at this time, it is going to multiply a trillion times.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:26.360
 So this is like, according to the Buddhism, it is really bonus days, big bonus, big bonus for our

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.640
 enlightenment. Big bonus for men, what we're talking about, that's to benefit to all beings,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 is really the bonus day. So don't miss out. Don't miss out on these opportunities.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.880
 It's just only coming once in a year. So please, that's what I just thought today.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.960
 I told a little bit about those few things, a little bit about the highlight. Of course,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.000
 you all know that. But I'll talk a few things tomorrow. Thank you very much everyone for

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.200
 participating in coming. And really, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
