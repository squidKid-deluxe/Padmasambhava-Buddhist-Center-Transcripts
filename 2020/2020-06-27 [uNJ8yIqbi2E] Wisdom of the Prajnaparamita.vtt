00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640
 Thank you again everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you. We continue again. We are going to talk

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.520
 about the teachings of all the six Paramatas.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:27.320
 In particularly, we are going to discuss the sixth Paramatam. That is what we are going to discuss.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 The sixth is the Prajnaaramatam.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.920
 The Prajnaaramatam, in debate, is known as Hiratya Paravdha Shambha. Hiratya Paravdha Shambha, or

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.080
 the transcendental wisdom, is the principal, or the eye of all the six, five Paramatas.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:59.290
 And so, it is so important, and so special. And when we have the understanding of the transcend

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:08.180
ental Paramatam, or what is the Paramatam, then it really makes all the Paramatas are perfect, it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.240
 will lead to the exhality, to the enlightenment, or to the path that we are going to advance in

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.720
 them.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.350
 Again, to observe and to reflect on this teaching, again, we are going to re-stain our motivations,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 or the attitude, the motivation of the joy and appreciations, being great souls.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.840
 This is also not just, as I said, quite a few times, not just once in a while, we reflect that.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.040
 Whenever you can reflect and thank this attitude or this motivation, as much as even in the United

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.290
 Day time, it is the essential, very powerful practices, we are touching to the goal of our own true

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.480
 nature and the nature of the mind.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.730
 At the same time, with that joy and appreciation, being grateful, and then bodhicjata. And bodhicj

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.720
ata is the essential practices of the all, entirely generally Buddhism, particularly Mahayana

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.680
 Buddhism.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.980
 Bodhicjata makes it, but then it becomes known as Mahayana, as one of all the great masters in the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.480
 teaching, mention that again and again, bodhicjata is essential.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.840
 And bodhicjata, again, simplifies to make that, what it means, bodhicjata creates compassion and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.480
 with emptiness realization, or union of the compassion and emptiness, that is really bodhicjata.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.960
 And that, if we have that in our mind and heart, then surely we are going to the Buddha's goal, to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.480
 the path of enlightenment.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 So therefore, again, we activate that, this is our really, the heart practices, our goal, our

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.480
 destination, and so with that.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.480
 And then along with that, combined with bodhicjata, then purely understanding.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.830
 Again, those are all those three different kind of things, one after another, but reality, all is

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.480
 the same, there is no difference.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.830
 When you have to perfect the bodhicjata, then it becomes the mandala of the loving, kind, and the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.480
 compassion.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 Loving, kind, and the compassion, wisdom, that is really the mandala.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 That mandala is the deity, that is the Buddha.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 Love, compassion, and great emptiness of the wisdom, that is divine mandala.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.480
 That is the mandala, that is the three major status.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.000
 So it is just another perspective, another understanding, to explore, glorify our innate nature and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.480
 realization.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.820
 So again, and this is again a very powerful practice of the Skilpumains and Vaidyana teachings,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.480
 three major status.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.480
 Again, we activate those.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 With those thought, and now we go to the Pandya Paramata.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.620
 Pandya Paramata is essential practices, as I said so many times, and you know, every teaching is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.480
 measured.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 This is really the essential practices.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.900
 And the Pandya Paramata is now, when we play, when more can relate, to treat, targeted, and to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.480
 highlight of the wind at a practical level,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.480
 then Pandya Paramata is divided into three sections, as we went yesterday.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.480
 And those are the studying, contemplating, and practicing, or the meditation, meditation.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.480
 And I'm using those two practices, too, terminology, any of them, but practice or the meditation,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.480
 it's the same, and that.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 So among that three, this is three, ladies, wisdoms.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 But that wisdom, how we gain that wisdom, that wisdom gains.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.480
 Suppose we have to study, that is a study.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:14.150
 By studying, knowing the meaning, old meaning, and the meaning of the teaching, or whatever you

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.480
 study, that is wisdom of a study.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:30.820
 Then after you understood the meaning, and old meaning, and it is a meaning, then you begin to also

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.480
 now contemplate on that.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.480
 Analyzing, and kind of expanding knowledge.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.630
 With it, again, from the teachings, from the Masters, or from the book, or from your friends, or

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.480
 whatever.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.710
 Expanding the knowledge, so Sangha members, expanding the knowledge, something that we got really

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.480
 tangible knowledge in our heart, in mind, or in brain.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
 That is known as the wisdom of contemplation.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 And so that is the really wisdom of contemplation.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.550
 As you understood of the wisdom that comes by contemplating, and through also studying and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.480
 listening, now you begin to read practices.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:32.480
 Practicing is knowing how you are really doing this, not just keeping that intellectual knowledge,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:42.480
 but you are going to absorb that teaching into the heart and make yourself rely on that.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.480
 Not just intellectually and theoretically, but bring that understanding, bring that realization,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.480
 verbally in our mind or our wisdom status.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.480
 That is known as the wisdom that comes from meditation.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.480
 So this is one after another, it is all connected.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:12.480
 Now since wisdom is so important, and wisdom that also means, as I said earlier, and you all know,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.480
 knowing exactly the way things are.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.480
 Exactly the way things are.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:27.700
 That is nothing higher state, nothing lower status, or deprecated, or lower, or underestimated, or

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.480
 overestimated.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.480
 Simply direct as it is.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 So that means to understand the whole knowledge.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.480
 The whole knowledge we are trying to brain understand, if you can, or if you can.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.480
 In order to be there, in the Buddha teaching, it is always for the praise of the true truth.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.480
 You all know, we all do so many times, true truths.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.480
 True truth is what we are going to brain understand through the wisdom, through the studying,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
 through the contemplating, through the meditation and the practices.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 That is related to truth.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.480
 So true truth is what we are going to understand.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 True truth encompasses both samsara and nirvana. Everything is within true truth.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:37.480
 For those reasons, in the J.K. also open mission, Nagarjana said, all the entire Buddha teaching

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480
 can be summarized into truth.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.480
 Which is, to truth are relative truth and absolute truth.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:56.460
 So now, that means we are trying to really know exactly what is relative truth, what is absolute

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.480
 truth.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.480
 That is really the knowledge.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.480
 How are we going to know that?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.480
 That is we are studying, contemplating, and meditating, and practicing.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.480
 Explore the meaning as it is.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 That is true truth.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.480
 Now, true truth, of course, you all know, we all heard, at least the name we heard so many times.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.480
 So true truths are, in it a bit, kundru kyendemba and tondam kyendemba.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.480
 That is true truth.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:44.480
 In English translated, I think many times, I saw, in Arabic, is relative truth and absolute truth.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.480
 So that is true truth.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:55.480
 Now, this true truth has many different ways of interpreting of all the different Buddhist schools,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:05.690
 or sometimes called doctorates. What are those? Sathya said, vibhishkas, suvintikas, mind-only

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.480
 schools,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 and mademaka schools.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 Those are different way, independent, slightly different.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.840
 All these Buddhists, all these, like the Buddha, all over the Buddha, take it, but slightly

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.480
 different explaining.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.480
 And I'm not going to go all those different kind of areas of the different school,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:37.480
 and just go directly to the one in the mademaka school, how they are explaining of the truth.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:48.480
 Which is, among the old way of true truth, the division layout is considering that is the more best

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.480
 and direct to that.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:59.130
 Of course, each school of those different schools, also there is point, is exactly where things are

00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.480
.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.480
 Ah, that's it. There is nothing really much big contradicting to that.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.480
 But according to all the great masters in the Tibetan Buddhism,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 I imagine the mademaka way of establishing and discovering and pointing out true truth is the best.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480
 That is more relevant.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 So now we go over to truth, really, of that.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.480
 So that means the world.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:35.480
 Now we start at the true truth, and contemplate on the true truth, and meditate on the true truth.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.480
 Then we do that, then we delete it, and then combine with all the other parameters,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.480
 such as all the five parameters.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.480
 If we combine with it, then it really leads us to the enlightenment, to the Buddha book.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:59.480
 It will dispel the old obscurations, negativities, and discover our inner natures.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.480
 So that is what really purpose, or that is what is.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.480
 Why we not get enlightenment, or why we are not Buddha town?

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.480
 Why? Because of obscurations.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.480
 This obscuration is not according to teaching.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.480
 It is not permanent.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 It is temporary.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.480
 And so even though it is temporary, you have to remove.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.480
 You have to claim it.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.480
 It was not an ordinary time.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.480
 It came.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 How that came?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:44.480
 It is, then, through the delusion of our mind.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.480
 It created that.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.480
 Then it came.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 Now it looks like it appeared in solid.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.480
 Perhaps it is clean.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.480
 In order to do that, that is what needs this according to teaching.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.480
 Starting, contemplating, and meditating.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.480
 So that is generally understood.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.480
 Now we go over to the truth.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480
 First is kundu-keh-demba.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:16.480
 In a Tibetan word, related to truth, which is in a Tibetan word, kundu-demba.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.480
 Tibetan word has three words.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 Tibetan has three words.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 In ancient times, those words emanated, the task letters,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.480
 translated from Sanskrit to the Tibetan language, kundis-vo.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.480
 In Sanskrit, I think, sambhirata, satyam.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
 Those are the teachings said.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 That verb, in Tibetan, translated as kundu-keh-demba.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.480
 And so it has three words.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.480
 kund, zog, zog, and demba.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480
 Demba.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.480
 And what is kund now?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.480
 Kund means all, everything.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.480
 Zog means what?

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.480
 Artificial.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.480
 Artificial.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.480
 And not is true.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480
 Like artificial.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.480
 Or hallucination, maybe I can't ask whether that.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.480
 But artificial.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.480
 Demba means truth.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.480
 So now how that comes?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 All artificial truth.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.480
 All artificial truth.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.480
 If I use that verb,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.480
 I'm sure you know maybe better verbs in English,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.480
 but I'm at least translating that way now.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 And you can tell yourself, if you get those things,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 what is there known as in Buddhism?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 Contemplating.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.480
 You're investigating, you're analyzing,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.480
 you're searching the accurate meaning of that.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480
 So you can't do that.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.480
 So I'm not translating artificial.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.480
 All artificial.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 Then it has truth.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.480
 Why is it truth?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:17.480
 It is truth to the illusion mind.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 It is true for the illusions.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 This illusion, all illusions are true for the illusion beings.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.480
 So that means, that also indicates indirectly

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.480
 all the sentient beings are deluded.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.480
 When they're deluded, things are a bit, it's true.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 That is, for example,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.480
 when you are intoxicated by the drugs.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.480
 Things are a bit, not really exist a bit,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.480
 but for that individual, it's true.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.480
 That appearance, or that feeling, whatever it is,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 reality level, or we call it, or it's because of drugs,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.480
 or because of alcohols.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 But even though it is, for that individual, it is really true.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:25.480
 Therefore, same way, this all illusion is true for the illusion beings.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.480
 In which sense it's true for the functioning.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:36.480
 We see, or we see, we talk about that, we function with that.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480
 Therefore, it is called true.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.480
 Now this is the Buddha teaching.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.480
 Buddha teaching, when you are starting anyway, starting, or you can contemplate on that,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 it's true or not.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.480
 That is known as the contemplative.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.480
 The regular teacher, Buddha Shakta Muni himself said,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.480
 "You don't have to believe what I said."

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:12.480
 You investigate, investigate, analyze, put the analytical, examine that.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.480
 So, you can examine, but that is what is known as relative truth,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.480
 which is translated into English, relative.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 Maybe the relative has that similar meaning, what I say, all illusions.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 Relatives. Truth, that is truth.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 Now, the second one is absolute truth.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.480
 In a Tibet, it translated again those emanation, great oscillators in the 8th century.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 Tom dam tye dhemba.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.480
 In a Sanskrit, I heard it as prama aat satyas, prama aat.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.480
 In that week, translating into a Tibetan, Tom dam tye dhemba.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 And what again there is three words, Tom, Tom, and dhemba.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:15.480
 Tom means again meaning, meaning, and Tom, Tom, D-O-N, Tom.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480
 That's what they are, Tom.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.480
 And of course, it may be similar kind of accent, too.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:30.480
 Tom and dham, D-E-A-N, Tom dam, dhemba, D-E-N-P-A, dhemba.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:40.480
 So, Tom means meaning, and dham means the supreme, noble.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.480
 So, it means supreme meaning, supreme meaning, and dhemba means truth.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:54.480
 So, truth of supreme meaning, truth of supreme meaning, I'm translating that.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 And we translate it into English, absolute truth, absolute truth.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.480
 So, maybe we can say, absolute noble truth.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.480
 According to Tibetan, maybe that's my interpretation.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 Absolute noble truth.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.480
 Why is it called like a Tom or absolute noble truth?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:32.480
 Because there is nothing higher, nothing deeper, nothing direct, more to the true nature than this.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 Therefore, it is supreme or noble.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 This is simply the direct nature.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.480
 There's nothing more to explore than this.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 There's nothing higher to go, deeper to go.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 Oh, this is not something insignificant.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.480
 It's not something that enough.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.480
 Enough, if there is something more, no.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.480
 According to the teaching, that is, that's it.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.480
 There's nothing more to go.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.480
 And this is, when you go to the realization of this, you will gain the supreme meaning.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.480
 Supreme benefit, it really brings the perfect benefit.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:24.480
 For that reason, the supreme meaning, the ultimate meaning, ultimate goal.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.480
 Then why, what is called demba?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.480
 Because this truth never going to change.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.480
 It remains as it is.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.480
 For those reasons, what in the teaching said,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 whether Buddha came to this world and gave the teaching of the Pandyavara Mother,

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:52.480
 that's not going to improve the absolute meanings of great nature.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.480
 When Buddha did not come to this world and give not any teachings,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:07.480
 that will not decrease or decolify the nature.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.480
 Oh, whether we rely on this nature, it's not going to improve the nature.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.480
 Whether we don't recognize it, it's not going to devalue of the nature.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.480
 Nature remains as it is, all the time, according to the teaching.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.480
 So this is what is really known as absolute truths.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.480
 So this is the true truth that we are going to explore.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:44.980
 In order to get enlightenment, we have to understand of this true truth quite beautifully and

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.480
 perfectly as it is.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.480
 So now, because of that, now what in the teaching said?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:04.480
 Now we will see this, all these relevant truths, all this illusion truth.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.480
 Where it is, why is it all illusions?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:18.480
 Because according to the teaching, they are not feminine, they are not solid,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:29.480
 they are not concrete existing, they are mainly displayed on the space.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 How that comes?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:39.480
 That is according to the teaching, it comes from that great emptiness arising that

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.480
 with interdependent ordination, interdependent ordination,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 or with cause and condition, interdependence and originating things,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 magically, or all these objects, magically arising.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:10.480
 Sense is come from the emptiness arising magically even though we are functioning well,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.480
 we are functioning, it is as magical.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.480
 It is nothing changed with naturals.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:30.480
 Therefore, a great teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni used examples such as dream,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:40.480
 mirage, reflection, moon in the vatals, and double image, all the optical illusions,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:49.480
 all those different examples used in order to ring the bell to our heart.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:55.480
 That is reality, that is relevant truth as it is.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 But then, what is wrong for us?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.480
 But what we see, we don't see the way things are.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:13.480
 We don't see it as a dream, we don't see it as double image or optical illusions,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:22.480
 we don't see it as a mirage, we see solids, concrete exist,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.480
 and can't likewise solid.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 That is what we see.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:35.480
 That seeing, according again to Buddhism, is delusions.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.480
 That seeing is delusion.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.480
 We deluded ourselves.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:49.480
 That is what is known as then, it comes to teaching on true egolessness.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.480
 We all heard egolessness.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.480
 Most of the course, egolessness, ego is, in teaching, always in Buddhism,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.480
 there is no egos, no eyes.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 That's what we heard, that's what you also heard, and I heard you heard.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:20.480
 And then, in the second, and particularly in Mahayana, highly explaining,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.480
 phenomena egos, also is a phenomena egos.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.480
 So now, what is in Buddhism?

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:35.480
 Ultimately, it is true egolessness.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:43.480
 Ego-nessness of self-egolessness and egolessness of the phenomena.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.480
 So that is really coded teaching in Buddhism.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.480
 It is true, not making up.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.480
 But now, when we heard this, I mean it's not just the posture of you heard.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 I'm sure you've heard, you've been practicing Buddhism,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.480
 I'm sure you've heard many, many hundred times of this.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 Those who have already heard, it's all starting.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.480
 All you heard, you learned, but you are going to contemplate on that.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.480
 It's true or not.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480
 You are going to contemplate.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.480
 When you gain the knowledge, convey tangible knowledge

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.480
 from the contemplate of the teaching of that,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.480
 that is known as the wisdom of the contemplations.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.480
 You gain the wisdom.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.480
 That wisdom is closer to the coded Buddhism.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.480
 It's true nature now.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.480
 If the intellectual is a theoretical theory,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.480
 but yet, it's close to the way the nature is.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.480
 So we're getting like almost twilight zone of the enlightenment.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.480
 From the darkness coming, without the dawn coming.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.480
 Even though it's not completely fully shined,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.480
 fully glorified and played bright,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.480
 but we are in the twilight zone,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.480
 a bigger understanding of that is kind of really true, as it is.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 So that is known as contemplatives.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.480
 So now the first we think of these two egolessences.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.480
 The first is, after we think of these two ego,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.480
 and now what's called, in Tibet,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.480
 Chudya dha, Khaza dha.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.480
 Khaza dha is a self ego.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.480
 Individual ego, Khaza dha.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.480
 Chudya dha, I'm translating, phenomena egoless.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.480
 And this is also known as what?

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.480
 I add to another word with that.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.480
 Chudya dhanji.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.480
 Khaza dha dhanji.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.480
 Chudya dhanji means clinging on the phenomena egos.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.480
 And second is, Khaza dha dhanji.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.480
 Clinging on the individual egos.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.480
 So this is now ego.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480
 Ego.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.480
 According to the Buddha teaching and all the great masters,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 the old troubles in the samsara

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 is because of this clinging of the ego.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.480
 And of all the vibing of enlightenment,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.480
 because of clinging on the phenomena,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 ego clinging will not get enlightened.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.480
 Or in the teaching, somebody says,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.480
 when clinging to the self ego,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.480
 clinging to the self ego,

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.480
 clinging on the self ego,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.480
 it is preventing our liberation.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.480
 Clinging to the knowledge or the phenomena ego,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
 clinging ego will prevent our omniscient of the Buddha Buddha.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.480
 That's what the teaching says.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.480
 Those are now really, in a way, what we're talking now is,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.480
 in a way, the heart philosophy or heart teaching of the Buddhism.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480
 Buddhism.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480
 The philosophy.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.480
 When you meditate, when you meditate,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.480
 we meditate the egolessness.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 No, necessarily we think, oh, there's no ego,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480
 and we're not thinking of the negational state of that.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.480
 That, but we really meditate, maintain on that,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.480
 that free from the egolessness states.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.480
 We don't have any reference points.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480
 That means what?

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.480
 I'm pointing that reference point means,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.480
 there's nothing reference point over the existing, non-existing,

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.480
 neither, and either.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480
 You know that terminology.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.480
 You heard it so many times.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480
 I'm talking that.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.480
 You're relaxing that.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.480
 Clinging on the negation or the existing is clinging.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.480
 Thinking of the existing is clinging.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.480
 Thinking of this non-existing is clinging.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.480
 And thinking of the existing is clinging.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.480
 Neither, it is not just a kind of play game of the words.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:25.480
 W-O-R-D is not playing the word or syllabus.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.480
 It is highlighting, touching to the point,

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.480
 the core, the king, core, the natures, nature.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 Any clinging, any reference point have to be released

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.480
 to where it comes from.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480
 Where it comes from.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480
 What that means?

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.480
 To the great emptiness.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.480
 It arises from the great emptiness.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.480
 It's hovering in the great emptiness.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.480
 Or if I use the clear, precise word,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.480
 it comes from the clear emptiness mind.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.480
 It's hovering in the emptiness mind

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.480
 or the space of the emptiness.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.480
 Let it go back to the emptiness space of the mind.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.480
 What do you hope?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480
 What do you hope?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.480
 That's what I read in the teaching said.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:32.480
 So therefore, this clinging is fundamental obstacles

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.480
 to get enlightenment or to get liberation.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.480
 What that means is liberation, I'm using.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 And what is the teaching said?

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.480
 Nirvana is the liberation status.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.480
 So that means to have to remove,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.480
 in order to reach the arahata hope,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.480
 according to the Shravakayana,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.480
 you have to release the ego clinging.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.480
 You have to remove.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.480
 Your clear way, where to remove?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.480
 Again, to the emptiness.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480
 Remove.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.480
 There is no hold.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.480
 Anything to hold.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.480
 So that is really, again, a point.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.480
 So now what I'm talking about,

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.480
 this is what we're going to, as we learn,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.480
 or as we learn, we're going to contemplate.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.480
 Contrapletting is the way to explore deep meaning,

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.480
 not just only Buddha said, Narajana said,

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.480
 the great master, Mohan Bhajan Bhajan Bhajan,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.480
 said, you know, this and that thing,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.480
 that we are also great master, Shraddhara said,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.480
 we're really putting our own intelligence.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.480
 That means we are also sharpening up our own intelligence,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.480
 our wisdom, our knowledge.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.480
 Knowledge is what we need for you.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.480
 When we do the meditation, we need to meditate.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.480
 When we meditate, we're going to meditate

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.480
 with certainty, wisdom.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.480
 Certainty, wisdom that which is free from doubt

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.480
 and hesitation and skeptical.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.480
 Play, believe, free from the cloud of the doubt

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.480
 and hesitation and skeptical

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.480
 and then we meditate on that nature

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.480
 and then really we can explore the horizons

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.480
 of the great natures, abilities,

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.480
 both external and internal.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.480
 So therefore, for those reasons, then it's so important,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.480
 so crucial to explore.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.480
 So now again, I go back to the two ego, eagles.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.480
 Firstly ego is what we start.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.480
 The two eagles, the self ego

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.480
 and the phenomena ego or self ego.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.480
 Then I said self ego clinging

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480
 and the phenomena ego clinging.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.480
 So I added another word, clinging, clinging, two words.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.480
 Self ego clinging, phenomena ego clinging.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:17.480
 And where those eagles are, those two eagles are,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.480
 these two eagles are, self ego clinging

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:31.480
 existing our own physicals or our own disaggregates.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.480
 And the phenomena ego clinging to all the object substances

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.480
 or five objects, all these phenomena objects.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.480
 Another word.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.480
 So they are how we hold, how we cling.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:54.480
 When we're clinging, we're clinging without clear knowledge.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.480
 We're clinging without clear wisdom.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.480
 We're clinging with clear understanding.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.480
 We're clinging with presumptions.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.480
 We're not clinging because we see something as a quote.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.480
 No, it's just presumptions.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.480
 It's just kind of evolving in a way, expecting and whole thinking.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.480
 How is that?

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.480
 And to what?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.480
 The phenomena ego, sorry, self ego clinging.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480
 I said five objects.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.480
 In the teaching I said, they kind of, with all the investigating

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.480
 and allied with presumptions of every sentient beings

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.480
 are kind of holding ego eye or ego clinging

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.480
 to the continuation, continuation and the combination

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.480
 of the aggregates that all combine together.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.480
 We hold.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.480
 So that means we hold our ego with the continuation

00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:01.480
 of our mind, mind, and with the combination

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.480
 or with the combined together of the aggregates.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.480
 That kind with chunk, that kind of heat, combined,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.480
 then we just hold without emulating.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.480
 That means we don't really clear understanding

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.480
 with presumptions, thinking.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.480
 But that is not that versatile.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.480
 That is the ignorance.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.480
 That is the dullness.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.480
 That is kind of hoping, kind of wishful, you're hoping.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.480
 It's not really because there then we hold.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.480
 It's not just presumptions.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.480
 So therefore, in Buddhism, the greatest teacher,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.480
 Buddha Shakyamuni, all those great masters say, explore.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.480
 Now because this eye is so important for us,

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.480
 there's nothing more important than us,

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.480
 unless you're very bodhisattva, then we do too many practices

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.480
 and dagi yampa and dagi giva, or that we discuss it,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.480
 and you know those.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.480
 But otherwise, ego is so important.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.480
 It's standing firmly among all the groups, told and begun.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.480
 Within a hundred people, among the group, among them,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.480
 I am more important for me, is what say that.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.480
 And we kind of live more politely,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.480
 did that, or I'm more important for myself.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480
 It's true.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.480
 But what that eye, where is that eye? Interesting.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.480
 That is exploring.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.480
 We do things all because I want happy.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.480
 I want help, peaceful.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.480
 And my, also then connected to the ego.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.480
 I, or my friend, my family member, my belong, my country, my this and that,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.480
 and then we just brave so many things.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.480
 Because the eye is now the center, ego is the center,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.480
 and there is so many kind of like mandalas,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.480
 ankarages of the mind, mind, mind.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.480
 There's so many things.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.480
 And then there is also, when we make that territory,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.480
 and there is also something that we are going to push back.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.480
 Those are the others.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.480
 Those are the opponents.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480
 They are like difference.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480
 They are not mine.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480
 They are not God.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480
 They are different.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480
 Follow me, then.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.480
 Come with me. We sold out so many things there.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:29.480
 But reality level, where they are, where that exists.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.480
 And our reality level, now where is this eye?

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480
 Eye.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.480
 And for that reason, I'm not going to talk too many things.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.480
 You all know, know that in the teachings,

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.480
 they pose a chair with the body, five undergears.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.480
 Among the five undergears is pose is what?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.480
 The pome aggregates.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:56.480
 We check that the way is my eye, or my ego, or me.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.480
 Where is me now?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:04.480
 Is with this body, pome aggregate, or with the outside,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.480
 or with between pome aggregate and out and in,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.480
 or between in and out.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.480
 Check every aspect, whatever there is a way that you can check.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.480
 That is known as in Buddhism, contemplating.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.480
 This is known as contemplating.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.480
 You're not just living as kind of blind and kind of covered up

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.480
 and presumed and just like that kind of wish watch says.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480
 Now, is it really?

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.480
 Examine the timing of that.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.480
 You're trying to explore the deep of the truth,

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.480
 where the truth is.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.480
 But it's, explore.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.480
 See, every aspect from the top, top of the head or the head,

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.480
 all the way the truth or soul of peace, from right to left,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.480
 inside, everywhere.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480
 Where?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480
 And what the great Master Shanti Deva said.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480
 But sharp weapon of the wisdom, well cut,

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.480
 cut every aspect of the systems and find out where is I,

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.480
 or where is this important ego.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.480
 If you look everywhere, there is no greater Masters,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.480
 no greater scholar of thought in Buddhism.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 There is independent existing I at all.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.480
 But you don't have to believe.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.480
 We don't have to believe.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.480
 You can look through yourself.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.480
 Find out where is that.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.480
 Really?

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480
 Where is that?

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480
 When you don't find, then that is.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.480
 Where must be?

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.480
 So that means, I, then ego, what is important,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.480
 is not in the physical forms.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.480
 Have you observed?

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.480
 Then you look to other aggregates, feeling aggregates,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.480
 perception aggregates, consciousness aggregates,

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.480
 or conceptual aggregates.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.480
 All those look one after another.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.480
 But those all are mind.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.480
 Simple is mind.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480
 Mental state.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.480
 So where is the mind?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.480
 Actually, where is the ego existing?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480
 In the mind.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.480
 In the past mind, ego is existing on the past mind,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.480
 or future mind, or person mind, or head, out there.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.480
 And that again, you look to that.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.480
 Again, if you look in search, that no one, even Buddha,

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.480
 did not found I.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.480
 And all the greater Masters did not found.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.480
 There is no existing.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.480
 Independently existing.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.480
 I.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.480
 You can look.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480
 A trained associate.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.480
 It's not just a kind of believing that,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.480
 following blindfold.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.480
 That's what great teacher Buddha said, don't do.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.480
 You are examined.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.480
 So now when you start to look to grow all that,

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.480
 and even maybe the modern times,

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.480
 machines, tools, whatever you can do,

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480
 really try to explore.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.480
 If you have the capability to do those high-tech companies

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.480
 and try to explore.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.480
 If they try to find that.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.480
 When is it at home?

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.480
 Then that is.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.480
 That is true.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.480
 That is known as then what?

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.480
 It's known as when you don't find what it does,

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.480
 it will release immediately the clinging of the ego.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.480
 It will at least soften the clinging of the ah.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.480
 And then that is when you really find,

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.480
 you relax and that's this.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.480
 Then that is known as equalism is meditation.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.480
 That means maintaining.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.480
 What meditation means?

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.480
 Make formulas.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.480
 What do you just call it?

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.480
 You now make it more familiar.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.480
 It's not just that intellectually you understand how that's enough.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.480
 In Buddhism, you really have to bring tangible realization,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.480
 more stable realization.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 So that is really explaining of the egolessness

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.480
 or individual egolessness.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.480
 And then phenomena egos.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.480
 Again, phenomena ego is what?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.480
 That means what actually phenomena.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.480
 And the phenomena ego means we cling into everything.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.480
 We hold everything.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.480
 We hold every object.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.480
 Where we think again, we don't kind of like any analyzing

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.480
 or any kind of clear knowledge.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.480
 We presume that that exists.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.480
 And where we think or it came like that from the beginning of this time.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.480
 We just really hold.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.480
 We put that nominations but it nominated that.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:00.480
 We combined with the name and the poem and the structure all together.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.480
 What that means?

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.480
 Name means for example this table.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.480
 We call this table.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.480
 We all call this a table.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.480
 This table is a name.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.480
 This name and this formation is now combined together.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.480
 We call it a table.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.480
 And where we hold, it's kind of existing.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.480
 It truly existed, tangible existed.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.480
 Or we say building.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.480
 Building is a name.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480
 Name.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.480
 But that is structural.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.480
 Structural, that formation.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.480
 That name and that structural combine together

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.480
 and then we hold as a building.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.480
 It's true that.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.480
 But what we holding is we think is a kind of solid.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.480
 We think burning is kind of like building and solid.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.480
 It's terrible.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480
 It's God.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480
 It is that.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.480
 But reality now, what is this?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.480
 It's display according to this.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:11.480
 It's display of the interdependent, interdependence ordination.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.480
 Display.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.480
 That included ourselves too, our body, all this.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.480
 It's just display of interdependent.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.480
 Cause and condition, combined together

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.480
 and then the arising things.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:36.480
 Medically within the space of the emptiness.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.480
 Within the emptiness.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.480
 So this building, for example, not just came

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.480
 to this building from the beginning of this time.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:51.480
 It is so many things to make this building.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:57.480
 Smend, break, aisle, bar, bar

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.480
 and then so many other things and levels.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.480
 And then also each of those have to be not just came solid.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.480
 It has so many things combined and all the way they produced,

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.480
 the way they did and not just one is.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.480
 And all the group works of so many,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.480
 directly, indirectly, cause and condition formed this building.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.480
 This building.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.480
 And the building itself is like display of illusions.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.480
 It is like, in a way, it's a mirage house.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480
 It's forming.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.480
 It's not really solid existence.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480
 Solid.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.480
 Therefore, it has got old.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480
 It got it declared.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.480
 It got damaged.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480
 Because it's not solid.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.480
 It's combination.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.480
 There's nothing really too old as like a name with a poem

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480
 and then all that.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.480
 There's nothing such existing that means.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.480
 All is like, again, illusions.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.480
 And how that things are arising?

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.480
 As I said, it's a magical display

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.480
 of the interdependent ordinations.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:11.480
 Or arising through the interdependence and the connections.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.480
 Arising things.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.480
 Things is merely displays.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:23.480
 There's no substantially solid, permanent, existing, any of these.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.480
 These.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.480
 So there's nothing to be reclaimed in old as we hope.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:35.480
 So this is known as the absolute levels.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.480
 All is true.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.480
 So therefore, then what will things see?

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.480
 And in the relative level, we see things are.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.480
 Are all magical disciplines.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.480
 Magical display of the interdependences.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.480
 And each of those interdependencies displayed is.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.480
 That moment is in a great emptiness state.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.480
 Great emptiness in an infinite state.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.480
 That moment.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.480
 That is subject is in that state.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.480
 Object is in that state.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.480
 That is.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.480
 So that is about the religion in the Buddha's teaching.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.480
 Often measurement.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.480
 When you learn.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.480
 When you read.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.480
 When you're starting.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.480
 And that is not the study.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.480
 But when you're contemplating and trying to get tangible meaning as teaching.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.480
 So you meet something.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.480
 Kind of the meaning of those.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.480
 Those meaning.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.480
 And the clear understanding.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.480
 That is the contrapletions.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.480
 When is the contraplet of that?

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.480
 Then you meditate.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.480
 Then you meditate.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.480
 That is maintaining.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.480
 Meditation is making familiar with the nature is.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.480
 Nature is.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.480
 Then all the techniques you received.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480
 You can use.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.480
 Those are what in the teaching say.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.480
 Free from the like those.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.480
 With all the distractions.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.480
 And free from the scattered mind.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.480
 And darkness mind.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.480
 Maintain that.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.480
 That realization or that discovery of the contrapletions.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.480
 And be in that state.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.480
 So that is what according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.480
 Is really about three verses.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.480
 And now I talk really about again more simple way.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.480
 When you are practicing this.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.480
 Simple practicing this.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.480
 And what is that?

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.480
 That is again starting.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.480
 Contemplating.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.480
 And meditating.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.480
 So among that three poses.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.480
 You study me.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.480
 You receive the teaching.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.480
 From the teaching.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.480
 From the qualified teacher.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.480
 And you receive the teaching.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.480
 With respect and appreciation.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.480
 And observing that teaching.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.480
 With really your inner appreciation.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.480
 And as we've been discussing that.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.480
 So that is studying.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.480
 That is studying.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.480
 As you receive the teaching.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.480
 Now you just let that.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.480
 That's it.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.480
 But after that also your self rehearsing.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.480
 Rehearsing that teaching.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.480
 Trying to really make sure you understand everything.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.480
 To clearly perfectly.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.480
 Precisely that instruction.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.480
 Clearly instruction.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480
 And have you kind of like.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.480
 Rehearsing in your mental state.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.480
 If there is some doubt and hesitation.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.480
 Ask again to the teacher.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.480
 Or to your done apprentice.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.480
 And try to clarify that.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480
 Clarify.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.480
 So you got tangible understanding and knowledge.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.480
 And that is really a essential meaning.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.480
 Of contemplations.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.480
 Contemplators.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.480
 When you got that contemplation.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480
 When you received.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.480
 Now then you begin to really meditate.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.480
 Then meditate in practices.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.480
 And why I am using the practice.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.480
 Because also meditation is not just a silent meditation.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.480
 In very inner teaching.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.480
 There is also virtualization meditation.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.480
 So that means you are also really meditating.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.480
 In a divine medallist.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.480
 Including yourself.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480
 Self.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.480
 So that is also.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.480
 For that reason I am saying the practice.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.480
 But for the meditation.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.480
 So then you meditate.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.480
 Then through that.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.480
 Not just as you can meditate.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.480
 And with imagination.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.480
 But when you have clear understanding.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.480
 Or clear realization comes.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.480
 Comes.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.480
 Then that is known as.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.480
 Wisdom that comes from the meditation.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.480
 And really you shine.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.480
 Wisdom is really truly coming.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.480
 That means.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480
 You see the meaning.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.480
 See the exact teaching.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.480
 That what you received the teaching.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.480
 And what you started and you contemplated.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.480
 And that and now the meditating.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.480
 Those all come together.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.480
 As lined up perfectly.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.480
 Beautifully.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480
 And that is known as.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.480
 Wisdom marries.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480
 Wisdom marries.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.480
 So oh.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.480
 Wisdom.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.480
 Wisdom comes from the meditation.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.480
 And this through this.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.480
 Then we accomplishing.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.480
 Accomplishing two accumulations.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.480
 And generally what in the teaching say.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.480
 Two truths are in a union.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.480
 They are not two separate things.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.480
 As though maybe I already mentioned clearly that.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.480
 But two truths.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.480
 Absolute truth.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.480
 Relate truth.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.480
 They are not two separate things.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480
 Like right and left.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.480
 They are all in the same states.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.480
 Two truths are union.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.480
 Therefore.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.480
 When we practice.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.480
 Two accumulations.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480
 Or the scalable means.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.480
 Muslims are in the union.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.480
 When we practice the scalable means.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.480
 To accomplish in a union.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.480
 Or combined.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480
 Together.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.480
 Without any separation.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.480
 Then.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.480
 We achieve the result.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480
 As two kaia.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.480
 Also without any separations.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480
 Two kaias.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.480
 What that means.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.480
 Again.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.480
 We discussed early.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.480
 Many times kaia.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.480
 But two kaias are dharma kaia and ropa kaia.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.480
 These two kaias are in the union.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.480
 Union.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.480
 So then.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.480
 You got perfect realization.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480
 And what the individual said.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.480
 Here.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.480
 Denizunyo.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480
 Oh yeah.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480
 And used very well in the English.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:33.480
 The foundation of the two truths is union.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.480
 Part of the two accumulations in truth.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.480
 Result of the two kaias.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.480
 Are the union.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.480
 Union.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.480
 So again.

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480
 We have mixed up.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.480
 The two.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.480
 Best of the two truths is in the union.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.480
 And part of the two accumulations is in the union.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.480
 And the two result.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.480
 Result of the two kaias.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.480
 Are in the union.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.480
 Union.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480
 They are not separated.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.480
 They are not true to the things.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.480
 All is in all.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.480
 That.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.480
 So.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.480
 And for those reasons.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.480
 Sometimes in the teaching make it.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.480
 And the apparent aspect of relative truth is real.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.480
 All.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.480
 Apparent aspect of the way things we see.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.480
 Is all relative truth.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:23.480
 The nature of the appearance is absolute truth.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.480
 Truth.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480
 So therefore.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.480
 It is really unions.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.480
 And then skillful means and what's done by unions.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.480
 And that we discuss for six part of mothers.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.480
 We discuss that.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.480
 So six part of mothers.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.480
 All also in the union.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.480
 Even in one part of mother can combine.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.480
 Her contains all six part of mothers.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.480
 It's the union.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.480
 It's not something separate from that.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.480
 When you reach enlightenment, Buddha who?

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.480
 And the realization of the two kaias.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.480
 Kaias even is making division.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.480
 Reality is the union in same sense.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.480
 You become simple to tell.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.480
 You reach the Buddha.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.480
 When you reach the Buddha who?

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.480
 Then you throw your companion.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.480
 You display all those poems, emanations.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.480
 Or it will benefit for all living beings.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.480
 So that is really what is known as that.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.480
 That final kaias.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.480
 And that is my really talk about the three worst terms.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:31.480
 Worst term, the starting, contemplation, and what's called?

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.480
 The meditations.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.480
 And then as I said the two egolessness said.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.480
 But there is many other Buddha teachings.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.480
 Really that is something highlighted.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.480
 You can exam.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.480
 You can analyze.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.480
 For example, a Buddha teaching mechanic.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.480
 For example, this is just already of course we say those things in teaching.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.480
 For example, all compounded things are impermanence.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:01.480
 All compounded things are impermanence.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:08.480
 And all emergent things are sufferings.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:14.480
 And all the phenomena exist are emptiness and egolessness.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.480
 Or empty of the egos.

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.480
 And the nirvana, enlightenment is peaceful.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:28.480
 Those are known as the four famous topics of the Buddhas.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.480
 Buddhas, also you exam.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.480
 Really exam.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.480
 All compounded things are impermanent.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.480
 Commodity is marked.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.480
 All the molecules, all the elements come.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.480
 Whatever the particles, all combined to the things.

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.480
 Whatever that is, it is not going to stay forever.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480
 It's impermanent.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.480
 And it's not really even that instant when you're looking at that.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.480
 It's that instant changing.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.480
 It's completely changing.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.480
 So it's not impermanent.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.480
 All compounded things are impermanent.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:13.480
 That means the mountain, sun, star, earth, our subject and object.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:18.480
 All is a component because all is combined with many particles.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.480
 And how that comes?

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.480
 That is known as what?

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.480
 In the teaching, interdependent or ordination.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.480
 Or interdependent ordination.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:32.480
 Interdependence ordination.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.480
 Milly interdependent ordination display.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.480
 Or display of the merely interdependence ordination.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.480
 Milly.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.480
 That means it's just merely formed by depth.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.480
 The reality is there's no structure, solid.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.480
 It's old.

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.480
 It's best in emptiness.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.480
 It's within emptiness.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.480
 It's going to dissolve in emptiness.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.480
 Emptiness.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.480
 Compounded.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.480
 You have to let the mind through that.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.480
 It's true or no?

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.480
 All the emotions are sufferings.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:18.480
 That means emotions meet all this mind, negative emotions.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.480
 All these emotions.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480
 Everything.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.480
 If things what they've loved it is.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:29.480
 It really is in the teaching.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.480
 That means all over the navy.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:41.390
 In other words, combination of the karma and emotions activity is challenged and difficult and

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:43.480
 sufferings.

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.480
 Those are in the teaching on the relative levels.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.480
 And then the truth.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.480
 Again, she is true or no?

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.480
 She is true or no?

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480
 She is true or no?

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.480
 She is true.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.480
 She is true or no?

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:21.800
 All phenomena, there is no substantial solid existing.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:28.160
 That name, that form we created, everything we created,

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:33.200
 the diluted mind created it, is not something came

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.320
 from the ordinary that.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.800
 It's therefore, it's empty.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.720
 There is no existing identity or anything.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:50.400
 It's free from the identity, free from the existing of the solid.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.920
 Oh, that is what it is.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:56.240
 So really, thank you.

00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.080
 When the karma and the emotions are free, then it is peaceful.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:07.040
 With negative emotions and the activity

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.480
 of that negative emotions when you're free,

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:17.720
 then it is peaceful, peaceful, anything.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:28.360
 Kind of extending our wisdom to all the topics, all those areas,

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.880
 and bring tangible certainty, wisdom in our heart and mind.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.920
 That is known as knowledge.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.960
 That is known as wisdom.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.360
 And through that, then you stand it firmly,

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.480
 practice in the meditation.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.360
 Then really, it will get the realization.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.440
 And it advances.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.600
 Exactly what we discovered, you will see that.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.280
 You will discover that, and that is known as realization,

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.880
 achievement of the spirituals.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.080
 So that is my brief talk for today.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.800
 And thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.760
 And thank everyone, OK?

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.920
 Then I have a short announcement, maybe,

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.800
 that we won't have now for a while.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.120
 It's a talks back, but then it's a Monday step.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.320
 And then we're going to do this, but what's good is Monday?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.400
 Monday is the 10th day, right?

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.360
 Tuesday.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:26.760
 What?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.520
 Tuesday.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.000
 Tuesday.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 Is we're going to do the Zoom or no?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.840
 If you want to object, wonderful.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.040
 Yeah, no.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.400
 Yeah, then we do.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.800
 So we won't have anything for a while.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.000
 But this Tuesday, then Guru Mooji's days,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.760
 then again, we will do those who have time, of course,

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.240
 during this weekday, and it's a walking day.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.880
 If we have time, please join us.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.080
 And then we do that, and then Guru Mooji practices.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.960
 Guru Mooji's days, so practice on that.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.360
 And then that-- and also, I just thought

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.320
 to tell that our Dharma centers in the natural and Tennessee,

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.440
 they are opening on the internet or the Zoom.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.120
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.400
 practices every Tuesday, right?

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.040
 Tuesday.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.320
 So if you can join that, it's really wonderful.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.840
 Practice on the [INAUDIBLE] practice

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.000
 on the absolute Western practice.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.080
 Or what we're talking, [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.400
 Western practices.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.320
 That's how we started, from the beginning, in Nathalieux.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.160
 Inexpressible and inconceivable, [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.400
 absolute by nature, like the sky.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.240
 That's what we are really practicing.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.480
 And then, even though it's an absolute nature, all that,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.200
 but it cannot be.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.760
 It will recognize, but pristine cognition on its own,

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.800
 awareness can recognize and realize.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.240
 That means it will bring the resistance to the wisdom

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.800
 of the profound meaning of the absolute truth,

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.720
 perceived and the clarity of all the Muslims

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.120
 that will arise with this.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.880
 So this is the Heart Sutra practice.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.800
 It is really the heart of the old Pandya Paramata teachings

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.440
 that Buddha gave.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.440
 And those are known as 100,000 strands of the Pandya Paramata

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.480
 teachings that are combined on this Heart Sutra.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.880
 According to media TG...
