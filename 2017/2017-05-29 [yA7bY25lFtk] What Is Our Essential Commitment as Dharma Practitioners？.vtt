00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.190
 When you don't know, "samaya" means keeping the commitment. Our courage and confidence, with that,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.180
 keep the commitment as we started.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.390
 And what we have the commitment? We have a commitment to bring up our identity of the beautiful

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.860
 nature of the mind.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.620
 That really we are going to glorify and rework that. And what is that? That, as I said before, it

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.660
 is joy and appreciation.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.900
 Bodhicata, all living beings, what is bodhicata? Again, it is love, it is compassion. That point to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.540
 everyone, I think, kind of feel that life to break.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 And then also, purely understanding, all the forms are displayed on the way to the form of the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.020
 Buddha Akshobhya mandalas.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.660
 All the sound systems are the matter of the cigarette sound of the Buddha Akshobhya.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 And all what is the mind and the space are also what is the mind of the Buddha Akshobhya.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.040
 So those are really what we are kind of reminded, what we are committed to do and like to keep up

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.700
 there.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.910
 And then we go to our deeper level, this is your nature of the mind, your quality, one's own

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.780
 quality.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.870
 We like to rework more our love and compassion, bring our joy and peace happiness to me or to

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.260
 ourselves, to the other.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.760
 That's what our deep intention, our earning from the heart, so trying to bring up that with our

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.940
 commitment.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.700
 And we then also do, to activate that, do also a little practice.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.420
 Practice is nothing but reminding of our goodness, our good qualities.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.860
 Practice on the Buddha Akshobhya, practice on whatever you practice already.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 Keep those practices and try to also kind of identify our weakness, the errors, the mistakes with

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.940
 that happen.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.780
 Not holding onto that, let that go.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 Let that release and bring up more power of our inner quality of love and compassion and wisdom

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.540
 there.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.760
 Are we able to do that? That is also known as the Buddha's teaching, teaching known as the morality

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.740
 practices.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 That is also known as the practice of the patient practices.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.900
 That is also known as then your effort practices.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.420
 If we keep that concentration, it is this concentration, six paramatta.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.100
 If we see clearly things are as it is, that's the wisdom.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.060
 If we give some time and opportunity to kind of, to effort for that, that's the generous practices.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.060
 So all six paramatta practices, we practice within one single sitting zone, you know, that is.
