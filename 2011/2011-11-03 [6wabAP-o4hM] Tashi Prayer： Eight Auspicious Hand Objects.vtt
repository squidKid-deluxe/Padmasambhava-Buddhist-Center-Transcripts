00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 These are the first folding wall of the GDS.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Those are the wheels, trident, and then short-speed, and then the wager.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 These are the permanent head objects of these four GDS.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 They are powerful, and when they also use that, they are not going to waste that weapon.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 It is like a boom or rain.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 When you shoot that, it hits the target. In fact, it has to be intended, and do the job,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 and it returns back safely in the hands of these GDS.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 So those are the four legs of these head objects.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 He thinks that the story in the Hindu teaching, the story of the GDS,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 let's say that long time ago,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 when the university is just a newly formed,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 or just started newly began forming around that time,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 around that time,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 these all learning algorithms, these GDS,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 gather together, and they don't have the right-hand objects.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And then, these, so then the whole thing in how to do,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 we like to have something so special, but simple and special, good.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 And then we couldn't figure out exactly.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Then there is one sage, Rishi.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Rishi is meditating for so many eons.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 These all bones become as diamond or the wedge.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 These bones are the only one indestructible that is existing in the universe.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 We have all thought these rishis,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 and we have these bones, from the matter of the weapons,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 will be perfect. How we can do that?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 We cannot kill or do anything. He is so powerful.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Nothing that we can do, and all we should not do.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 But this rishi is so kind and so giving,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and he knows what we are thinking, what we will do, use this.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 We will use this weapon only to stop the evil, the bad things in the world.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And therefore, then we should go and ask and tell truly what our intentions are.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So they all went to him and then asked,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 "Can we use your bone as our thinking of plans or wishes?"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And then Rishi thought, and then finally he extracted.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Now he is so powerful, he is so indestructible, how he can be faster.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 There is nothing that can do anything to him, except the cow, cow, holy cow.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So that cow, the cow did it, and the cow licked it to his body.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And during that long time, and then all the flesh was gone, and the skeleton left out.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 So that Rishi gave up his life to have the hand of the offer to his body, to these devotees.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So from that bone, then Ener got vegira, and Shiva got trident,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 and then Rishi got spirit, short spirit, and Narayana.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Narayana got, and then Prama got vegira.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And then at this hand of his, so far for us to say, that they are, they did all the different jobs.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 This was negative evil.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 So that is my story of this hand of his.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Yeah.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Yeah.
