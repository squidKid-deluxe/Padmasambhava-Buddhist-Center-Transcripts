00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.690
 "In any certain people, it is all our disciplines. From what? From this Tathang Gada Garbha.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.140
 Therefore, Tathang Gada Garbha many times, we heard this, we read these books, and teaching we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.000
 heard too.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.700
 Two, is ground of all. Ground of all. All means the evidence, simple way, ground of samsara, ground

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 of niram. All souls of samsara, souls of niram."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.990
 And how is that dharmakaya, or the "Song Gada Garbha", then explain it. That source is, the next

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.000
 one is, primordial enlightened. It's already pure.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.620
 For those reasons, I'm saying this because I'm repeating the teaching as much as I can, can follow

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.000
 it. All is enlightened. That's what the teaching says.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Senkinam Sani Mooji, "Senkinam Sani Mooji laugher tomato." Yet, it's obscured by the obscurations.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 And even there's many times in my sadness, sadness, and bodhicitta. And as we are ordinary Buddha,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.000
 and that way, we know and knows or live like the bodhicitta.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.820
 Those are teachings in ordinary Buddha. But now we are not Buddha, because our mishandled of this

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 nature, call it beautiful, due to the duality and the publications.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.610
 It's not mishandled. We propose it's mishandled due to our ignorance. All reaction to the nature,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.000
 we then create the duality, according to the teaching.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 See, we create. It's just, it's kind of twisted. And then we carry it on that. Then we carry it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 That's it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.810
 So there. And this is how that is, that ordinary nature is, what's called pre-modally enlightened.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.000
 So ordinary enlightened also. That's what many times say.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 Our japat is, our awareness is some of the badder of the awareness. Our japat is japat kundasam. Or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.000
 our kundasam is ordinary kuyu, is a kundasam, or dharmat, kaya, say this.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 And how that is, free from the three doors. Or it has three doors, say. That means what? This

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:55.000
 nature of the dharmakaya is free from the cause, free from the identity, and free from the result.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.130
 It's totally free. And for that reason, what is? Dharmakaya is free from the birth, free from the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.000
 existing, free from the ending.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.680
 Decline or season. Those are known as namtasam. It's all namtasam. In namtasam, it means liberated

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.000
 already. Namtasam means liberated.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.690
 Three different, three liberated states. Liberated states here. Yeah, it's isolated here too. Three

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.000
 liberated states. That's it. It's all right.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.520
 Beacon is liberated, middle is liberated, end is liberated. All past is liberated, present is

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000
 liberated, future is liberated.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.720
 Birth is liberated, existing liberated, end is liberated. Jenga is next to namtasam. So that is

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.000
 really hard.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.900
 So this is what that liberated. It's absolutely great, empty state. That dharmakaya. Dharmakaya, t

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.000
athagatagarbha is total emptiness.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.910
 And then, yeah, that is a symbolic terminology. That is always this tathagatagarbha is tuchu state.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.000
 Tuchu state. Always in the tuchu state. Totally tuchu state.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.060
 Tuchu state. And then it has all the collage of luminicity. That is what, again, as we used,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.000
 essence is empty, nature is luminicity.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.530
 What is that? The absolute experience with the spontaneous display of the three Gaius are united.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.000
 So that is luminicity qualities. That means what? Three Gaius are united in that state.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.560
 Tathangatagarbha, Buddha nature, we're talking now, of course, in a very extended kind of outerly,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.000
 reality, we all have that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.590
 Our nature of the mind, or the ease, always in the tuchu state, or our pure awareness is always in

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.000
 tuchu state.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.640
 Our nature of that pure state of tuchu is always combined, inherited, and reached by the three Gai

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.000
us.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.130
 Tuchu state is naturally open. So three Gaius states, always united. And therefore, then he said, t

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.000
ichu and the rationales manifested their mind, mind inseparable.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.540
 The air here is as a mind, but if I, yeah, mind, the air, but all is the display of the primordial

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.000
 wisdom of the Sagatangarbhas.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.860
 So therefore, as I said, in it, in it, in it, the Yishira, the Hanyakkoh, self-dispelator of the,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.000
 self-dispelator of the rationales of the rationales.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 So it's not something higher in the laws. Equal states. Equal status. And so in separate wisdom.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Therefore, their deeds and aspirations, excellent merits, and so their deeds and their process

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 already in that status, three Gaius states, therefore, then this all is.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.120
 Everything is like a powerful status. So here, the teacher and the rationales manifested their mind

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.000
 in separate status.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.190
 And here, their deeds, their, sorry, their deeds, their aspirations, and excellency, and myself, so

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:10.000
 all is equal, according to one's, glories, glories, glories, glories.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.970
 So here, up to that, so the teacher and his rationales, or here, it says his, teacher and the

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:26.000
 rationales are manifested, manifested in the mind inseparably,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.820
 and what his mind, inseparably, that, that is, up to that is perfect rationalism. I'm trying to

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.000
 explain that, please.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.430
 Now, they're explaining of the perfect time. When the perfect time comes, then, so what's the

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.000
 perfect time?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.590
 There, the deeds and aspirations, excellent merits. Merits mean that is, that is time, perfect time

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:05.000
. That means the merit or the situation and the circumstances of everything is really, really.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.550
 That readiness is, I'm taking as perfect time. That readiness, so that means the perfect place is

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:21.180
 there, the perfect teacher is there, the perfect rational is there, and that, the situation, the

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:29.420
 circumstances, and all that is aspiration, everything is there, and that is perfect time, perfect

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.000
 time.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.650
 And for that is not myself and the spirit of others, equal portion one's glory is, glory, so, the

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:51.710
 myself and the spirit of others, equal portion, eros, so eros, eros, that is, that indicated time,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.000
 perfect time.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.820
 The situation, the circumstances, eros, perfect, that is the perfect time, time to ex form of these

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.000
 teachings.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.020
 Then, here mentioned, mentioned, some of those who are not ready to this, then it is not really

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.000
 right time to share this, this teaching, if they are not ready.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.990
 So that is like, as we put the questions, if everything is ready, perfect, then teachings arise,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:32.000
 but if certain ones are not completely ready, what is that? Then what?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And this generally in the Buddha teaching says, that everyone has opportunity, it's not just a...
