00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Yesterday you talked about opening the mandala when we did Vajrayana practice. What are we opening

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 to? Is it like the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:36.240
 Yalaya, or Rigpa, or the world of invisible beings? All of them! But generally it is the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.200
 ceremonial in the sadhana, Vajrayana sadhana ceremony, and when we did this Vajrayana ceremony,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 these all practices are summarized into two categories that you all know, visualization,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:02.120
 meditation, and completion meditation, two meditations. So when we do the sadhana, this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.920
 visualization, that means we are now going to begin to emanate the display of the primordial,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 our own awareness, and many beautiful, wonderful displays. And so that means that now we begin to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.430
 open the mandala. So the mandala of the display of the deity or the Buddha, all that really begins

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:44.360
 open, that's the opening. Okay. Yes, yes. Yes, Rampashe. I have a question about karma. So as we

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.480
 get on in life, as we get older, we begin to see that we didn't do everything perfectly, and we

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.640
 begin to think that there were occasions where, and we know there were occasions where we did not

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.800
 do

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.040
 the best for other people, that we may not have helped them as we should have, that we may have

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.420
 actually misrepresented ourselves to them in terms of our relationship with them, and as a result

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.650
 feel that we have accumulated karma. What should we do about that? Well, that is generally

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.320
 wonderful

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:40.200
 to recognize. Seeing that is really, number one, the best, is the best. Many times how we do, we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.520
 all,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.280
 we ignore. Even somebody reminds us we get immediately upset. You say, "Oh, you're criticizing

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.680
 me. You're accusing me that. You're insulting me that." We're trying to block that, kind of to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.000
 shield up to our whatever that mistakes. Really, we do that many times. We're trying to kind of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.680
 depending that instead, "Oh, that is true. I should do this." So when we recognize, it's so

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.160
 wonderful. Number one is really recognize, reconnections. Once we recognize that, then

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.280
 such as many different ways to purify that, and such as then practice of the Vedya Sattva,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.800
 according to the teaching that says, and those are then in the teaching said, "poor powers."

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.640
 Power of the visualization of the meditation on the Vedya Sattva, and the power of the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.600
 recognitions. Recognize that. And the power of the uprooting, that I'm going to really clean that.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.640
 At the same time, they're known as the power of the commitment that I'm not going to repeat that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 again. And by the blessings of the Buddhas and all that, may I never repeat that again. Had those

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.720
 poor powers in the teaching said, "If you have the poor power, apply that with the practices,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.280
 practices, meditation, even as huge, as big as a mountain, it will really clean up in the teaching

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.400
 said that." And there's so many stories that, I mean, the Buddha's teaching, you're in the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.920
 example, Arya Chaturv, the one who really did bad karma, that he killed his own father, father,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.080
 kings. And then he also disturbed the Sangha members. Sangha members are generally known as

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.000
 group of the harmony and peace and respect and appreciation. But if you really smile at that,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.480
 again a group, is one of the worst karmas that you can do. And one of the worst karmas is also

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.960
 known as

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 the killing of one's own parents and many. And Arya Chaturv did this, this, and as well as,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.630
 although he's trying to kill the Buddha too. But once he really recognized that he's, that mistakes

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640
,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.040
 all that, he came to the Buddha and he said that, "I've had terrible mistakes and all these things,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.720
 so what I do?" And then he believed that what Buddha taught all the teachings and practices,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.440
 and then he purified according to teaching that. He really purified that. So those are the examples

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.040
 of that. But number one is, among the four powers, number one is to recognize that is so important.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.240
 Okay. Thank you, Rinpoche. Thank you.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.280
 For what's called recognize or acknowledge our, yeah, acknowledge.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:50.120
 Rinpoche, thank you so much for coming. Oh, thank you. There are thousands of teachers

00:05:50.120 --> 00:06:01.080
 just in the United States and then many more teachings. And there are teachers, of course,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:10.840
 who are not the Buddha. Is it a mistake to look at a teacher who is not the Buddha as the Buddha?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.840
 Is it a mistake to look at a teacher as a Buddha when he's not?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:27.960
 That is, it depends. Every you have, it depends individually. Every you have really strong

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.520
 devotions. It's a question about the devotions. Every you have the strong devotion,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:47.240
 then sing as a teacher, sing teacher as a Buddha. Then it's okay. It's okay. But otherwise,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:57.160
 always do the intellectual way. Intellectual way, exam the teacher and teachers' activity,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:06.120
 teachers' teaching, and follow the teaching. So what do we get? If we follow the intellectual way,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:15.000
 what the gracious teacher Buddha Shakyamuni said, "Don't trust on the person, but trust on the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.800
 teaching." So, trust on the teaching. But teaching also, don't trust teaching on the world, W-O-R-D

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.800
,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:39.640
 but trust on the meaning of the world. And also, not just trust the meaning of the relative level,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.560
 but the meaning of the absolute level. Trust on the meaning of the absolute level. And not just

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:56.520
 trust, also when you realize trust on the absolute level, not just trusting on the conceptual level

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.520
,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:06.440
 but trying to, I'm not trying, trust on the non-conceptual way. Those are the more intellectual

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:14.040
 way. And that is the very good approach. Approach and stable. Then once you really develop the

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.680
 strong

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:24.520
 devotion and that, then you can have the teacher as a Buddha. But it's developed a good,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:34.040
 strong confidence and good practices. And relying on the Dharma or the symbol to rely on the Dharma

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:41.400
 is more important than relying on the individualist. Thank you.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.880
 Yes, yes.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:54.600
 Rempoche, you and many great masters have often said, "Each Buddha contains all other Buddhas,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.880
 each wisdom contains all wisdoms." But this question is about the five Dhyani Buddhas and

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.840
 Buddha families. So, we who have taken refuge in this lineage, all are members of the Pema family.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:14.200
 We have Dharma names that are Pema, this and that. So, my smallest question is,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.520
 I've never heard the word Dhyani translated. Is it possible to translate? If so, what's a good

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:30.280
 translation? Dhyani translated as in Tibet or in India? I think it's a family.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:39.320
 Ah, all right. Thank you. And secondly, is it as simple as all Nyingma lineage practitioners

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.760
 are members of the Pema family, all Kagus or Karma, or is it not quite that simple?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.760
 No, no, no. That is, I mean, there could be, but it's not exactly that way. Pema family,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:01.800
 as you said, in the teachings, said that generally all Buddhas are because they

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.080
 contains all other Buddhas. What that actually really means, that each of Buddhas,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:19.480
 the nature is all Buddhas, nature of their wisdoms. And not just only all the Buddhas,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.760
 even our nature of the mind is the nature of all the Buddhas. What that also means,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.680
 what is the nature of the Buddha? The nature of the Buddha is loving kindness,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:40.280
 compassion, and wisdoms. That is really the nature of the Buddhas. That is really

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:47.080
 the ultimate state of the Buddhas. So our love, our compassion, our wisdom, not disturbed by the

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:53.640
 duality, is the nature of the enlightenment. That enlightenment of the Buddhas, that's why

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:03.560
 gracious teacher, Buddha, said that every living being has the same potential or the nature as I do

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:03.560
.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:13.080
 Do that. So therefore, all that. So now, Pema family, for example, Pema family is,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.880
 in the Pema family level, Pema family in Bodhim and all five Dhyana Buddhas.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:24.040
 Pema family is not just a Pema family, but Pema family of the Buddha family.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:33.000
 Pema family of the Carma family, Pema family of the Rena family, Pema family,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.040
 family of the Pema family, Pema family of the Karma families. So within the five,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:49.240
 Pema family is in Bodhim and all five Dhyana Buddhas, or not just all the Buddhas.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.560
 So that's really how it is. But then again, highlighted, represented that highway,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:05.640
 and then Amitabha represented more Pema family, and Vijay Sattva represented more

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.800
 Vijay family, Rena Samba represented more Rena family, and so forth. Those are just

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.600
 highlighted status, but reality level is really the same nature. They all represent all.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.920
 Thank you.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.680
 Okay, thank you.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.120
 Come on, remember Shain?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.760
 Yes, yes.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.120
 There we go.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.920
 Yep.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.680
 Thank you. I consider this to be a really tough question, and it pertains to daily practice.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:43.640
 If you look in the root text on page 21…

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:52.040
 Okay, thank you. Again, if you can…

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.000
 I could read the sentence.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.240
 No, because please read that mean it a bit.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.280
 Oh, it's a bit…

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:12.920
 Oh, wow.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.040
 Arigato.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.640
 The statement that I can see…

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I looked a bit… Because my English, I mean, I'm speaking English,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.240
 but still my English is not really…

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.880
 Oh, I hear it, Marianne.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.400
 Not…

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.160
 21, the first new paragraph.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.040
 Okay, thank you.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.680
 Thank you.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.600
 Yeah, thank you.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.440
 Yeah, now you're still, please.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.440
 Yeah, now you're safe.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.440
 To enter the path of Dharma, it is not enough to adopt its outer appearances.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:06.200
 We have to sever all ties to desirable things and to activities limited to this life.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.360
 I think that's a…

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.720
 I believe that's a tough one.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.880
 I think I underestimated that one.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.000
 I think it is a piece of a case, if you can do.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.400
 If you can do.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.200
 Exactly.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.560
 Piece of a case.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.280
 Perfect response. I'm just going to point out that it does make it difficult

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.160
 to be a bodhisattva and to go into a cave and live for 30 years.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.720
 But I accept the answer. If you can do it, it is a piece of cake.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.560
 And I thank you very much for that wisdom.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.560
 Thank you, sir.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.720
 No, but this is, of course, as you said, this is tough.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.040
 Definitely tough to everyone.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.520
 But it's not something that we're going to eliminate immediately.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.800
 We can do this.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:00.040
 But we're going to keep the courage and the commitment and our kind of like destination.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.640
 Keep this our goal.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.720
 So we're going to work continually on this again and again.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:13.720
 And gradually, our attachment, the unhealthy attachment, transform me to the good attachment

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.040
 that love and kindness and compassion and joy and appreciation.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:25.800
 And then the power of death, then this unnecessary, those old kind of mundane,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.400
 mundane, very unhealthy attachment that we really do.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.600
 And that will be eliminated and develop more and more.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.440
 More than this, the good attitude, good qualities.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.310
 And then that when that happened, then it transformed all that into when you meditate in the

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:47.720
 practice.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.600
 It transformed into then the equanimity status.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.360
 Equanimity status.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.440
 So then we don't really have to be concerned with this and that thing.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.640
 It's kind of like back and forth, back and forth.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:08.680
 But all is just our mind, is nothing else.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:16.040
 And our mind is the nature, as the teaching mentioned, is emptiness, openness,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.400
 is just fullness, infinite, freedom status.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.400
 So then we don't have to court too much on this status.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.680
 So that is what really is explaining that.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:32.520
 But at the beginning of the time, we should try to keep really courage and strong

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.800
 so that we don't court always with this unnecessary mundane attachment,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.280
 bonding this situation.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.640
 That's what it really means.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.300
 Yes?

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.400
 In the practice of the Prajna Paramita, in the Heart Chakra,

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.560
 when we're talking about all things being emptiness,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.800
 when in your practice and when you realize that all things are emptiness

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.560
 and you find that center and you learn to let go,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.640
 does that help all karma be dissipated?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.080
 Oh, definitely.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.400
 There's a dukti meditation or the Pandya Paramata meditation

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.440
 is the one of the most powerful way to cleanse and the obscuration is karma.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.760
 It's really in the teachings.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.840
 Even some great in the teaching mentioned that if you meditate even a short time,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.960
 like for one or two, three minutes, there's a completely unknown duality status,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.320
 that will clean so many obscurations.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.320
 And really in the teaching said that.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.440
 That is so powerful.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.400
 So that is excellent.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.240
 It will cleanse and purify.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.920
 We need to cleanse the purify.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.840
 What it comes up, comes up more loving kindness,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.760
 more compassion, more joy and more appreciation,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.960
 more courage and a commitment, more patience, and then really grows.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:13.640
 Also, all the beautiful gala of the inner nature of the natural mind will shine so beautifully.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.480
 And all those disturbance of the mental state is kind of fading away.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.560
 That's about this practice.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.880
 And then the same time that all the karma that are also really fading away or clay away.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.200
 Thank you, Rinpoche.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.560
 Okay.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.040
 Thank you.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.280
 Harupoche, I have a question for you this morning.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.120
 Thank you for being here.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.880
 I just wanted to show some appreciation and gratitude for

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.680
 learning from everyone and everybody being so kind.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.200
 It's an amazing way to start the day.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.600
 My question is on meditation.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:58.440
 Do you have, I guess some good advice on calming an incredibly overactive mind?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.040
 Because when I meditate sometimes after I'm done, I feel so frustrated when I just can't...

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.040
 It seems like I'm trying to tame a wild horse that I have no control over.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.600
 And then other days, it's very productive.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.040
 But lately, you know, so do you have any good advice for really how to tame a horse?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.880
 That really happened to everyone.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.800
 Not just you or somebody, particularly in the beginning time.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:30.440
 For that is, the first is, first is really the mostly important, bring good attitudes.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:39.000
 For example, when you sit down on the cushion or on the chair, bring up more joy and appreciation.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.000
 Just for few seconds, few seconds.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.560
 And when you do that, what I will do?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.000
 It will really unnecessarily thought well, those old busyness, turbulence.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.520
 Well, calm down.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.760
 Then more also love and kindness compare thoughts.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.040
 Reaching good things for all living beings and include, of course,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.800
 yourself to really good wishes.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.080
 Reaching that for a short time.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.040
 Again, that is one of the very powerful way to calm down.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.880
 That busyness, that wild horse to bring down, really down there.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.640
 And then after that, feel strong.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:25.960
 If you feel close, if it's okay with you, comfortable with you, feel very close with the Buddha.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.800
 Buddha, all that, right in front, Buddha is meditating.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.280
 Meditating, sitting down, right in front of you.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.400
 You feel.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.560
 And the Buddha is so calm.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.920
 So peaceful.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.880
 So soothing.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.480
 So calming.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:49.320
 Emanating love with that energy of love or kindness or compassion.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.240
 Calming down peace that to you and to all the beings.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:00.120
 You're in a kind of almost that serenity, that in the sunshine of the bundled up within that state.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.640
 It's so warm and light.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.560
 And it's sitting there.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:11.000
 And then if you need something else, else with that, and then maybe focus some small object

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.680
 or some mental object to right there or just hold that mental image.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.960
 Something concentrated on that for like two, three minutes.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.840
 Those, that all will calm down.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.760
 Calm down, it will really calm down what it does.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.600
 Then mind is reaching to its own natural status.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.200
 Its own kind of ground status.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.800
 So those are the dead.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.360
 Do that, meditate, sitting that way for whatever your time.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.680
 And also, kind of again, activate a good thought, intention.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.000
 Bring more joy and appreciation.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.960
 More compassion thought for the old, everyone's, for even two seconds or for one minute.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.560
 And then it's good.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.760
 And then that, clearly that energy, I mean, when you're in the world once in a while,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.160
 throughout the day, don't completely forget.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.880
 And that is really great mindfulness.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.880
 And it always bring back to your home.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.680
 Home, sweet home.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:23.800
 Thank you so much, Rinpoche.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:31.720
 So as we close this season, we are so grateful that we have had you sitting here

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.880
 and we picture you here and we carry you with us.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.360
 But I really mean this question quite sincerely.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:47.720
 What is special about group practice when the teacher is not able to be here?

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.920
 You know, that we carry on all year, even when you're not here.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.240
 And we offer our group practices.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.880
 And I know there are many practical reasons.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:05.560
 But for our development, are there special reasons to come and practice as a Sangha?

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:14.600
 According to the teaching, according to lineage, the group practice is so powerful.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:23.800
 And what is called three jewels, Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.160
 And the Buddha, I think you all know.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.760
 Dharma, you all know.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.840
 Sangha means group, harmonious group.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:39.000
 Sangha, of course, is what we call one individual Sangha members.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.280
 But really to make Sangha is group, gindin, means group.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.680
 Sangha means group.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.120
 So what in the teaching you say that?

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.720
 You have the four individuals practicing together.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.040
 That is known as Sangha, noble Sanghas.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.560
 Practice.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.200
 They are all meditating and practicing.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.880
 One person is good.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.960
 Two person is good.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.920
 But four people individually are practicing together.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.960
 That becomes really the true Sangha members.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.000
 And then in the teaching you say that also

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.360
 one Sangha member, whatever the realization has that, is one.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.720
 But if you have two, add two.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.000
 If you have three, add three.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Add four, then add four.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.920
 So then it becomes one dollar.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:49.080
 Otherwise it's just a quarter, which is important, of course, important quarter.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.120
 And one stick, in the teaching you say that one broom,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.320
 and now maybe here we are coming and all those things.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:05.480
 But broom, of course, is how to clean the room in ancient times by broom.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.720
 Brooming.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.880
 But one is not broom.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.400
 But one that stick is not important.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.200
 It's not going to clean so much.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.560
 But if it's true, three, four is joined, then it becomes really broom.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.840
 Then really you can clean.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.360
 You can clean.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.640
 So according to the teaching, if you gather all that Sangha members get together

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.960
 and practice harmony peacefully, it's really very powerful.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.360
 It's very powerful.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.440
 And that's called helping to each other, support to each other,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.000
 inspire to each other, and learn from to each other, and grow.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.720
 And deep or deepening.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.680
 Thank you.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.960
 Okay, thank you.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.840
 Then we stop here.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.320
 I think so.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 Okay, then yeah, thank you.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.680
 Thank you, Rinpoche.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.440
 Thank you for a beautiful question to bring us all together as a group practicing continuously.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.160
 Rinpoche, I have this question about the union of

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.960
 primordial purity and spontaneous presence.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.840
 The union of primordial purity and spontaneous presence.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:30.520
 So the primordial purity is about the Dhamma Kaya state.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.680
 And the spontaneous presence is more like Rupa Kaya,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:47.240
 which is the Buddhist compassion, loving kindness, spontaneously presence, like a near-Mana Kaya

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:47.560
 state

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.920
 to help people, beings, according to the need.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.320
 Is that what is the spontaneous presence?

00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:04.280
 Yeah, I mean, I think this primordial quality of the awareness is Dhamma Kaya.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.040
 And then it has naturally inherited.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:15.960
 And then the energy, the energy of quality is then Rupa Kaya as true.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.920
 And which is love and kindness and compassion.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:26.280
 So actually that, but then as in the teaching named many times as Rupa Kaya.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.720
 So that is like Rupa Kaya then can be divided into two.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.720
 And Sambo Kaya and then Nirmaka Kaya.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.960
 Nirmaka Kaya, both are Rupa Kaya.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:49.880
 Kaya, both are display of the energy of the primordial awareness, which is Dhamma Kaya.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.240
 I think that's your question, right?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:57.320
 Rinpoche, so the understanding of spontaneous presence, spontaneous presence.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.040
 So the spontaneous practice.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.520
 Presence.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.840
 Spontaneous presence.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.440
 In the book, sometimes we say.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.960
 They say calling love of power.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.880
 Oh, where is that?

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.720
 The book, sometimes we talk about this primordial purity and the spontaneous presence.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:24.840
 Oh yeah, but primordial, I mean, and that is attention, if I understand that.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.840
 Primordial nature, primordial, what do you say?

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.920
 Primordial purity.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.360
 Primordial purity.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.920
 Primordial purity, I think it's generally the nature of the mind.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.160
 Our nature of the mind is primordial purity status.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:49.960
 Is nobody purified or purified and nobody diluted is purity status.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.280
 So that is like as a Dhamma Kaya or the purity status.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.760
 Spontaneously present.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.360
 What is that present?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.280
 The richness call, it is a spontaneously right there.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:08.600
 There is not just a came later or going to come upward.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.800
 Is it right there?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.920
 So therefore, is it called, and you didn't match the effort to come to all things.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.280
 So therefore, is it?

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.120
 Spontaneously presented, presented.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:26.040
 And if I add one more mode, spontaneously presented qualities.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:33.800
 That is not something that you search or came later, but is already there.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:40.920
 Yeah, it says the spontaneous presence of the five certainties is what you are talking about.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.280
 That's what you are talking?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.400
 So Rinpoche, the spontaneous presence, that's the quality of a Buddha

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.880
 once would become enlightened, so that quality is right there as being spontaneous presence

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.160
 to help beings.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:01.400
 That is a like this person, a spontaneously presented call.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.720
 It is the Buddha's call.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.480
 It is enlightenment call.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.280
 It is not something dribble up.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.520
 But according to teaching, Buddha's realization, the call.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.920
 It is begin to shine as we purify our mistakes.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.040
 It begin to shine again and again.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.440
 The ordinary nature is there, but we made mistakes.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.120
 And now we have to clear way.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.760
 As much as we clear way, that much is begin to shine.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.640
 Maybe it looks like developing, but reality is not developing.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:51.000
 Sun is already in the sky, but when the cloud and thick cover is covered,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 then we don't see, but as much light in the cloud or the mysteries, sun begin to shine,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.040
 but that means it comes newly.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.320
 It is already there, but conditions are clearing way.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.000
 And because that's what the really teaching mentioned.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.760
 Thank you.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.360
 Okay, so that's okay.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.800
 Yeah, one more, then we stop.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.960
 Okay, two more, then we stop.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.480
 And three more, we stop.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.200
 And four more, we stop.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.720
 Okay, yeah.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:27.160
 Kimpo, many years ago, one time you were describing a feminine deity.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.760
 Feminine?

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.760
 A feminine, feminine deity, female deity.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.040
 And you were saying that she was so beautiful, like a runway model.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.960
 That you never felt like you've looked enough, you can stop now.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.160
 You just wanted to keep looking.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:51.320
 Okay, now, several years ago, I was driving you on a Sunday back to Madara House.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.120
 And we were doing a purification practice.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.600
 And probably at the end for two, three, four minutes, I don't know how long,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.440
 everyone in the room kept repeating the syllable of hung, hung, hung.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.280
 And I remember when we got in the car, I said to you that I love doing that.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:20.120
 And I told you that at the time I was working in downtown Miami in a very wealthy financial

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.080
 district, and there were all these very, very beautiful women in the neighborhood.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:32.200
 And I said, my sort of inner 14 year old would jump out and would want to look for the most

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.320
 attractive woman I could see and get lost in it.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.600
 And I told you that by doing practicing hung, I was a bit freer of that,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.560
 and could let other impressions come in as well.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:53.080
 And then the third thing, I learned that Dungham Rinpoche had 11 children.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.680
 Seven from his first marriage, four from his second.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:03.960
 So my question finally is, what part does sexual energy play in, say,

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:11.560
 generating bodhicitta, maintaining it, intensifying it, and waking up in the journey of

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.360
 enlightenment?

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.400
 So that's my question.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.560
 I think probably I'm not alone with that question.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.440
 Of course, it's quite, quite long.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:31.320
 But the desire, the sexual energy or the desire of the enlightenment,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.880
 such as his only Dungham Rinpoche's is not really desired as ours,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:44.280
 or many, many individualism, or many normal beings, beings.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.880
 They see that is in the teaching field.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.000
 I'm not just talking about only the his own Dungham Rinpoche,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.640
 but his own Dungham Rinpoche is considered one of the very highly realizing beings,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:01.960
 that. So therefore, for that highly enlightened realization beings,

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:11.240
 that desire is, even though they appear as desires, but they don't have grasping,

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.400
 clinging on that, it's just display.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:22.200
 Therefore, that attachment or that is nothing, any negatives,

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.480
 because it's not really any attachment, nothing, any grasping.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.680
 So then what is it?

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:37.320
 That is like invoking the inner call of the blessfulness and helping and activating that

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.160
 realization more and more, or more deepening that.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.400
 So that's what really in the teaching said that.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.960
 Okay. Thank you, Lotus.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.880
 Thank you.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.280
 I was thinking about the question that Chris asked.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.200
 Thank you for asking the question, Chris.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:02.920
 The importance of the Sangha together, practicing together.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:12.120
 And I think it's very important because I feel there is an incredible energy,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:18.040
 practiced together with an open heart, not just to love each other.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.280
 I mean, we love each other, help each other.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.400
 But there is an energy that I cannot touch.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.520
 But when I practice during the week with the group, I leave the center.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.520
 It's like a good drug.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.880
 It's a good attraction.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:40.520
 It's an incredible, I don't have words to explain it, but it's an incredible energy

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.560
 when we're here and we practice together.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.400
 So that energy, I don't think it's, you can't touch it.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.320
 Yeah, but this is really true.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:56.200
 A court really teaching, a court teaching, Sangha member practice a target with harmoniously,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.080
 peacefully, love and compassion.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.200
 Really, I mean, it's so powerful, so special in the teaching.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.320
 It's really good.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.160
 For example, I mean, we joined.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.520
 May all living beings have the happiness, cause happiness.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.840
 How many people are saying that?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.880
 How many people are thinking in this world, there's billions and billions of people.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.960
 They said, but how many people are saying that?

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.800
 We're really saying that.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.600
 We mean that.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.200
 May all living beings have the happiness and the cause of happiness.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.360
 May every living being is free from suffering and the cause of suffering.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:37.080
 We're not talking, oh, may all our group have the happiness and the cause of happiness.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.600
 We're not discriminating anything this and that.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.800
 Now, our love and compassion is pervasive as the sky.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.120
 Sky, saying that, I mean, it's not just,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.280
 because we do this prayer, can't we become normal, casual, kind of like that.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.480
 But reality level is so precious, so powerful, so nugget.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:05.400
 And when we joined that target, the guru, oh, got more, what's called, oh gosh, oh gosh.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:13.880
 That ripple energy, that invisible energy is swinging really, according to teaching.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.520
 Teaching is going. It's part of the, really the practice of the bodhic.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.200
 That's what the Buddha taught.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.320
 Then we relax and calm and peaceful.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.360
 What we're not saying, oh, I'm the great, I'm the best, this, we're not.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.840
 We're relaxing, calming down, everything.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:38.760
 Relax in the naturals, just so ordinary, so simple, so basic.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.520
 Down to the earth, completely, really, nothing bumpy, this and that, clashing. So powerful.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.000
 So, I mean, it is really powerful, according to teaching.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.040
 That's why it cleans and purify all those, so it becomes really beautiful.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.720
 It benefits to us, it benefits to other beings,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.760
 and that's the one thing that's great we can do in our lives.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.480
 Of course, we can do a lot of beautiful things in life,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.840
 but we'd kind of like to touch our really cold heart.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.440
 Such we can do, and do together.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.160
 And then, of course, individually, also keep that up.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.120
 It's just really wonderful and beautiful.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.360
 That's what it is also in the teachings too.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.120
 Okay, thank you, thank everyone.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.320
 Thank you, thank you very much, everyone coming and participating.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.720
 Thank again, thank you.
