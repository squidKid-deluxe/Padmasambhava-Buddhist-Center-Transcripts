00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 Good evening everyone again. Good evening. Thank you for coming and welcome. Thank you so much.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.600
 I also am honored and privileged right in front of you in talking about that big culture,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.960
 cultural and art and I'm very really proud of this. I'm so honored and thankful. Thank

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.440
 for all the help and support by so many Sangha members here in the West Palm Beach and Florida

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.960
 area and as well as in the New York and the area and so many people for supporting the help to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.880
 activate it to both this beautiful, magnificent show, the exhibitions, which represent the loving

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.480
 kindness and compassion, respect and appreciation for all living beings. I'm so happy and really

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 delighted with these shows. And as well as also to have this opportunity, I'd like to thank

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:05.040
 to Diane and the reverence of this the United Church and as well as also congregation as members

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 of everyone to allow us to show have these exhibitions. So I really thank you for that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 without your help and even we have all these things we cannot really bring up here. So

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.480
 I'm so thankful, so grateful to all of your support, help to every aspect. So without that,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 again as I said we cannot happen this. And now I talk really about the art, art and culture.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.040
 Generally art and culture is the very beautiful treasure, the human value or treasure of the human

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.120
 beings in every different country. Every different country has beautiful art, beautiful culture,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.720
 beautiful heritage and they all generally basically very similar everyone but even though

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.310
 it's similar it has very its own unique qualities, unique qualities, special status and that's how

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.320
 makes really distinctly beautiful things even though it's very similar things. So I talk a little

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.480
 bit

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.400
 about how that within the art and then of course it's connected with the culture so also art how

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 they how they kind of their philosophy how they they think that I will talk a little bit about that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 and after that maybe you have some questions I like to kind of share and discuss or answer

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.600
 that if you have some questions when you saw the exhibition and maybe you're thinking what

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 must be maybe what what maybe this is. So if you have some questions I'm very happy. So first I

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.280
 talk a little bit about the art, art and then we have some discussions that so what about now the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.480
 art, generally in the the community they say the art can be divided in three different arts,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 something that is connected with the physical and connected with verbal and connected with mind.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.200
 So that means what? It says art of the physical, art of the verbal or the vocal and art of the mind

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.200
.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.480
 So this is what generally I kind of way explaining or the way we see things. So everything is there

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.720
's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.000
 art, three arts. So that means art, body, speech or the verbal and mind. So three different art

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.600
 and then each of those has also two different arts. So one is connected with generally only worldly

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.640
 fa art and something where is connected more reverent connected with spiritual. Spiritual means

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.480
 love and kindness, compassion, respect and appreciation. So some symbol in the monument

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.640
 of love and kindness, compassion, those are like spiritual or in debate we called dharma. It's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.520
 connected with dharma. So there is two different kind of arts and what are personally art of the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.880
 physical. Art of the physical is something connected with the physical such as a statues,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.320
 all those statues, statues and a drawing of the physical. So those all are known as the art of

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.520
 the body, art of the physical connected. And art of the physical connected also can be like as

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:31.440
 statues or as casted statues as drawing, painting. Those are art of the physical. Each of those has

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 also different expressions. Expression of the passionate, expression of the very kind of like

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.400
 rough and wrathful, expression of a very pathetic and a very subathetical. So explaining that kind

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.320
 of carrying that playable and showing that if those art best artists really can express their

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:02.080
 kind of emotion, their thought into that statues or the paintings or light drawings or cast. And

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.400
 such

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.200
 as I think that maybe one of the best examples of that in the in the modern time in western country

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:19.520
 such as work. Monolysis, smile of monolysis, explaining that kind of beauty of the very gentle

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.960
 and essential expression of the of that smiling such as monolysis. Those are known as the all art

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.720
 art experience which is connected with physicals. And then verbal arts are such as all the tunes,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.840
 musics and all the vocal activities. Those are also connected with many different

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:53.600
 expressions of such as like again very soothing, calming, frightening, frightening mood and as well

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.320
 as very subathetical voice. Also it captures again emotion, it captures of the heart and the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.720
 mind of the others. This suddenly you really feel that kind of meaning behind what they

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.720
 try to explain that. And those are known as in it according to Vedin. It's all the art of the

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.520
 voice. And then art of the mind is something really connected with imaginations. All the different

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.360
 imaginations such as everything activated what we do most of the time comes from the mind. So mind

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.880
 is the initiative source of every art that comes. Also you can't really visualize that in the mind

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.600
 and then it reflected on the form. So therefore all those are known as then mental

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.640
 art and then mental activity can be divided according Buddhism. Then also those meditations,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.800
 mindfulness activities and such as the visualizations. So you meditate and you kind of

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.200
 visualize different things and kind of like transforming that environment of that individual

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.960
 into the same as you see. You are experienced in early that and that is again all those artists

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.160
 best upon this mental art. It's best upon love and compassion, kindness, joy and respect and

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.840
 appreciation, honest and truthful. Those are known as really about the art. And as I said already

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.840
 those all pre-art that can be divided into two sections. One is a very regularly general worldly

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.480
 kind of worldly art, other is spiritual or Dharma art that can be divided. And then we then that

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.680
 also can be divided as a male and a female and a different people support. So that is really kind

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:51.760
 of like overview of the idea of the art in it a bit. It comes. And now I talk a little bit really

00:07:51.760 --> 00:08:00.160
 about the this this art of the related with the Dharma that in it. Generally there's all these

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.040
 both arts, regular worldly art and as well as related with the Dharma or the spiritual. But most

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.520
 of the time in the Tibetan becomes one of the very spiritually connected countries on the earth.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.800
 And therefore mostly arts are all really connected with Buddhism. Mostly there's something

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.360
 connected

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:29.920
 with the loving kind, compassion, joy, respect and appreciations and kind of courage and commitment

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:37.120
 and to preserve it. This your identity your call it of love and compassion how to reflect that all

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.840
 really what it is. So basically kind of mostly is like this. But however again I talk a little bit

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:52.080
 really about how the Buddhists started art. Begin with how Buddhist art particularly suggests as a

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.640
 physical art. And that is always goes back to the Buddha's time. The first Buddha statue according

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:06.480
 to Buddhist history it came in the journey the Buddha's time his lifetimes. They made first time

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.080
 Buddha statues. It is story says that one Buddha reach enlightenment become the Buddha. Buddha and

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.440
 after maybe about 10 years after the Buddha's Mahaprabhu, no sorry not Mahaprabhu, when Buddha

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.920
 reach

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:29.360
 enlightenment. Enlightenment and there is very famous king in central India is called the Magadha's

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:37.520
 Magadha in the central India Magadha. Country of the Magadha. The king of that country is known as

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:46.480
 as Bimbisara. Bimbisara very famous powerful king in that times. Also his capital was known as

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:55.440
 Rajagiri's. Rajagiri's one of the very civilized country in that time on this earth according to

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:03.600
 the teaching. Everything, cultural, music, art, and festivities. Everything, language, and art,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.920
 mathematics, and in every geometry, and science, and everything really exists in that countries.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.720
 And the king of that country is known as Bimbisara's. And that time there is also another king in

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:18.800
 the

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:27.680
 east of India. India is now modern time maybe known as the west of Bengal or in Bengal or in Orissa

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:27.840
.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.880
 It's kind of called the east of India. And there is one king known as Dado king. King. King.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:48.000
 Dado king is called Tengado. This king Dado and as well as Bimbisara

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.800
 they become very good friends with corresponding. They never met each other but through the

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 corresponding they really become one of the best friends. Each of them they started sending

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:10.160
 best gifts to each other. It is through the messages. This Dado king sent, King Dado sent

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:21.940
 to the Bimbisara a very precious jewel, jewel armor to king. Very beautiful. In the teaching he

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.320
 said

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:32.080
 priceless jewel, jewel he sent, armor to send. So when the Bimbisara king, the Magadha king

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.800
 received that when he saw that he was so excited and happy. He's impressed by the gift but his same

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.760
 time he was worried. So what I can send to him is such a great king. Now he sent such a priceless

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:54.080
 armor to me or the armor, right? Armor and I don't have any kind of gift like this. What do I do?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.360
 He was kind of like very worried. And the ministers said great king looks like you're very worried

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.160
 what's happening. And he said because this friend, my friend sent the gift such a great gift

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.480
 these things he showed this priceless gift but I don't have any equivalent gift to send to him.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:25.520
 This minister said don't worry. I think really you send the photo or the painting of the Buddha,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:35.040
 Buddha and ask to gracious teacher Buddha, Buddha and make that, ask him to make that. He let him

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:43.600
 to do that painting. Yeah, painting. So then Bimbisara, he was very devoted to the Buddha,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.920
 King Bimbisara and he went to the Buddha and asked if he can make that. So then Buddha said yes.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:57.840
 So when he started drawing the light kind of like as drawing in the teaching said that artist when

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:57.920
 he

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.360
 were looking to the Buddha as a physical, they couldn't bear because the Buddha is glowing so

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 much glowing radiating that couldn't really look directly. So there of course the Buddha you will

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:18.720
 well you come to the near the pond and reflect the image to the to the pond and then from the

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:29.360
 pond then they will draw. So then that's what they did draw the Buddha reflection of the Buddha's

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:38.240
 body to the pond from the water and then they they they draw they draw and they made the painting.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:46.720
 And so that represent the first time Buddha see like image in art and then target with that

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.760
 Buddha when he created that also Buddha wrote some teachings, teachings explaining of the

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:01.200
 12 interdependent links and this is a very famous Buddhist in the Buddhist the essential philosophy

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.160
 is everything is connected to there's an if there's no connections and no kind of like

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:13.600
 corporations things won't going to happen. Anything you see on this earth has so many

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:21.120
 cores and so many conditions so many different kind of like support in on right on the front

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:29.520
 and behind combination of all that makes then whatever you see you can see and this is called

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:36.000
 known as interdependent coordination or interdependent linkage. And without that

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.520
 there's nothing really going to see. So Buddha image and as well as some orders with that

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:52.240
 teaching that put on this toga with the image and he's wrapped so beautiful with his silk and then

00:14:52.240 --> 00:15:01.440
 send that to the to the as a person to the king dado dado king and he told the police he received

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.160
 this with great honor honor and this so he posed the king dado thought what does this means

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:15.360
 great honor he is in a way to to honor to the gift that made them in a way almost

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.120
 a kind of insulting me kind of he feel very upset in a way that but then second he thought

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.520
 I shouldn't maybe upset what's the rest I will see what it is when he saw he then he began to

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.360
 look to the open the gift and he saw the Buddha image and moment he opened in the teaching said

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:41.120
 that such a great light came light came it kind of eliminated the whole things and king was moved

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:48.480
 so much he feels so lucky and so precious he was so excited he will feel he really liked to see

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:55.200
 these great beings and he asked to the others what is this so this is the first Buddha select

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.720
 line drawns or the images in the buddhist stories second is then again again the second is happened

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.480
 in that time of the again the buddha's abode language buddha was in in the 40s soon after

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:20.800
 buddha left the kingdom in the age 29 kingdom and he become the enlightenment or become the buddha

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:29.200
 at age 35 from that on he began to share this message of loving kind as a comparison non-volence

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.920
 respect and appreciation and and the potential of the all the living beings those messages he began

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:43.280
 to share in that but this father was still alive buddha's father still and he missed so much buddha

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.600
 so much so then finally he sent the messages asked buddha if he can return back to the palace at

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:51.840
 least

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.160
 i would like to see so buddha i agree that he will come back to the compound to the country but he

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.800
 said i will not going to stay in the palace i'm going to stay on the hermitage hermitage outside

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.480

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:20.560

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.210
 ladies are looking to each other's accessories and not really paying the attention to the what budd

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.320
ha

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 is talking to everybody and among that there is another very famous lady lady and the queen of the

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:16.320
 king king of the zangdi she thought all this all young ladies are so excited extracted by their

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:26.320
 own jewelry back and forth fold if i wear my jewelry they won't do this they won't kind of like

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.360
 cheating so it's completely impressed so she said she told that and he asked her attendance

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:42.560
 please go back to my house and get my jewelry my jewelry that attendance young lady was really

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:50.240
 upset she's sending me back such a great teaching how he can do this but then she have to do she

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.800
 have to go so she was left with a little bit kind of sad hard but during on the road she started

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.640
 reflecting the teaching of the buddha buddha and what buddha saying all these things with kind of

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.200
 very joy and appreciate the car and peaceful and then during that on that journey she was

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:21.680
 killed by the cow the cow who gave the baby very what's called the birth of the baby and that

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:30.240
 so she's cow is protecting her baby in a way depends and she honed honed and she died

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.280
 because in the teaching said that she had mind is so peaceful more so calm and peaceful and because

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.880
 of that power and the teaching of the buddhas buddhas immediately she told rebirth in the

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:51.360
 singular shirilanka in now modern time shirilanka as princess king king of bad contours the moment

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.560
 he was born and moment he reflected start communicated she's so kind so gentle so peaceful

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.160
 so loving to everyone really that when she started speaking she liked to see my teacher she started

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:11.360
 talking that and they don't know who is her teacher and all that and then she's the grown up there

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:11.520
 and

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.840
 then that time so many markings are coming from india to shirilanka and going back and they're

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.320
 talking about the buddhas they know the buddha all these things so gradually she she got connected

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.320
 with the merchant and martians told about the buddha and that's what he said that's my teacher

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.760
 i like to see that and how i can get something kind of connection from that and something connected

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:43.200
 to the buddha so because of this martians the records set and as well as heavy powers and

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:53.120
 the second line drawing of the buddhas image was the buddha again he did this allow to do and send

00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:01.280
 send line drawing of the buddhas art and as well as some teachings written and sent back to here

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.080
 and that moment moment he received that she got the greater realization she got the greater

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.480
 realization and that's the second time in the buddhist art and then gradually and then buddha

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:20.240
 statues sonapri and many times buddha that according buddhist tradition many monks and nuns

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:28.400
 go to the to the dana or the sanga or many family many those devoted family offer the lunch they

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.320
 eat only one term lunch in the day only one day male so monks and nuns and they offer also lunch

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:44.000
 that so many times traditionally so then many times those monks and nuns comes to the to the lunch

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.520
 and the buddha not always coming with them are coming them so many of those patterns have missed

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:57.440
 the buddha having that and they ask please can we make a stage of you you and put with that on the

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:05.040
 this hall wherever we give the offering the uh dana dana offerings the way we can put the thing

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.360
 that you so buddha said yes so then they met the stage of the buddha that is that's the kind of

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.040
 third trials then they had the station of the buddhas that and then gradually and his teaching

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.240
 said even during his lifetime and then there is ministrages built by the king indara the god of the

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.280
 king of the god very famous he built so many stages and those are gradually then came to the earth

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:31.680
 and

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:38.640
 when and buddha himself blessed and went to the different places and finally also the two of them

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:47.440
 came to Tibet is in the time of the seventh century seventh century so very famous king of

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:55.200
 turbid first dharma king and the turbid pondering father father of the art and the literature and

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:04.960
 and and the cultural his name was he married three princes one from china one from nepal

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.840
 both the prince bought two statue of the that buddha blessed which is the central kind of

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.800
 playground with sport in ita bed from that time until now called the chorum bhutas so those are

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:26.320
 the some history of the how buddha buddha stages began to come and as well as then art of the

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:34.800
 those uh writing things uh his message the teaching so my barely talk about the art and this in the

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.280
 in this uh in the church church all those many things are really connected with that

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:48.960
 represent of those those art and so that's my really talk about the art and we have some

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:57.840
 questions i'm very happy to discuss

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.000
 yeah i had a question about the uh the large crystal perma in there what's the story with that

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.320
 where did that come from and how did that come about crystal yeah this is uh we had we again

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.640
 who was really blessed our perma sama buddha center our church is blessed by one of the very

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:31.920
 courageous generosity dharma pattern and he passed away his name was bel himin and he went many

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.640
 different places and he collected many different beautiful uh artists every different places so

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:47.120
 this is the one of the his collations it is really crystal it is uh come from i think from nepal i

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:53.440
 think right maybe i think so i don't know exactly where but this is one of the very famous

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.600
 ritual uh symbol of ritual ritual ritual symbol is called purpa or the kalai in sanskrit it is a

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.720
 symbolizing that will calm down that ego cling is in the buddhism ego killing is one of the

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:17.040
 principal obstacles to to pour the peace and harmony and joy and this crystal dragar that

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:24.560
 is called the kalai is a symbol to calm down to pacify the power of the ego clinging

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.120
 self-important and self-centered mind that's what it is symbolized by that

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:45.600
 yes most cultures paintings are in frames and they're solid on a wall and you can't bend them

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:56.480
 but the Tibetan tankas you can roll up like how do the Tibetans can see you know the you know make

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.800
 tankas that you can roll up rather than framing things on the on a wall that you can't move

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:12.880
 this is generally Tibetan the ancient time ancient time uh kind of Tibet is really started with the

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.960
 mall with the nomadic nomadic and also those big monasteries

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:28.640
 big monasteries are started with the camping they call the camp camp so

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:36.960
 camp so therefore camp means that is not really staying in one place moving moving to place to

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:44.080
 places so therefore it's kind of like uh in the in the framed framed is difficult to carry that

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:51.840
 so if you score it then is easy to carry so that's the how i think really started started and then

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.840
 later it become the tradition tradition it become very even they're certain even they have the how

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:05.280
 even they have the big monasteries and beautiful places then even still they start doing that and

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:12.640
 they just become as part of the traditions and most of the time those has three kind of

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:19.760
 frames that all of course most times broke head and three and Buddhism and kind of three is very

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.160
 important Buddha Dharma Sangha and then also symbolize the different kind of levels of the

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.960
 outer inner in a cigarette so those kind of the symbolizations of the there's three frames and

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.760
 then to cite the ribbons those are they're known as like kind of like in the ancient time those

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.880
 bullets uh you see some kind of like air ribbons they're putting in the tester so when they wear

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:54.960
 the crowns there is like hanging hanging kind of uh sugs kind of ornamented so that symbolize

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:04.800
 those two two ribbons ribbons and then this this front the kind of cover with again

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.400
 red and yellow fabrics completely and that is the you see it is kind of like

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:27.440
 clawed for the tanga it is like this is wrong symbolize but that's what it started yes is there

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:34.240
 significance with yellow and red and it's about in a culture all around yeah red and yellow culture

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:44.480
 is a very popular color in the Buddhism of at least the Tibetan Buddhism and the Buddha gave

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:57.600
 monks and nuns two three colors and three color those are known as yellow red and blue colors

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:06.080
 three colors so in the Tibetan Buddhism adopted more red colors and then yellow too more red

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.640
 and then in Sri Lanka and Burma or Thailand they accepted more adopted the yellow colors kind of

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:20.240
 or that and then I think in the China and then Japan maybe they adopted more blue color but then

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.800
 later that become more gray gray color so that's the how I think it really happened so it is very

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.720
 kind of Buddha say like what the Buddha allowed to and three colors and this white and yellow and

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:44.560
 red also ancient time during the Buddha's time these colors are not kind of very highly honored

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:53.680
 color they are very kind of like color of the farmers or the beggars or even sometimes they

00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:00.720
 said color of the wind they rub the body cremation time they use the color of the red

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.360
 and yellow the yellow and the blue things the high honor colors are white at that time so

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:15.840
 therefore the Buddha allowed to use this three color which is color of the not really respected

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:22.320
 eyeliner color at that time more in touch with reality yeah that's true more kind of humble more

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:28.240
 humility and the monks and nuns say they're kind of like still very subcontinent self-continent

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.680
 yet to be kind of like to kind of avoiding all that so many ecstasy things that kind of traits

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:43.440
 trying to stay more simple more humble more quiet but more joy and more respect and more love and

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.440
 kind with mindfulness and that's really the message of the teaching so for to kind of

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.320
 alloy to that call it this and then Buddha give those three colors

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:04.640
 yes yes thank you very much I was wondering in your teaching about the first two Buddhist

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.680
 objects of art about the representations of the Buddha's body would you speak a little bit more

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.840
 about the Buddha's body like maybe a little bit about his major and minor marks what it would

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:20.720
 be like to actually see the Buddha in person and maybe some of the meaning yeah Buddha has

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:28.800
 Buddha's body always the Buddha's body has a beautiful color this and the speech has a

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:36.400
 beautiful color this mind had beautiful extra only color this why because according to Buddha's

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:45.600
 teaching teaching as many of you know that life is not just for example us it's not just the first

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:55.520
 term on this earth nor it is not the last we go throughout the chain of lives lives similarly

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:04.140
 Buddha went through himself went through the chain of lives one after another during those lif

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.400
etimes

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:12.080
 before become the Buddha all those pretty was a lifetimes he did so many good activities best up

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:18.080
 on loving kind and the computations and the compassion and wisdoms all those activities are

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:28.400
 known as generosity activities morality activities patience and the joyful effort mindfulness and

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:36.880
 versatile activities because did these activities to benefit all the beings therefore he got so

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.440
 much

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:46.080
 kind of a realization that realization and result from that so much that reflected to his physical

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:52.880
 that reflected those result that power energy reflected to his voice and to reflect that to

00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:00.320
 the mind so when he's reflected his body in the buddhist that we called thirty two major marks

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:09.520
 and eighty minor marks that symbolizing the Buddha is something special and beautiful

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:17.360
 and the thirty two major marks what are the one of the major marks such as buddhist in the teaching

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:24.720
 state and the Buddhism we believe Buddha's color is the golden column and that is one of the golden

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.680
 completely beautiful golden color and Buddha is always also one of those is also very youthful

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:42.240
 Buddha stayed as 81 light 81 years but yet he has never become old or the kind wrinkles

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:54.400
 so always the skins are so youthful and tight and not lose loss lose no lose lose is tight and

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:03.680
 youthful those are known as also one of the or some of the thirty two major marks and then

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:11.920
 Buddha has also won some of the eighty thirty two major marks and the buddhist is has always aura

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.280
 the visible aura you can see it's glowing aura see that that and then Buddha has also this

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:26.960
 top knot top knot you see now kind of extra hair on this this is not just a muscle or this is not

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.360
 like bone something that kind of like what's called banged his head somewhere and then

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:42.800
 it's not according to Buddhism and the buddhist this is a light aura going up the current chakra

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.930
 aura is going up but then artists they have to do something so it become like like that but

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:48.320
 otherwise

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:57.360
 it really is aura the light is going up so this those are the some the major marks of the physicals

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.080
 and major marks of the speech's voice are Buddha's voice is always soothing

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:14.960
 calming uplifting and the Buddha's voice is also timely spoken exactly as needed not too much up

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:22.240
 not too much down exactly as neat exactly sweet with that individuals and Buddha's toe is has also

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.760
 no distance where you whether you are in a close or whether you're part distance voice reach the

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:37.440
 exactly same level to not shop to not so so low just know those are and then Buddha's voice of

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:37.840
 course

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:47.120
 is always true and honest and respect appreciator as I said as I said uplifting uplifting

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.000
 encouragement

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:56.560
 to wake up your own potentials your own nature your own beauty so it's really uplifting lifting

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.960
 and Buddha's voice is also equal that to everyone nature is the same is not just kind of like

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:10.720
 it is not kind of like uh owned by the some selected groups nature is equal to every living

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:18.800
 beings so those are known as the some qualities of the voice major marks and then mind's major

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:27.120
 mind is loving kindness compassion wisdom kindness has no difference between at all to every living

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.880
 beings whether you Buddha know whether you know Buddha or whether you don't know Buddha this love

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:40.160
 and compassion and is equal to everyone as the sunlight shine in the sky so that has no distinct

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:46.640
 at all wherever the opportunity wherever that circumstance day there is sunlight comes and the

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.120
 same way that's what teaching says so those are really the quality of the Buddha's the major marks

00:36:53.120 --> 00:37:02.960
 then Buddha's also then so major marks Buddha Buddha is never sweating Buddha never sweaters

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:12.000
 then there are sweaters and the Buddha never smells the what's called order all those smells

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.080
 and Buddha's also cloth according to teaching cloth is always not also touching exactly the

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:26.080
 physical kind of is always there is a little space space day so air moves like this this and

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:34.320

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:42.720
 yep really too as I said the Songzi Gumbo the first not first kind the very famous 33rd king

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.800
 of Tibet known as Songzi Gumbo he married I mean he became the one of the also very powerful

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:57.200
 arising power of the Tibetan dynasty and he married two princes one is a prince from China

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:03.760
 or the tank tank dynasty the prince of tank dynasties and then he married with one also

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:11.600
 from Nepal the king of Nepal I'm sure one more cold and two prince these two countries are already

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.040
 buddhist countries that term buddhism is very flourishing in these two countries and buddhism

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:25.760
 came with peace and harmony there is no come buddhism never came with war is with respect

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:32.640
 and appreciation really adopted by all those countries because it tells peace harmony

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.640
 comparison love and kindness it's good to everyone I mean that's what they all thought and then

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.480
 adopted the teaching so so so the already buddhism is very flourishing but it's better is not

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:51.360
 completely buddhist country that time time so this king Songzi Gumbo was very powerful king

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:58.080
 and he was as I said before he was he is really the founder of the Tibetan art and cultural

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:07.680
 literature and architectural and all these beautiful things and so when she said I said

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:15.120
 when the post he married with uh Nepali princess and he bought buddhist statue at year

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:25.520
 at year at year old buddha at year old size of the statues to Tibet which is now we called

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:32.560

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:50.800
 that and which is in the now lasa in a principle of central chapel or central temple called chowom

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:57.120
 bhuchis this both buddhas are the stages are balanced by the buddha chaktaman himself

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:03.600
 according to made buddhist stories and therefore it is so powerful so blissful it is like for the

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:13.200
 Tibetan it is like these two two statues I are like as like jerusalem or al mecha for the buddhist
