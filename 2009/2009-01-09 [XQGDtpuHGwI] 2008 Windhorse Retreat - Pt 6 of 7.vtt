 [BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.600
 [FOREIGN]

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.760
 >> And then we do this again for us, the prayer flags, and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.800
 which are many beautiful teachings of the Buddha in Gurbel Masambhava.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.200
 And many of them are teachings.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.080
 Those are printed in these beautiful colors, beautiful calligraphes.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.680
 And then with symbolic, all the different designs.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.480
 Those are, again, not just designed by anyone, but

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.120
 is according to the teachings of the Buddha in Gurbel Masambhava.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 Other great master's teachings.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.480
 So that is really important.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.880
 And along with that, then we do the other marriage activities,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.600
 to also kind of glorify this particular mandala, the mandala of the Pema Samyali.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.120
 This is one of the very beautiful mandalas,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.200
 that it has many different levels of the meanings.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.120
 And different levels of the teachings, that teachings and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.720
 our body, speech, mind represented by really our authentic quality of the body,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.720
 speech, mind, represented by these mandalas.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.960
 And also in a way, we kind of touch to these qualities, these naturals.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.040
 And that will also strengthen our nature of the mind, and as well as others.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.080
 And so therefore, it is, I can re-glorify these places.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.520
 And in the Buddha's teaching often also said that ancient time,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.120
 they called three month rainy season retreat.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.760
 And during that, during that time, or before that time,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.560
 often in the Buddha's teaching, the Buddha Shakyamuni said,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.760
 you should also kind of like, what's called remodel.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:17.080
 Remodel or renovating, and renovating, and repairs of the place,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 where you're going to do practice and meditate, or the temples, or the ritual cabins.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.160
 Because when you do this, this is also mandatory activities.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.080
 This place is not just only kind of like going to use with the negative emotions.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.320
 But it will reach and pray, this will continually standing as a source of

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 the inspiration, joy and peace, happiness, and a symbol of love and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.120
 compassion, and the wisdom, now and the future.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.600
 So when we are ready kind of also supported to that, it always in the Buddha's

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.920
 teaching say, you're supporting to the big vision, big goal.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.080
 That will kind of like benefit so many beings, so many generations to come,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 and so many beings now.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.760
 And therefore, often said, fix the area, renovate the areas.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.680
 Areas.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.480
 And then in the meditation, often said,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.120
 mandala to kind of like do some different activity with mandala.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.560
 Related with mandala is such, again, not a mandatory activity.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.720
 Because generally, mandala is not just an external object.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.520
 Mandala is something connected with a very personal,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.640
 inner level of our true nature of the mind, and the Buddha nature.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.400
 And our very physical condition, physical systems.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.320
 In a way, when you do that, they reflect back to you or back to others.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.400
 I mean, it really is just a kind of cooperating very beautiful circles of

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.080
 the completely total, total wholeness, wholesome.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.960
 I mean, wholesome situation of the refined in that mandala state.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.840
 So therefore, again, in Vedayana teaching is very, very special.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.960
 So we also do some kind of other mandatory activities along with the raising of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.520
 the prayer place every, as we can do.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.360
 And again, that is, I mean, what we do during this time.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.920
 And then, of course, tomorrow we give the teachings or

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.640
 the empowerment of the medvatsapai and more teachings on that.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.920
 But today we will focus on that.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.720
 And then I think afternoon to some higher pujas and so forth.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 So that is a brief kind of like introduction and

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.520
 a reminding of these mornings, the practices and what we'll do.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.560
 (singing in foreign language)
