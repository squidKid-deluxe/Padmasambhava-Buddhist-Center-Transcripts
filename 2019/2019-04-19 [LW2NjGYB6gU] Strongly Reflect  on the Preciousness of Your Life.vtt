00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.980
 It's so, so precious, so special, so beautiful. It's very difficult to obtain this art. And in the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:16.000
 Buddha teaching, mentioned, and I'm sure you read, I'm not sure you know, you know that in what is.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.430
 So in the teaching said, also think of this precious human body, what we have. Think of the, what

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.980
 Buddha used examples. Examples to get this. And what Buddha used examples.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 In the Buddha, in the teaching said, does the whole, in the ocean, in the big ocean. Ocean, this is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 not just an existing story, but it's called in the Vedic, Dapantara, means something impossible,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.980
 something can happen. And this is something, it's just to use that examples.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.400
 Impossible things can happen in the, in the, in the happens, that examples. It's not something that

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.980
 happens in the past, but it's all in the present and future, but it's just examples.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.560
 So there is total, and total is long lives. I understand total as well as long lives, but this has,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.070
 total, total years, like life span. Again, it's just like an, an, an, possible things happen in the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.980
, in the animal levels there. So this total, and also this total is blind, blind as can see.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:41.040
 Every hundred years, total come up, you know, ocean surfaces. So hundred, every hundred, that is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 again, other, like as, kind of just that. And you know, in the ocean, there is one wood, wood or y

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.980
ork.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:02:00.410
 In the teaching, say the york, york that has, has hole, or big hole, and it's floating in that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.980
 ocean, in that ocean.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 And floating, it goes up and down or wherever the wind comes, and that, it goes that direction.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:17.060
 If wind comes from east, it goes west. Wind comes from south, it goes north. I mean, it's just

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.980
 floating everywhere.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:29.730
 So a hundred years, the ocean comes on the surface, and that hole comes up, and that hole of the y

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.980
ork can catch in the net of the total. Catch.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.970
 That is very impossible something, but it could be happen. So in the one Buddha use the example,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:55.550
 that even, obtain the British human body is more rare than the total catching his neck in the, in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.980
 the, in the, in the york.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.840
 When you come hundred years, comes up, so it's dead. At that time, total don't see, total don't

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.320
 have intention that he like to put his neck into this york, and the york don't have intention that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.980
 I like to try to catch the total's neck.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.990
 And then it becomes as rain, and never have to be told, but can catch. And that is very impossible

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.980
 situation, but to get human, this British human body is even more precious than that.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:42.840
 And then Buddha use the examples as a piece. P-E-A, piece. If you put that on the wall, can it be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.980
 possible to catch on the wall or stay on the wall?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:56.310
 No, it's very difficult. Again it's impossible. But then Buddha said, even, even that, that to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.630
 catch that, you feel on the wall is impossible, but even more, more impossible to obtain a, of this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.980
 human body.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.970
 How the rain, how break this? How break this? And then in the teaching said, again, in the needle,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.690
 in the needle, if you throw this piece on the needle, dry doodle, dry doodle on the, on that needle

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.980
, how many times the needle will caught the piece and catch it?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:42.500
 It's very difficult. Not always easy. It's dry, dry pea. Dry pea. That is even to obtain the human

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.400
 body is more difficult and more precious than the catching the piece on the, or dry piece on the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.980
 top of the needle.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.700
 Those are the really great teacher Buddha use the examples, how to obtain such this break this

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:10.340
 human body. So that's known as, as thinking of the examples of how, how, how difficult to obtain

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.980
 this break this human body.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.980
 Therefore we should have the great joy and appreciation and make benefit with this, what we call.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:30.710
 So that is, and the next one in the teaching said, and take of the numbers of these numbers,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.980
 reflect on the numbers of the beings.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:43.730
 And now we are human beings. And among the six beings, we are the one of those six beings. But

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.980
 according to Buddha teaching, Buddha teaching, other than beings, you know of rams.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:06:18.720
 The hell ram, hunger ghost ram, and animal ram, and then human ram, asura, and, and, and God's ram,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.740
 those six. So now we take number of them. According to Buddha teaching, the number of the hell ram

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.980
 beings are number less, number less.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:29.430
 And what the teaching said. It's like, justice of the earth. Justice of the earth. And the number

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:39.980
 of the hunger ghost rams are like, like sand, sand, sand of the bank of the river Ganges.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:52.790
 Sand of the river of the bank of the, bank of river Ganges. Ganges. And this, the animal ram

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:03.980
 numbers are like, as like, I mean, this is an example of that.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:13.820
 The grain of the, grain of the, in it, they make the chunks, chunks, chunks, you know, like alcohol

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.980
s, they make it alcohol.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:23.730
 And the way alcohols, we did, what, what, barley, barley. Barley, barley, barley, barley chunk,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:32.980
 chunk, or barley, and after they take out the, the, the, the, the play word, or the alcohol out,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.980
 then that become unrelated through that.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:43.730
 So this is so many, so many of those people who made it. So this, the, the animal rams, like that,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.980
 it's just so many, heaped up as a, like, bomber.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:58.910
 Bomber, that barley grain, that are used things, so many numbers. To compare of those three low r

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:08.210
ams, the upper rams, gods, human astral rams, is just like rasta on the, on the nail, rasta on the

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.980
 nail.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:17.250
 That's really how, see, so therefore, even human population is so much, now they talk so much, but

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.600
 to compare with that, they call it Buddhism, it's not, I mean, to compare with others, it's not

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.980
 much.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:30.810
 Then you should think of the comparing with human race, but how many people have that, the ten

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:37.980
 lectures? Or how many people have the 18 endowments? How many people?

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:51.350
 If there is, like, billions, maybe, like, like, maybe, they just say, like, two percent, or three

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:58.980
 percent, four percent has eaten, eaten endowments, all at freedoms.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:08.370
 Among that, think of how many people have eaten endowments, it's getting less and smaller and

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.980
 smaller, smaller and smaller.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.150
 So to think of that way, for us, truly we are very important, that's what we call ourselves, once

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.980
 and while, truly we are important, we are blessed.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:32.150
 Blessed. We have all different motivations. We're trying to keep our body, speech, mind intact

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.980
 within the state of kindness and compassion, respect and appreciation.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.980
 And with mindfulness and all that, it's really so special, so grateful.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:52.730
 Now thinking of this, this endowmentism, it's not just merely kind of intellectual thoughts. If you

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.980
 think this is mindfulness, it is mindfulness.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:06.440
 If each of you think of that, bring more joy and abiding on that state, it's mindfulness, abiding

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.980
 on the previous human qualities.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:18.950
 Each of those, you will not ignore it. We highlight of the goodness of ourself and experience and

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.980
 stay in that status.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:28.980
 It's truly mindfulness. It's mindfulness. That's what's called body, mindfulness of the body.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.980
 It's mindfulness of the body and entire thoughts.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:42.980
 So those ideas I've taught two things, don't you?
