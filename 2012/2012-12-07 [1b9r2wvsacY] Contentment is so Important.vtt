00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860
 This is the holy land in India where the Buddha spent so many years, over 20 years, after his

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.000
 enlightenment.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 There are very rich devotees, and his Dharma patterns are known as another punakas.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 One day another punaka invited him. Many times he invited the whole Sangha congregation for lunch.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 Many times he invited, and each time we invited, each time when the Buddha's teaching said, "You

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000
 should dedicate that merit."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 So every time they dedicated the merits, merit to whatever, they do military activities.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 And now another punaka again, he invited one day Buddha, and this time another punaka asked,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.770
 "Buddha, Buddha, please could you dedicate this merit of my offering lunch to you all, or the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 poorest person in our country?"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Poorest person. So they get married with this. Then Buddha said, "Yes."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.790
 So then end that lunch is finished, and according each time and out to you in the Southern Buddhist

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.000
 school they do.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 After finishing the lunch, those are the patrons who offered the lunch and who met that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.460
 Come in the middle of the room and sit on the floor and then listen the dedication prayers, merit

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.390
 So another punaka and his family member came right in front of the Buddha and sit on the floor and

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.000
 listened Buddha's dedication prayers.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And Buddha dedicated to who?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.700
 Buddha said, "Whatever the merit that God from this, this lunch offering provided in another padak

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.000
as,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 made that merit all goes to the king of their country."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 To the king is called personjita, sahaja.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.790
 So then all that finished, and everything the dedication finished, and then another punaka came up

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.000
 to Buddha very politely.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 "Buddha, I ask you to dedicate the merit, the poorest person in our country,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 and you can dedicate the merit to the most richest and powerful person in the country."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Buddha said, "Yes, I dedicate the merit to king of personjita."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.700
 Why? He is the poorest person in our country, even though he has everything, still he is not enough

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.000
.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 He is always crying, always crying, "Therefore, I dedicate this merit to him."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So that tells the wealth externally. Wealth is not really rich. Heart has to be rich.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 If your heart becomes rich, and your external wealth is rich, then it is excellent.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.990
 But if external wealth, you have so much, and in the heart is always crying and hungry and thirsty

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.000
 all the time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 It is poor. You have no rest. That person has no peace mind.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Therefore, meditation, when you do the cause of meditation, content is so important.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 It will become one of the best support for the practice of meditation.
