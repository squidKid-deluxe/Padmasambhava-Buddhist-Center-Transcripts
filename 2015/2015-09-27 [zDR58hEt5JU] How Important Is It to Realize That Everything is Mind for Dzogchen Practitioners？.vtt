00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 Thank you, Rinpoche. I have two questions. The first one is, in order for our Dzogchen meditation

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.000
 to keep progressing, how important is it for us to realize that everything is mind?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.460
 Not just to think this is mind, this is mind, but to really have more and more conviction that

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.000
 everything we experience is just mind. How important is that?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.300
 Dzogchen practitioners are definitely important to know everything is mind. Generally in Buddhism,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.040
 Mahayana, all Mahayana and Vedayana really understand that everything is mind is very important

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.000
 because it is true, everything is mind.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 And for that reason, for example, Dzogchen teaching, always in the teaching, said, as we went,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.380
 really those where mind is coming, where is mind now, where is it when, and those are we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.000
 establishing of this mind's emptiness.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 And now, that is mind. But now, we think of all our perceptions. Everything is mind. All

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.000
 perceptions, conceptions, is our mind.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 And then, the cause of perception, cause of conception, also is mind, according to Buddhism,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 everything is mind. Mind develops all these things.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.770
 So, whatever that is, song, smell, taste, touch, all that is mind develops. Mind develops. So, that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 is according to Buddhism and mind only school.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.550
 That is again one of the very few Buddhist schools. And in that school, the Buddha teaching,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.000
 entirely these three realms are mind.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.970
 Entirely three realms is mind. How you will know that is mind. And in Buddhism, always use one of

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.000
 the leading examples as a dream.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.730
 Dream, all what we dream in the dream. We have form, we have object, we have sound, we have all

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 these things. What is this?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.370
 And where we are dreaming, we see differently. We see subject and object, all that things. But

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 reality level is mind.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.560
 There is no independent existing of those forms and images and sound of the dream outside. It is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.000
 all mind.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.370
 Similarly, according to the Buddha teaching of mind only school, from that mind only school, all

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.000
 the Vedayana, this is our big dreams.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.790
 What we are. It is all dreams. It is dream images. When we develop these dream images, again in the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000
 teachings said, from the biggest times.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 There is no numbers, even that times. We develop three habit patterns at the very beginning time.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.790
 Habit patterns of the universe, habit patterns of our physical and habit patterns of our awareness

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.000
 or consciousness.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And it is activated. That is what we are really reflecting.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So therefore, deep down everything is mind. And then in the perception, consultancy level is mind.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 And when we see, for example, who sees? Who sees, I see that. It is your mind.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.980
 Your mind, intelligence is reflected through the eye organ and sense to the palm and that kind of

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.000
 picture came in and then you say, I see that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And then same with all the other senses. So the perception is mind. Consultant is mind. Mind.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.200
 So therefore, it is truly it is. And therefore, Manet teaching, in the Dokki teachings, again in

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 the mind session teaching, Buddha instruction teaching,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.790
 always say that but also in the philosophical second teaching to bring up exactly the nature of the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.000
 mind as emptiness.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.220
 It is very important to have this certainty wisdom. This is certainty wisdom to bring up this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.000
 realization.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 We are not making force, understanding, covering up something. It is true. It is exactly.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.710
 And the kind of brain truth as truth is realizations. And that is mind, everything mind is really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.000
 very important.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.240
 It is true. And then mind itself is empty. Mind. Even though mind is everything, but mind itself is

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.000
 empty.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.390
 And that's what we get all those parts of the person in the future kind of embers get it. We don't

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.000
 see mind. It's empty like that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.330
 And therefore, Buddha is teaching in general, mind is empty. Therefore, it is a correction. Mind

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.000
 propagates everything.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Therefore, it is emptiness. It's also emptiness. Therefore, therefore, then what Buddha teaching.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.450
 Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. And form is not emptiness. Emptiness is not form. That is the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.000
 real truth, exactly as it is.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.330
 It's not just making up things, that. So brain that realization is so important in a Jockey

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.000
 teaching.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.010
 So that you have the kind of like, you anchor to yourself. You have the realization of something,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.000
 something, something.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.710
 So then now, what your thought comes. For example, that is in a two practice, kareer masi, mati lab

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.000
ne.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And of course, Jockey is the same thing. Everything is our perceptions.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Why we don't? Why when nurses come scared with that? Or when they can analyze that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.070
 And that is again, for example, great master Manarepa. When he is meditating, when he sees all

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.000
 those vegans.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 What I will say last week, and what we say. He said, great my teacher, problem matva.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Matva introduced me. Everything is mind. Every perception is mind.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.490
 And he introduced me. So my mind is empty. With that realization, then he can be bored of that

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.000
 realization.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 As he already practice meditating that, and he bored of that realization.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 They know the perceptions of the disciplines are dissolved.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 So therefore, a Jockey teaching, realization of everything is mind is very important.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 It is very important to understand of the Jockey.
