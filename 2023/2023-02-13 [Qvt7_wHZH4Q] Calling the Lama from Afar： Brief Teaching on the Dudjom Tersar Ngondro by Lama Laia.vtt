00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 Offer the mandala, so if you have the daily prayers, page 24.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 The earth anointed with perfumed water and strewn with flowers, Mount Meru and the four continents,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.280
 ornamented with sun and moon. By offering them visualized as a Buddha field,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:34.760
 may all sentient beings enjoy the pure land, idam guru ratna mandala kam niyata yami.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.040
 According to the wishes of sentient beings and their capacities for the high and low,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.200
 common and uncommon vehicles, please turn the wheel of Dharma.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:10.800
 We make that request humbly and joyfully to our precious gurus, the precious lamas of

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:22.760
 the lineage, and like we always begin with the lama, unrepayable kindness, only remember

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:33.880
 the lama, unrepayable kindness, only remember the lama, unrepayable kindness, only remember

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:48.440
 the lama. And so with that great joy, that great appreciation,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.760
 big, big bodhicitta, not just that we're being of benefit, but by receiving the teachings

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:04.240
 and applying them to our own minds and hearts, all beings can know true peace, remove the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.480
 darkness of their ignorance and be liberated in their natural state of peace and joy without

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.240
 grasping and with that great confidence and joy and devotion to that just innate purity

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.360
 of our total experience and especially of that of our teachers, you know, who just begin

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 our practice, maintain our practice, conclude our practice.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.600
 And last week I think Lama Drampa really beautifully was addressing some questions that came and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.040
 in particular looking at this questions that came up around this beautiful prayer we say

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.440
 and recite during our weekly sessions as well as many of us in our daily practices, this

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:15.640
 prayer called calling the lama from afar, which is in the the nundro book, page 18.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 And I think the person writing had a few questions and I think Lama Drampa just like I said very

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.920
 beautifully, very kindly, but lots of encouragement kind of address some of the questions around

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 just when we're presented with this big view and realization, you know, kind of kind of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.800
 not feeling discouraged, but how to, you know, connecting with being encouraged.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.640
 And I also just thought that some of these other questions, they're good questions and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.600
 they were questions that came.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.960
 And so I definitely wanted to just bring them up because they seem very worthy.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.240
 So I just have to call them up, I'm going to sing them a jig here.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 But I'll read them and then we can continue.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:40.600
 Okay, sorry.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.720
 So I'll just read these questions, or, you know, thoughts, and then just give a little

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720
 reply.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.720
 Again, it's only my reply, but here we are.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.000
 Definitely all of these are things for us to contemplate ourselves, you know, I'm reflecting,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.960
 we all have heard so many teachings and practices, so reflecting.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.760
 So the prayer of calling the Lama from afar, and then the person is saying first asking,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.040
 I think the basics of it is to know and experience the Lama is within us.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.960
 Is that true?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.520
 And there's so many words that are esoteric to me, such as then the second question, which

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:32.320
 she's asking about what is this youthful vase body that's mentioned in the prayer.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.080
 And then again, another third question, the prayer begins with requests to the Buddha's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.880
 Lamas of the Three Caias.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.400
 How do these three enlightened beings correlate to the Three Caias?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.120
 In other words, who are these three Buddhas, Yeshe Dorje, Dachen Dorje, and Drodo Lingpa?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.120
 Why are they representing the Three Caias?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.320
 Good question.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.600
 And then the rest was the questions I think Lama Dropa kind of addressed kind of those

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:14.040
 points yesterday.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:22.240
 So question one with the Lama within us, is this true?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.520
 Yes, definitely.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.880
 Like Rinpoche say, and of course, I can talk a little now, but in Rinpoche's book, Illuminating

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:37.680
 the Path, this commentary on the Dojum Terso Nundra, there is one of the first chapters,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.120
 a very brief and very beautiful kind of teaching on calling the Lama from afar.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.680
 So there's more in-depth answers to these questions right there, right here in this

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.600
 book.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.620
 And like Rinpoche say in that, this prayer calling the Lama from afar, it's like looking

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.680
 into a mirror in that sense, or like I was thinking, Kenshin Pauldin, Shera Rinpoche,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.800
 he often just delighted in the meanings of words.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.060
 And he always, I can remember a few times when talking about the Guru and Guru Yoga,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:28.460
 he always like with a glint in his eye and laughing with spell it, "Gee, you are you."

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.000
 And that just really delighted him.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.220
 So there's a little teaching reflecting there.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:39.680
 But I think the important thing with all of our practice we have to remember basis is

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:48.320
 really reflecting at least recalling and hopelessly establishing more and more in our mind streams,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:55.840
 in our familiarity, these four seals of all the Buddha's teachings and practices.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.360
 Yes, the Buddha is within.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.440
 The Lama is within.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:18.760
 However, there's no intrinsically, substantially, permanently existing anything is a really

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.840
 fundamental view right in the Buddha's teachings.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:36.920
 That all phenomena is illusory, all phenomena is impermanent.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:47.760
 That samsara, ignorance, attachment, ego clinging is what equals samsara.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.340
 And therefore, there may be temporary comforts in samsara, but by definition, because we

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:05.200
 have our basic ignorance of how things truly are, samsara is suffering in vast ways.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:13.960
 But the deepest way is that down deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep anxiety

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:20.380
 due to just the great illusion that we exist, right?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.960
 So samsara is suffering.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.320
 And then the fourth seal, when we see things as they are, when we're familiar with things

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:38.440
 how they are, which is beyond coming, going, birth, death, happiness, sorrow, beyond all

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:47.040
 that, the indestructible nature, the non-dual, absolute nature of our mind, of bodhicitta,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.920
 is peace.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.620
 Nirvana is peace.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.160
 And it's those great beings such as Kenchen, Palden, Cherub, Rinpoche, Kimpose, Gondondo,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.640
 Rinpoche, His Holiness, Dudrim, Rinpoche, Dingo, Kensei, Rinpoche, all these great masters

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:14.400
 growing up, Vimala Mitra, Padmasambhava, Buddha Shakyamuni, Yashai Sojal, Mandarava, all these

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.720
 great beings have realized, they've done the work, they have realized, brought to fruition,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.920
 that realization of the true nature as it is.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.360
 And that is the lama.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:35.040
 Like if we remember the word meaning of lama, is the Tibetan word lama, Sanskrit word guru,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:44.480
 la is like high, ma is like, in one way is like nothing or negation, nothing higher.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:56.850
 But then also Rinpoche mentioned too, ma also engenders being motherly, being caring, compassionate

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:56.880
.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:07.080
 So the supreme, caring one, the supreme, highest realization of bodhicitta and realization,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.080
 and the outer level is the lama, fully realized that's our outer lama, who through that great

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.040
 kindness and our good connection, we shows us that like we say, the nature of our own

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:29.640
 mind, the Dharmakaya of our own mind, and ways to become more and more familiar with that.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:39.240
 That's the outer lama, who's showing us our inner lama for sure.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:12:04.940
 And then the second question, I guess too, I'll just take a step back in that same vein

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:17.880
 too, this just calling the lama from afar, remembering too, for we ordinary beings with

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:24.320
 our conceptions and way of framing things, we're working with that dream, the Buddha's

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:39.840
 blessings are not far. They're timeless, both timeless and also very timely and skillful,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:48.920
 blazing realization and compassion of our precious teachers. It's not far at all. It's

00:12:48.920 --> 00:13:00.880
 all pervading, three caiyas, all pervading. And as Kimpo Sei Wong, Dondyo Rinpoche has

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.800
 pointed out, calling the lama from afar isn't so much like calling the teacher from some

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:17.600
 remote place, come here, come here, you know, it's more so calling the lama from afar is

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:28.160
 kind of waking up to that all pervading, blazing compassion and wisdom that's with us. Kindling,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:35.240
 bringing up our devotion, our bodhicitta, kind of, it's not the lama who's far, it's

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:45.360
 maybe more me who's zoned out. And so waking up, calling, rejoicing, reflecting on the

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.720
 teachings, that's where all these so many beautiful, spontaneous prayers and composed

00:13:51.720 --> 00:14:01.460
 prayers of calling the lama from afar are, these prayers of devotion. Again, devotion

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:08.640
 and blessings go, in a way, they're one and the same. They go both ways. It's like there's

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.720
 a story of the great teacher whose student asks, "O Lama, Lama, give me blessings."

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:22.620
 And the lama said, "Student, student, give me devotion." And I think a really important

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:31.880
 thing to remember in that statement is that wasn't the lama being arrogant and contractual.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:39.440
 He was pointing out the nature of devotion and blessings. Like the teachings say, devotion

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:48.160
 opens our minds and hearts to receive the blessings that are inherently all-pervading.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.560
 And if we kind of can be that courageous to open ourselves and bring out our bodhicitta,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:02.360
 how beautiful. So that was just a little reflection on that first part. Yes, it's showing us our

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:12.280
 own dharmakaya nature, our own sambhogakaya nature, our own namanakaya nature, calling

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:20.480
 the blessings of the fully enlightened teacher who shows us that. And reflecting and relaxing

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:30.440
 with that meaning, again bringing, removing the veils of obscuration to bring out the

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:39.200
 Buddha nature, all of our practice, removing obscurations, bringing out our innate wisdom.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:48.680
 So youthful base body was the second one. So youthful base body, many of us have heard

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:56.040
 the term, it comes up a lot, especially in the Dzogchen teachings. And the youthful base

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.920
 body is referring here, in this specific prayer, it's referring to the dharmakaya nature of

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:10.600
 our own mind, right? The essence, primordally unchanging, the innate nature free of all

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:18.960
 elaboration, dwells as the youthful base body, the originally pure profound clarity. So the

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:28.040
 youthful base body is also another word for our Buddha nature. So it's referring here

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:38.760
 to our dharmakaya nature, but our Buddha nature, the nature of our mind, open, vast, uncontrived,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:54.940
 one yet full of clarity and brilliance. And that's called youthful. And here we're talking

00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:04.440
 about the youth, youthfulness that's beyond coming or going, that's beyond aging, that's

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:15.040
 beyond birth, beyond death, that kind of great youthfulness, immortal, deathless state. And

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.400
 then the vase, the body and the vase, like that Buddha nature, this is kind of a metaphor

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:29.800
 for our Buddha nature. The youthful base body in one way is like, there's a vase, you know,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:40.080
 closed bumpa. And inside the bumpa is this youthful body, Buddha nature. But it's just

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.240
 due to our obscurations, we don't see it. Or like Rinpoche said, like if there was a candle

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:54.400
 or a light inside a clay vase that was sealed, we don't see that light. And then another

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:01.680
 part of the metaphor is also, if there's a vase, the space inside the vase is equal to

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:09.880
 the space outside the vase. And that shell is kind of just like maybe like our our misunderstanding

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:19.360
 or our obscurations. So as we practice, as we learn, as we contemplate, as we meditate,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.040
 we kind of reduce our obscurations and create little cracks, and maybe the lights shining

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:34.480
 out a little more, the great space is equalizing more. The youthful Buddha nature is revealed,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:47.400
 but it was always there, just not seen, right. And then I think her next questions were around

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:55.960
 the three Kaya aspect here. So I'll just say a little bit about that too. I just made a

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:06.960
 couple of notes so I didn't totally lose my train of thought. So yeah, the Dharma Kaya

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:19.480
 Lama, Dharma Kaya Lama, Yeshe Dorje, be aware of me. Please grant blessings to attain great

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:31.400
 confidence in the view. Here Yeshe, Yeshe Dorje, this first part is of course this referred

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:40.360
 to as Dharma Kaya Awareness and the Dharma Kaya Lama. And again, this, the three Kayas,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.920
 the Dharma Kaya, Sambhogakaya, Normanakaya, they're not three separate things. They're

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:57.480
 three aspects of the nature. The Dharma Kaya is like that, like it says here, the unchanging

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:09.200
 uncontrived openness. Sambhogakaya is the spontaneously arising clarity. Normanakaya is through

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.520
 that

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:25.400
 union of emptiness and compassion emanating to benefit beings according to their needs.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.440
 They're not three different places. And likewise, these three Lamas aren't three different Lamas.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:38.040
 They're three, again, reflecting on different aspects of the realization of the great outer

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:47.640
 Lamas, as well as our three Kaya nature, the openness, the uncontrived, innate nature, free

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:57.400
 of elaboration of our Dharma Kaya mind, that naturally unceasing, luminous clarity, just

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:04.840
 ceaselessly, spontaneously, blissfully, luxuriously, always arising inseparable from that Dharma

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:18.560
 Kaya. And then this Normanakaya, the compassion appearing to beings as needed without any

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:30.960
 bias equally for everyone according to needs and totally free of any limitation. Those

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:39.040
 are the three Kayas, right? Then the three Kaya Lama, the three qualities of the three

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.680
 Buddha realizations are the three qualities of the nature. So Yeshe Dorje is here in this

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:55.880
 part referring to Yeshe, the primordial wisdom, Dorje is the Vadra, indestructible awareness

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.160
 of primordial wisdom, the primordial wisdom that's indestructible. Again, the youthful

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:12.280
 vase body beyond birth, death. That vastness is Yeshe Dorje, Dharma Kaya Lama. Be aware

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:22.960
 of me, but also may I be aware of you. May I be aware of you, Dharma Kaya Lama. May I

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:31.000
 be aware of my own Dharma Kaya nature as well as aware of our great teachers, right? And

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.320
 then all of these three names are also different names. It's a way of connecting with Duryamrapashe

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.320
,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:48.070
 His Holiness Duryamrapashe, Jiggyal Yeshe Dorje. So Yeshe Dorje is one of His Holiness Duryamrapas

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.280
he's

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:57.160
 names, as far as outer Lama goes. And this name arose from the time when Duryamrapashe

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:06.360
 was conceived. Right around the time Duryamrapashe was conceived, his father had a dream. And

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:13.240
 in the dream, a Dakini appeared to him and gave him two things. He gave him a melon,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:23.080
 a mirror, beautiful clear mirror, and a Vajra, a Dorje, and said, "This is his name." And

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:30.640
 then the father knew that that meant his name was Yeshe Dorje. The mirror was like that

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:39.680
 profound, limitless, uncontrived, open clarity of the Dharma Kaya and the Vajra, the indestructible

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:47.920
 awareness. So that's one way of connecting. So this is the deep, deep meaning that transcends

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.080
 any one person of our Dharma Kaya nature is this indestructible wisdom, primordial wisdom,

00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:04.320
 great openness, the great Prajna Paramita. And then also, specifically, our great teacher

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:12.820
 Duryamrapashe was given this name by his father from this dream he had when the Dakini gave

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:24.260
 the mirror and the Dorje to him. And then let's see, some Bhoga Kaya Lama. "The nature

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:32.040
 unceasing conjoined configuration of luminous clarity dwells as the display of the spontaneously

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:38.920
 present five certainties." Ooh, there's a lot in that line, isn't there? But let's

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.440
 just keep it simple and just say everything arising, all that clarity, vivid, you know,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.920
 again the Dharma Kaya isn't an empty blank state, our own mind, right? We look to our

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:59.440
 mind, we can't find it, and yet it's full of awareness, full of clarity, you know, everything.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:07.520
 And then the deep, deep teachings, everything is that Sombhoga Kaya arising clarity that's

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:16.760
 equally empty in nature. Spontaneous, free Sombhoga Kaya is like the body of luxuries,

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:22.400
 it's luxurious, it's rich, it's the body of bliss, you know, again not bliss we cling

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:36.560
 to, but just the natural expressive energy of the nature. Dei-Chen Dorje, Dei-Chen Dorje,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:44.320
 the indestructible great bliss is what Dei-Chen Dorje means. Dei-Chen is like Dei-Waa-Chenpo,

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:55.200
 Dei-Chen great blissfulness that's indestructible. Is that Sombhoga Kaya nature, the luxurious

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:04.560
 body, a rising energy of the nature? And again we're praying, please be aware of me, and

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.440
 may I be aware of that, may we all be aware of that, may we all have our Sombhoga Kaya

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:23.520
 realization. And you know, really get to know our meditation and see things clearly as they

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:38.760
 are. And then also again, this was another name of Joja Mirampashe, and I think the full

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:58.440
 name was Je-Drung. No, the full name was Jig-Dral, sorry, Jig-Dral Kunzong Tin-lei Dei-Chen Dorje.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:06.920
 And this name came, was bestowed upon Joja Mirampashe by, there was a great turton whose

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:20.320
 name was Je-Drung-Sampad-Jung-Nay. And after the previous emanation of Du-Jum was Du-Jum-Ling-Pa,

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:28.000
 really great, great turton who was right before his own as Du-Jum Mirzhe's life. And so many

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.080
 of his students were unaware that he had been reincarnated or a tuku of Du-Jum-Ling-Pa had

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:44.920
 appeared, which is in, what's in Pemako. And there's a beautiful place on the mural here

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:51.600
 at Padmasami-ling showing when his students finally met him. But this great turton Je-Drung-Sampad-

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.720
Jung-Nay,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:28:03.380
 he was aware of the tuku of Du-Jum-Ling-Pa. And it was he who, when he sent the students

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.920
 to go meet the tuku, he had a long life prayer and in that long life prayer, that's where

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:19.600
 he named this name. De-Chun Dorje arises from that in one way. So again, we're also remembering

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:31.400
 the life of this great teacher and great student and great example of the Dharma in Du-Jum-Ling-Pa.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:42.240
 The Nermanakaya Lama, Dro-Du-Ling-Pa, be aware of me. So that again, that great compassion

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:57.160
 from that unity of emptiness and appearances of vastness and clarity, openness is the Nermanakaya,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:10.240
 it's the all-pervading compassion that appears to beings according to needs. It's the Nermanakaya,

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:18.040
 so Nermanakaya, the compassion without bias, the primordial wisdom free of all limitations,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:25.560
 dwelling as the essence of all-pervading naked awareness, emptiness. Nermanakaya, Dro-Du-Ling-Pa,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:39.000
 be aware of me. So Dro-Du-Ling-Pa. So Dro-Wand is like the wanderers, the jib, you know,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.440
 the wandering beings, sentient beings of the six realms, it's the Dro. And then the Du-Dru-Dul,

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:57.280
 it implies one who brings peace and calm, tames the wild ones wandering, brings them

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:06.300
 peace and safety and calm. And then the Lingpa is like that, like a pure land, a safe haven.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:21.080
 So the one who brings calm and safe haven to wandering beings is the Nermanakaya, who appears

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:27.640
 in all kinds of ways as a supreme Nermanakaya, such as Guru Rinpoche or Buddha Shakyamuni. But

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:35.200
 ultimately, when we really apply the teachings in the view, everything we experience is the

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:43.120
 blessings of the Nermanakaya Lama. It's the perfect situation for us to wake up, release

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.480
 and purify our misunderstandings and bring out our wisdom and our bodhicitta, make it

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:58.280
 strong and natural. And then again, Dro-Du-Ling-Pa is also a name of the great teacher, Dudram

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:06.140
 Rinpoche, who composed this poem. Dro-Du-Ling-Pa is actually the name he was given when he was

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:18.240
 enthroned by Guru Padma Sambhava and Yashisojo as a turtan. They gave him that name. So Dro-Du-Ling

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.400
-Pa

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:25.560
 comes from the name Besto-Dupandu-Dudram Rinpoche by Padma Sambhava and Yashisojo. And then

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:35.520
 I think later one of his teachers gave him, reaffirmed that name when he entrusted him

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:45.240
 with all of his lineage of teachings. So that's a little bit touching on those questions.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:10.200
 That turtan's name was Zil-Nun Namke Dorje, who also gave, kind of reaffirmed that name

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:19.720
 of Dro-Du-Ling-Pa to Dudram Rinpoche when he enthroned him. And again, that Nermanakaya

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:42.680
 was safe. So those are some of the answers to those little questions. And I just thought

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:50.520
 to add, though, again, getting to that point, just reflecting on the meanings of these teachings

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:58.520
 so beautiful and really bringing it into our practice as we're teaching, as we're practicing,

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:12.040
 stirring those seeds, bringing that big, big view into our minds and hearts, really, truly,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:19.480
 this precious connection we have, like we say, remember the lama, remember the lama,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:27.320
 remember the lama, incomparable kindness, unrepayable kindness, remember the lama.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:38.280
 What could be kinder than someone showing us our true nature and giving us the means for our own

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:48.040
 liberation? There's nothing kinder. It's so true. And that's all wisdom, right? Bringing out our

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:57.800
 wisdom. And then the three kaya state, realizing the three kayas is the ultimate wisdom. It is

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:09.080
 Buddhahood. We study, we contemplate, absorb, absorb the teachings into our practice with our

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:19.640
 meditation. We're introduced to this big view of the nature of things as they are. And then we're

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:27.880
 given means to kind of really become more familiar and see how it's true for ourselves directly

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:39.160
 through our meditation. And that's all supported with our conduct and by doing virtuous deeds,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:51.320
 avoiding negativity, accumulating merit. So wisdom is so that's the essence, bringing out our

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:51.640
 wisdom,

00:34:51.640 --> 00:35:01.160
 but of course it needs those supports of actually studying, contemplating, practicing, meditating,

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:10.120
 bringing out the wisdom. You know, like we kind of referred to before, really bringing

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:16.520
 these four seals of the Buddha's teachings, reflecting on them, seeing how much, just checking

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:23.560
 in with ourselves, how much we're doing that. Again, me, myself at least, am a wandering being

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:33.720
 with aspirations and reverence and devotion, but still a little one, a little wee babe.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:43.640
 But yeah, we have a sense of self being truly autonomous and existing.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:56.360
 So we need to remove that that obscuration, right? It's the cause of samsara, first noble and

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:56.680
 second

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:04.600
 noble truth. And what was the third and fourth to actually find the cessation to realize and see

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:14.360
 things as they are. We assume that all conditioned phenomena is truly existing. And it's not

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:21.800
 according to the teachings, right? But when we begin to use the methods of analytical meditation,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:28.360
 we can begin to bring out that's called wisdom or insight, you know, and seeing how everything's

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:37.640
 impermanent. And that really, we're not going to find ultimate happiness in samsara, we're just not

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:46.440
 because samsara isn't a place. It's a misunderstanding. So really, that's wisdom,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.680
 bringing out our wisdom, so important, our insight, vipashana, supreme seeing.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:04.120
 And the wisdom, right, is just one of the three trainings.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:13.400
 There's also a trainings in proper conduct and concentration. So concentration,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:24.040
 really developing, making sure I'm talking to myself, and encouraging all of us, really do

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.440
 spend time, it sounds kind of so obvious, but I know I find myself, you know,

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:39.960
 distracted and tight and all those things, you know, but really, concentration, shamatha,

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:49.180
 calm abiding, really, really working on developing our concentration is so beautiful and so

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.640
 important.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:56.760
 You know, like Vimala Mitra has a beautiful teaching where he goes through the stages of

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.640
 shamatha and vipashana and the virtues and qualities. But you know, the point is to bring

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:11.960
 out wisdom, but without calming down, you know, due to all of our these misperceptions, I just went

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:21.000
 over, contrary to how things are, you know, we're wandering anxiously, constantly, so easily

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.480
 distracted. It's almost like the that blur is how we can stay identified. You know,

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.480
 it's so kind of contrary to what we really wish, which is peace.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:39.560
 So that's why it's so important in all Buddhist meditation, right, just to remember it really

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:48.690
 bring comes down to shamatha and vipashana in this shamatha, calm abiding, just really, really

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.080
 learning

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:59.560
 how to deeply with our body, with our energy, with our speech, with our mind, relax, but relax

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:07.480
 and stay aware and relax and be able to maintain a focus and to be able to concentrate, which means

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:15.400
 not be distracted. You know, that's like, you know, when we're able to do that, that's like a

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.960
 candle

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:25.640
 or a lamp in a room, that's still, as opposed to like a birthday candle in in the wind, you know.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:33.400
 And by having that really good base, then our vipashana is what's going to really,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:41.560
 like, we can be calm and undistracted and bring out the true insight into the three kaya state.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:52.440
 So just really spend time before, during, checking in with, relaxing, concentrating

00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:01.320
 and opening. The essence of shamatha is holding, the essence of vipashana is

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:09.160
 releasing. And then ultimately, we're doing them both. So that's all I'll say for now. I've really

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:16.280
 talked too long again. I hope this is helpful. So again, it's unrepayable kindness.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:26.360
 Remember the lama. And then when we do our guru yoga, what are we doing? We're receiving all those

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:34.120
 blessings. We're receiving the four empowerments, which are nothing other than in receiving the

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:44.120
 blessings to realize our dharmakaya, our sambogakaya, and our manakaya, and all of them inseparable

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.120
,

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:49.960
 to realize our full Buddhahood is what we're doing when we're doing our guru yoga,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:41:01.800
 resolving that duality. So again, thank you. We'll just for a moment do some silent meditation,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.920
 just reflect, relax. Again, maybe, like I was just mentioning, we can just spend a few moments

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:14.280
 relaxing, again, just having, being mindful of our body's posture. When we have good posture,

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:23.640
 our winds and our energy can move freely. And when our energy can move freely and unimpeded,

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:34.200
 our mind can settle with open senses, letting our concentration here being aware of our body,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:41.320
 supported by the ground, open to the sky, breathing.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:55.400
