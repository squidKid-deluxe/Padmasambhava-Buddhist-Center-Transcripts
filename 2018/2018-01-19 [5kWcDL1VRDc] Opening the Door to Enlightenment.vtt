00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 "Gotans are not there. Even you receive a teaching, even you know all the tools, again, it's just

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.440
 only become an intellectual. It's not really absorbed. You're not connecting to your nature. You're

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.000
 not connecting to the world. The words, lineage of the Muslims."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.940
 This lineage, the Muslims and the comparison of the lineage is like conditions. In order to develop

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:35.240
 the things that are happening, what they need? Cause and conditions. Cause is with us. We, each of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:43.000
 us, have a corporate cause. But every life of the conditions is not going to happen.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.390
 The devotion blessing is, the lineage blessing is the conditions. In order to observe that in the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.000
 heart, to connect to us is the devotions. Then the cause is already with us.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.950
 And then, when the conditions are merged, you talk with the cause, then it will bloom, bloom the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.000
 result. So therefore, devotion is really so important.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.450
 And for that reason, the gracious teacher, Vadakshaktamani, Swaminar said in the time, teaching

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.140
 said, "personally devotion is the role of enlightenment." He said, "The role of devotion is like

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.000
 the role of enlightenment."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 And we close the door of devotion, we close the enlightenment. And then Buddha also said, "vatyapar

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.000
ama," taking in the absolute teacher, He said, "absolute truth must be discovered by the devotions."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.550
 That's it. This is the life of the experienced instructors. The Buddha had completely discovered

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.000
 the enlightenment, because the devotions, encouraging commitment, that really was discovered.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 So therefore, he Buddha said, "What? The absolute truth must be realized by devotees."

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.050
 So this is all. And every those great masters, one after another, one after another, all those

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.000
 relaxed beings, devotion is so important. That's what he said.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.530
 We do the devotion, realization of one's roles. Even we talk sometimes, "Oh, give me blessings, I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 like to have blessings." But it depends on the devotees.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.450
 In order to receive the Australian strength of the blessings that you have to receive, this is

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.000
 imagined by the devotees.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.620
 And we have bigger devotions, we get bigger blessings. And we have the small devotions, we get

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.000
 small blessings.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And we have the medium blessed devotees, we get medium blessings.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.890
 Blessings are measured by the devotees. So therefore, this devotion is so important. It helps for

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.000
 devotees.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.020
 When we have the strong devotees, when we have the joy in the body of the devotees, there is no

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.000
 more than hesitation, doubt, and scepticism.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Humorals are blended in, in that nature. They are immoral. It's beautiful. Therefore, devotion

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 itself, devotion is joy.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.620
 And the feeling of the preciousness, devotion is trust. It's all combined into it. That is what

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.000
 they need, devotion.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So, still, beautiful. Arise up, beautiful devotion. Feel the closeness. Feel the preciousness.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.950
 Be trusted to the lineage. Trust to the teaching. Let that absorb to the heart, not disturbed by

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.000
 doubt and hesitation, this and that things.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 We need that. With those visual thought, and then, such as in the Munro teaching, what is it?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 It is said and called as calling the Lama Paats. If you have time, do those practices.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 That was still called the Lama Paats. Again, it has two meanings. Externally, calling some Lamas,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 operating Lamas.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 But reality is absolute, our own Lamas. We really activate our inner natures.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Beautifulness, glory, the original ground. We activate it, land that Sydney, not that high behind.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 It is called the Lama Paats. Then, this is very important.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Again, this is known as portraying of the mind. Many of you know this. Portraying of the mind.
