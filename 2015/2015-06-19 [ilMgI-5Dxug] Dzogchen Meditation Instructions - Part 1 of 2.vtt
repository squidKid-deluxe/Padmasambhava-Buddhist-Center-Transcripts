00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 As many people, generally, as again we were divided at a different time, ourself, as one of the,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.000
 like, the Gitais, or the Yedamis, or all the Veda Yoginis.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 But that Veda Yogini, again, you can, we can keep, whatever that meaning will be like, we can

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 continually maintain that presence, Gita, if it needs to occur.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.600
 But most of the time, what we are going to want to take more to our mind at this time, meditating

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
 on the nature of the mind.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 I have a similar sense. Burund would come by us.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 And the way we are meditating on the nature of the mind, at that time, also we can, we should med

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.000
itate, or we should proceed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.050
 Every, this universe of all, is also transcend, translucent state. All this universe of all is also

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.000
 as rainbow light state.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Similar as our foundational meditation of ourself as Veda Yogini or Samhana Badri.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 When we are like ourself as Samhana Badri, or the Veda Yogini, is translucent, rainbow body.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.790
 So as it is, this universe of all is translucent and rainbow state. That is what we should

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.000
 visualize.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Again, it is the nature of this phenomenon, this thing, or this world.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Of course, we don't have to realize that in this moment, this Kaveri salt in the Kaveri conflict.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 But reality level, it is translucent state.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 It is like magic, it is like dreams, dream status.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So legalization, what we perceive as, what we realize as rainbow light state is just a way of

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 reconnecting back to the nature as it is.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And that is what it is. And we don't realize that.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 And then more concentrate, or more handle it, meditating on the nature of the mind.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 And nature of the mind already, I think we all know, and that is what is said then relaxed on this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 one present state of mind.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And when you look back to your mind, at that moment, you reach to the nature status.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Nature, there is nothing to grab, nothing to hold, and nothing to really kind of let it see.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.540
 And that is nature status. And we don't anymore, for the more investigate and analyze and act for

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.000
 ideas, relaxing that, and we continue in that status.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And that is, not as then, the present and the active state of mind, the active state of mind.
