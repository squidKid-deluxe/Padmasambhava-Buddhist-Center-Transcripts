00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
 Dzogchen teaching is what is called Dzogchen. Dzogchen is the very word, but it means "Great Com

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.000
pleted,"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.200
 and of course translated "Great Perfection." But if we translate it, Dzogchen word is "Great Com

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.000
pleted."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Great Completed is not small completion. It's not medium completion. It is "Great Completed."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.990
 One is completed. There are many teachings. Entirely Buddha teaching is completed within Dzogchen.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.000
 Entirely that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 It's not just only the basic Buddhist school teachings are completed, or only the Sotr Mahayana is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.000
 completed,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 or only the Vedayana is completed. Entirely Buddha teaching is completed in Dzogchen.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.580
 Therefore, it's called "Great Dzogchen," or "Great Dzogchen." Dzogchen word is not small Dzogchen

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.000
 word.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Dzogchen is not a Dzogchen word. It's not. It's Dzogchen.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And along with that, that means the entire Buddha teaching is complete.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 That means all the practice aspect of the entire teaching, the day one Buddha is teaching,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 the entire Mahabharata, all the practices are completed in Dzogchen teachings.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Everything is completed. And then Dzogchen, with that meaning, while we practice,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 when we practice, there's all practices combined Dzogchen, skillful means and versatile practices.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.400
 Everything is skillful means and versatile practices. That is also completed. Dzogchen, there's

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.000
 nothing is missing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Skillful means practices, complete human practices.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Everything is trying to make one more clarity, clear of the skillful means and versatile practices.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Everything, according to accumulation practices, versatile merit and accumulate humility.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Skillful means practice is the accumulation practice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And the versatile practices is then, or the versatile practices is versatile merit choice.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Or sometimes, versatile merit jury activities and invisible merit jury activities.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And at the very end, the teacher said, "Nam ji, so nam ji, so nam ji, ji, so."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The versatile merit jury activities of the something that we can see,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 that is the merit jury, merit, accumulation merit.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 In visible merit jury activities of the wisdom.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 That is, so this skillful means, versatile are combined token.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Token. That is what the really Dzogchen is.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Dzogchen is not just we are looking one side corner and trying to grab that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 And we do that. Then we are misinterpreting.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And we are not only the full panoramic wheel or panoramic gauntlet.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 We are not really activating the whole panoramic gauntlet of the practice.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 All 360 angles of the practice of the Dzogchen, ignoring them.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Good. Therefore, look in a neat life store of all those great masters.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Masters, when we read the life store of those great masters,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 how they are going to the earth.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Going to the earth.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 How much they are practical.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 How much they have common senses.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 How many they have thought force.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 How many they have respect when you approach it every once.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Yet so humble and so simple.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Don't do the earth. Don't do the earth.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And that means they are keeping perfectly the guidelines of the basic Buddhist school teachings.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Perfect Buddhist teaching guidelines.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 They are not saying I am Dzogchen practitioners and I am going to ignore the Buddhist possibilities

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 or the basic Buddhist teachings.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Or I am Dzogchen practitioners. I don't need Mahayana teachers.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 These are super jhanas.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 They are not saying all combined.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 If we don't do combined, everything, if we could lift it up, we don't.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Then what it becomes?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Then as I say it is, then we become narrow.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 We become skeptical.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Then maybe it will lead us to disappointments.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And then we will fill feelings, spiritual failures.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And we don't want, we like to build up all of them.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Therefore every time in the teaching it is reflecting the four renowned sessions with the devotees.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 These four renowned sessions are points that will change our mind.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And many of you know, I know, I heard that many times.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 But really we know that for now.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Everything really carefully, what are those?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 For example, we call the 18 endowments of the British lives.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 What are the 18 endowments?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Everything, what are those 18 endowments?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Truly we have that.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 But what are those?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Why, a great teacher, Buddha said this 18 endowments, the British life.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 He has principally two meanings, two purposes.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Bring more joy and appreciation, more grateful of the situation and circumstances.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 The same time have the courage and commitment, use this beautiful life.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Meaningful. Meaningful now, meaningful future.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Meaningful now for us, meaningful now for others.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Meaningful us for future, meaningful for others.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 That is the one reason.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 So I'm going to highlight this whole, this 18 endowments.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I'm going to highlight it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Even though many of you know that, some of you know, maybe few of you know, don't heard that.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Me too, I heard this so many times, but I really like that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And that is now, add freedoms, first add freedoms.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And now, what we think, what we are now, who are now, what we are now.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And first is, if I listed those X, first is hill.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And then, hunger ghost.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And then, animals.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And then, long life gods.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And the next one is, then, the barbarians in the teaching said,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 there was a lot of them, a lot of them, many of you know about a lot of them, a lot of them.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And then, next one is, completely, sculpticles.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Sculpticles.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Oh, long time, little bit.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Wrong idea, wrong beliefs.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Sculpticles, that's what you are talking about.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Then is, no bullet.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Bullet never came, or have no, no teaching well, but at all.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Completely.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 So those four, sorry, those add are known as, if we have those add, we are not freedom.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And we are in those, some of those, one of those, all two of those.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And we are completely in that status.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 We are not complete freedom.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Freedom.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 What kind of not freedom?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 We are not freedom to grow our inner realization.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 We don't have opportunities to develop.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Our inner realization, we are completely cold.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Samsara, mundane, habitual, the poisonous, boring qualities.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 We are completely cold.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 We don't have any opportunity to turn our inner, beautiful, glorious qualities.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Or bring up that.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 So therefore, we think, ourselves, think myself now.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 For example, I'm not in helix.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 How great, how beautiful.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Generally, what means?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 It means, six rams is as long, according to the teaching.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Six rams are like our territory that we roam.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 R, O, A, and we roam, according to common wind.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 There's nothing is certainly reserved for us, for all the time.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 We roam.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And that is pushed by the common and common winds.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 So we can be in helix, according to the teaching.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 We can be in hungry glassware.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 We can be in any other glassware situation.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 But now, tell it to ourselves, we're not in that state.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 We're not in those states.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 So therefore, how grateful.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 How beautiful, how spiritual.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 That means, again, in the Buddha teaching, what is it?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 What you did in the past, even though you don't see in the past lives,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 but read your prison situations.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Prison situation will tell what you did in the past.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And even though we don't know the future, future what will happen,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 but read your prison action, activities,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 that will pretty much you can detox.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Or embrace the future, our destination, and about future, our situations.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Therefore, when we have all that, that freedoms,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 that means, truly, we did something quite good.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 This is not just happened by co-accidental.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 It's not just by happiness, by itself.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Truly, it has beautiful cause.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 That cause in the conditions, not given by someone else,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 but as a Lord in us.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 They cannot, they know it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 So that means, we did something good in the past,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 even though we don't know the past or see the past.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 But seeing this, our situation now, on the world,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 on the state, that can judge our past.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 We did quite good.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 That was also virtuous, good activity.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Many times, the teaching said, it's all virtuous activity that you did.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Many good moral and conduct activities that you did in the past.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 That's what it is really like, beautiful life now.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 So therefore, feel happy in the joy and the appreciation of these,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 and have the courage and the commitment to use.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Now, if we have the aiding, these air freedoms,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 then, if we don't have the ten luxuries, again we are missing.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 We have not fully equipped to develop and discover

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 our inner beautiful glories and richness qualities.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Those are the ten luxuries.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Five are connected externally.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Five is connected from supporters,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 and five is connected with one's own son.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 In the Tibetan, the Buddha teaching measured around Yerma and Yerma.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Oh, the luxuries that comes from others

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 and luxuries that comes from one's own son, five luxuries.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Five luxuries from others, five luxuries from one's own son.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Those are the five luxuries.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 These five luxuries, again, of course,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 we know ten, eight endowments that we heard so many times.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And those are also in the books, too.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 The words were my perfect teachers.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 But how much do we care to them?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Maybe we did that one time, but did we remember them?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 That means we did a contemplation endow.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Starting and a contemplation.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Today's endow.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 In a way, they are kind of passing through.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 When you drive in a highway, we see many things from the Lord.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But, just with all this wonderful beauty,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 for all this is not good, but what you see,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 what is just kind of escapes away.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Similarly, when we are reading the books,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 listen to the teachings, many times it kind of escapes away.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 And we are always looking something nugget, nugget, nugget.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 That we lose the ground.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Oh, I like that. I like that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And we started thinking of that,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 mortal karma, not with practical thinking, thinking,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 and following that.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 That we follow with our consortium ego clings.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 According with our teaching, from the beginning of this time until now,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 what we ended up or what we are now, that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 All ego-cling activities, we like ego-cling activities.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 We don't say, "I don't like that ego-cling activities."

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Never say, "We like ego-cling."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 "I love, I like this, this, that."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And kind of that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 But at a reality level, what do we really go to?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Always worry, always stressful, always un-goutful, always no rest.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And then also that reflects according to the teaching,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 to the physical condition, in the environmental situation.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And it's always something wrong, always something missing,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 always something wrong.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 That we own is the ego-resolve.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 We are flagging with ego-clicking.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 So now, with this understanding, we should really, again,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 highlight this, because while I am talking this,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 the ego-clicking is, as I said many times, you all know,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 and we learn from the great masters all the time,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 it's the greatest teaching.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And also we have to attain reflectivity.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 It's very important, the ground issues, ground qualities,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 the foundations, it's important.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 So now, the five lectures from the others is,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 first one is, Buddha came, at least the first part,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 and then go there, all that.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 And first parts are, Buddha came to this goal.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And the second is, Buddha gave the teachings.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And the third is, teachings are still existing.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 And then, the fourth is, still there's many practitioners

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 who practice.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And then, not just the practice, and the fifth one is,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 there's also the teacher available, qualified teachers available.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 So those are known as five luxuries from the others.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Why is he using that?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And according to Buddha's teaching, there is some eons,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Buddha never comes, so there's no Buddha.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Those are in Buddhism, named eons of the dark, darkness eons.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 There is no Buddha came.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So we are not that happy.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 For us, it's not Buddha came.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 We are the eons of light.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And actually in the Buddha's teaching, so this eon is not fortunate eons.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 We are one of those fortunate eons, experienced, or captured,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 one who capture them.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 This is not just fortunate eons.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Outside, I saw that.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 We are out of that fortunate eons.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 So Buddha came, Buddha kept him when he came,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 two thousand, six hundred years ago, according.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 I'm a different chronology system, but I cannot believe that.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And then, even Buddha came in this world.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Sometimes, Buddha don't give teachings.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 They called him.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Even Buddha came like teachings.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And so that also happened.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 For example, Buddha's left first, like he conquered,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 when he left the kingdom, kingdom, kingdom,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 kingdom, kingdom, kingdom, kingdom.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So Buddha came, Buddha came in this world.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 And so, Buddha came, Buddha came in this world.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And so, Buddha came in this world.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000

 And so, Buddha came in this world.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And so, Buddha came in this world.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And so, the santa members, we have similar idea, similar will, similar will, similar goal.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 It was all so supportive, so beneficial, so helpful to the longer part.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 We have that.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And that is what really is so beautiful.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Then, even the santa members, if there is no qualified teachers or teachers available,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 there must still be, we are not completely equal, equal.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 And that is not what we are.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 We have all met so many great masters.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 One after another.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 We can select, we can choose, you know.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 How fortunate, how lucky we are.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Really, all of them.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Those all known as luxury, that comes from others.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Then, you know, others outside.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Then there is five luxuries, one's own, own self.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Ones that are related with our own self.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And again, our listed.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 First, being born as human beings.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Partly human beings.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And the second is, is all the organs and senses are clay and intact.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And born where there is teachings available.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Third is, we are born to teach.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 And then fifth is, our professional activity is not complete,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 not completely, kind of like reverse our practice.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 So our professional job or our activity is kind of lined up with it quite now.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And the fifth one is, devoted to the teaching.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Devoted to teaching.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 So that, we have that.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Partly we are born as human beings.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Human beings.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Which is so wonderful.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Human beings.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 According to the Buddha teaching, there is so many beings of the six realms.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 But human being is so special.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 It has great opportunities to develop and grow and discover our beautiful beings.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Perfect.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Perfect.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Kind of like connections to the skull.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Right?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Right?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 And we saw how we don't have that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So that therefore, we should grateful that we are born as human beings.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 As I said, any of you know that.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And the second is being as human.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And the second is, then all the senses are.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Senses are perfect.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 We are very intelligent in senses.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 And the third.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Born where there is teaching available.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Even there are human beings.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 If there is no teaching available, even you learn to practice this.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Then it's kind of stuck.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It's stuck.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 You don't have that.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 There are all these opportunities.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And that happened many times.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Many times we received some emails.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 I'm so sorry that we don't have any teachers.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 But the new teachers in this area, could you help me?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 We received those through the emails.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 So this is definitely going to happen.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 And then our professional job, the activity,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 is something also completely not negative.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Whatever we do, we do something kind of lined up.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 It happens to others, it happens to ourselves.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 And which is good, very sweet.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 And then, the fifth one is a devotee done.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Now everything of all that eating endowments, eating endowments,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 first of all, at freedom is so special.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 At freedom.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Above that, there are ten lunches.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Last two are out of ten lunches.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 So that means, two are from the lunches from others.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Last two are the lunches from one's own self.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 It's so special.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So lunches.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Last two are from others.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 What are those?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 That there's a sangha and there's teachers.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Yeah.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 If we don't have, even all the rest, we have luxuries, then we stop.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 That is again the rarest or rarest than last two lunches.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Then from our luxuries, last two are again rarest.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Rare, it's very precious.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Last two are again from our sangha to those two.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 That we have faith and interest in the dharma.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 That's it.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And that, that last two are.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 And we completely can't have the wrong occupations, wrong professional jobs.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 They're completely cold.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Even if we have every situation we devote, that then is nothing.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 And then, particularly, the last one is devotion and pain.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 If we don't have the pain, the devotion, the motivation,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 no matter how many luxuries you have, nothing's going to happen.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 That is not.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 So therefore, if we look at every of those add freedoms, how fortunate I am.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 If we look at every of those add five luxuries of others, how fortunate we are.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 And if we look at every of these five luxuries of one's own son,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 how fortunate we are.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Truly, really good.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 So those are known as eating endowments.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Then, I will talk one, just list it.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 List the names of the days.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And add temporarily, or suddenly arising.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Arising obstacles to our freedoms.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Those are the great masters, Unhiba Listing.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 First is tomato, raging emotions of the five bosoms.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Tomato.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And very dull, second is very dull, and the mind is completely blown up.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 That is second.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 And third is completely associated with wrong negative friends.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Thaar.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 And the port is very heavy laziness.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Laziness, very heavy laziness.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And third is, and so many bad garments coming one after another.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Those are known as in the Buddha teaching, suffering after suffering.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 One after another, suffering after suffering.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And then seventh is, you are completely controlled by the power of others.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Others.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 All as the slavery, slavery is all this.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Completely kind of slavery.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And fourth is, sorry not fourth, and is, returning the practice.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Or in other words, hypocrites of the practitioners.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Kind of returning the practices.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Again, even we have the eating endowments perfectly, beautifully,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 but at those camps, then we are losing those luxury scholars.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 We are damaging the luxury scholars.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 So therefore, again, courage and commitment, confidence,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 and with strong devotion, keep up, be held up, strong.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And emotion comes, all those, you receive all the teachings.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Apply to those techniques.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Whatever the emotions are disturbed, not chasing after them.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Emotions. Chasing after the emotions.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Then that is what the gracious teacher, Buddha used examples.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Chasing the stone by the doghis.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Droving through the stone to the doghi,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 and many times, drop chasing the stones.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 So if we chase the emotions, it goes on and on.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 So they have activated the teachings there.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And then when the kind of lady or this dullness, stupid things,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 please stand in that courage and commitment

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 and do the practice, such as the magickities,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 or something like that, lighten our heart and mind.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 In a verse, we all have the inner verse.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 There is no difference, according to what I teach you.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Buddha nature is everywhere, just going to begin to shine.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 We are going to shine out fully with that.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Every removal of the kind of process to remove the habit of patterns.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So therefore, kind of restate and study, even though it's difficult.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Starting, meditate.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 And they didn't want to do the accumulation, meditate practices.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Sacrum embolises, ostriches, cleaning the temples,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 shrines, like beautiful arrangements.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 There's a beautiful story that you know in the Buddha's time.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Buddha is one of the Arhathas,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 who is now among one of the 16 Arhathas in the Buddha teaching.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 But when he was born, he was so dumb, dumb, dumb,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 that he don't remember anything.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 When he teach something, when he teach that one verse teaching,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 the first verse you teach, the first verse of one line teach,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 and when the second line comes, the first one completely forget it.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And the second line, the third line comes,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 he completely forgets the second one.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Like that kind of a sentence.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Don't do anything.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 There's beautiful stories, I won't tell those enough.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Maybe you heard that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But at the end, what Buddha did?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 He said, he can't do anything.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Anything.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 But yet he become the monk.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 He will learn the monk, because he's so desperate situation.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 He's barely died.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 His house, his family completely gone,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and they just become one after another tragedy happened.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Then he just like little boy there, hanging on the street,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 and he never know where to go, what to do.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And the great teacher Buddha came,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 particularly Shari Buddha,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 as they come to follow us and say that he feels so happy,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 and he thought to give teaching,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 but when he give teaching, he don't remember,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 he don't know anything.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And then what great teacher Buddha said,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 "And you know how to clean the temple?"

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 He said, "Yes, I know that."

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So he start to clean the temple.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 The temple of the Sharasta,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 or the other girls cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 He's cleaning.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Very diligently, beautifully cleaning that.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 And because the mandatory activity in the Buddha's blessings,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 and he relaxes, finally start singing the song of the realizations.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 This cleaning is not cleaning of the dirt,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 cleaning of the poison.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 This not cleaning is not cleaning of the fire,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 it's cleaning of the, again, impure.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 [Hindi]

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Singing that, everybody thought,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 "How do you got that knowledge?"

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 He said, "It happened."

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So then, it is with more teaching.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Soon he become one of the great Arathas,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 and he is one of the 18 Arathas.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 The sickling Arathas, that's the really how it is.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 So therefore, this is the,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 I may hope that you can develop.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 It's even though there is a limit.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And then, the negative friends.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 So many times, it's always called as a friend.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 But our way of thinking,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 and our conduct, way of their thinking,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 the way of their conduct is quite opposite.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And opposite, we did virtues, we did dharma.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 So therefore, again, trying to watch out.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 They have always a spiritual friend.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Sangha friend is so important.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 So important, so precious.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 So those are, then I can go maybe later in future.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 So those are, generally, I told you about this precious,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 what's it called?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Four, these four points.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Four points that change our reverse, our mind.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And so that we can use some of that.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 I spoke today, really, and highlighted it,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 of the meaning of the endowment step.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 And now, we will go to the next slide.
