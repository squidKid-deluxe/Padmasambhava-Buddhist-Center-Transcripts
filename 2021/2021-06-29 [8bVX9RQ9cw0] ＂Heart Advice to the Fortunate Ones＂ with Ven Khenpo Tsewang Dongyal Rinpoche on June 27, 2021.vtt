00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 Thank you very much everyone again for the type of participation as I said quite a few

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 times and thank you very much for again gathering together, again discussing the teachings of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.760
 our gracious kindness, compassion teacher of the Buddha Shakyamunus. His teachings are

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.360
 love, loving kindness, compassion, non-volence, respect and appreciation for all the living

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:40.520
 beings. That is equal. That is his message, his teachings. And we are all following this

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 teaching according our capabilities with joyful effort, courage and commitment and confidence

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.640
 drawn to the earth and moving, toward, leaning toward. According to Buddha's teaching in

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 Buddhism, what we are doing together is one of the very beautiful things, beautiful, really

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.680
 can do in our lives, the precious lives. We have so many things to do in the world, so

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.040
 many, so many schedules, so many activities lined up one up and there is endless. But

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.800
 among all that, to activate that love, joy, appreciation, respect with compassion for

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.440
 all living beings is truly according Buddhism, is a reward. A reward to ourself, reward to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 the others. That is what in the teaching said, you are making the meaning of our lives. We

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.440
 are making the meaning of our lives. It is not just this what we are doing, loving, according

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.080
 to teaching, we are not just going to leave behind with our old material, existing wealth.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 When we leave this world, we go with this, according to teaching that will assure our

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.600
 old, unknown destinations. It really will make sure your passage, our passage, not just

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.640
 yours, our passage will be bright, confidence, calm, peaceful, as we are practicing what

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.080
 these teachings. This teaching of the Buddha is nothing any special or extraordinary or

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.800
 something different. It's our basic nature, love, kindness, compassion, respect and appreciation.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.200
 That is goodness of ourself. What gracious teacher Buddha highlighted, he put so many

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 beautiful ways to activate it that we can go in that treasure, our treasure on the box.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.960
 Why we need that? Because due to our habit patterns, due to our must-understandings, we

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:19.200
 are always looking at the solutions outside, outside, outside, outside and less. According

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.720
 to Buddha teaching, we've been doing this from the bigger, less times, beginning less

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.520
 times. We've been doing that continuously. We will do that continuously, looking at solutions

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:42.160
 outside. But what we got? Still a dilemma, still felt force, I'm not sure, doubt and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:53.440
 hesitation, the scepticals, scepticals and uncomfortable, un-feastful. Really, always

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.800
 we've been, it's not just pure us, we've all been in that situation. But when we're

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.960
 touching to our own goal of true nature, true nature as Buddha taught, we do that, really.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:19.120
 It is very rewarding, it brings confidence, courage and commitment. Yet, at the same time

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:29.560
 we become more sensible, more thoughtful to ourselves and as well as our friends and family

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:41.240
 members and respect. That's what we want. We like to be harmony, peace, joy, kind, nice.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.960
 That's what we want. This is what we're practising. What we're discussing, it really will bring.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.840
 You can witness why ourself, we can witness ourself. So those are, we kind of like highlight

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.120
 thought with that and then again in the teaching always reactivate our motivations, such as

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.040
 joy and appreciation. And then both each other, thought for all living beings, that we all

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:18.000
 know. We heard, intellectually we all know. But how much really we absorbed those teachings

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.760
 to our heart, we can test ourself. We can witness to our own self how much I observed

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.800
 the body get us to my heart and mind. We can test, test. And together with that, then in

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:49.440
 Vedayana teaching always bring the purity realizations or open the door to the purities. According

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:57.800
 Vedayana teaching, everything is divine mandalas or mandala of enlightenment. Everything, both

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.400
 subject and object. But we don't realize that. We don't know that. Now, why? Because we are

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:16.200
 so narrowed mind, our duality is just a habit, a pattern is ticked and we become so regimented.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:24.280
 Our nature of the mind is open. There's no boundaries. There's no restrictions. Now,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:34.640
 our mind, I'm talking, your mind and my mind has no boundaries, no restrictions. But yet,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:43.560
 we make boundaries. We make restrictions. Ourself is nobody made a restriction and loaded to

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:55.600
 us. We did it. Then it narrowed our understanding and thinned our understanding. T-H-I-N, I

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:04.080
 believe, thinned. It just becomes so small. We are looking our knowledge of what we have now. It's

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.760
 looking through the hole of the sasmi seed, looking through. That's knowledge what we have.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:23.040
 Reality is open to everyone. No one is occupied. There is no registered and copyrights at all.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:32.960
 It's open widely. Then we don't see. We're looking through that hole of the sasmi seed and what we

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:41.970
 see. Always the same thing. Drought and hesitation and reflection of the ego clings and self-

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.440
important,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:50.040
 self-centered mind. That's what we did. That's what we see. That's what we experience. That's

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.850
 what we are. For that reason, the religious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said, "Bring up the purity."

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.160
 The

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.760
 entire thing, everything is in purity status. It's not just something we are making of the purity.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:14.240
 It is ordinary nature. That's really in the teaching seat. Bring those. At least now we bring up

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.520
 those

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.960
 thought. It's our practices. That's what we will bring us to the perfection states. Practice makes

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:31.000
 perfect. So with this, again, we follow with our again great teacher, the embodiment of all the

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.960
 Buddhas were three times of His Holiness, the jhana bhuchas. His teaching, which is essence

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:44.400
 teachings of the practices of the Buddhas teaching, entire Buddha teaching. That means what?

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:53.640
 From age, Buddha gave the age, age 35. Age 35, he started giving the teaching until age 81. This

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:02.280
 simple page is essence of all those teachings. Really, it's all teaching. So simple, so directed,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:11.720
 so pointing out. And that's what we really follow me. We went slowly by slowly, kind of like,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:19.600
 went according our time and yet we explored. A lot of things according our capabilities.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.000
 The old is a line of the teachings, teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.200
 and as well as in Gurba and Sambhava, lineage masters. We really went those. According our

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:39.240
 capabilities, went one after another. And today, again, we are going on this. So what we are now,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:47.580
 and here, I like the teaching, there is poor wealth of the practitioners. Poor wealth. We

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:54.600
 discussed that. We went through those, each of those. Those started page, I mean, many of you

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 already participated. We went through this page, this page one, the last line of the page one. So

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.320
 those are what? What for wealth? Devote you to the root teacher, and the love and affection to all

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.600
 the

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.840
 various brothers and sisters, all the old beings, and then compassion of the body for all living

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:28.400
 beings and understanding of the impermanent. Those are known as the treasures of the practitioners.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:36.280
 Why is the treasure? Because if we have this treasure, our practice with dharma will be so

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:44.080
 rich. When, for example, many practitioners are, their practices are fading away. Almost they're

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:52.640
 going to retire their practices. But if we have this poor wealth, dharma practices will be always

00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:02.900
 fresh, always rich, always with abundances of all good results. And what abundance? Confidence,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:10.040
 abundance of confidence, abundance of the joy, abundance of the appreciations, abundance of the

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:17.760
 devotions, abundance of love and compassion, compassion, and abundance of the energetic to

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:28.200
 practices, not fading ways, not just going down or expiring or retiring. It's everlasting, really

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:38.600
 ours. Therefore is called wealth. This wealth we need all the time. From the day one we practices,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.920
 all the way to under enrich enlightenment. And during the meditation or practicing time,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:54.920
 and as well as during the post meditations, we keep this wealth as much as we become more

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:03.080
 and more rich of our abundance or the spiritual call it or dharma or realizations, really will

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:10.640
 become. And among that, what we discussed last time about the impermanent. Impermanent is something

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:10.640
,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:19.480
 subject looks like so casual, so ordinary, so basic. But reality, according Buddhism, the imper

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.960
manent

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:26.600
 is the big subject, big teaching, not just the subject. It's touching to the core of the nature,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:36.820
 core of the realities. Many teaching master said, said this is also this impermanent is one of the

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:44.400
 extra only teaching of our greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. The net does not spark clearly

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.080
 by any other great teachers. This is his extra only one of the teachings. When you have the

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:59.040
 realization of this impermanent, you have no difficult to understand of what in Buddhism

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:09.640
 is talking emptiness, emptiness realization come so easily according to teaching. When you have the

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:17.400
 impermanent realization, those of we discussed the last time, impermanent, subtle impermanent,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:26.760
 and gross impermanent, we sentient beings only know or only detected gross impermanent.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:38.640
 Gross impermanent, that also we don't detect until it come to end. That we know, because our

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.920
 knowledge is gross. As I said earlier, our knowledge is looking through the sasmi seed,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:57.880
 whole of the sasmi seed. Realitally, everything is in this impermanent or this nature. Impermanent

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:06.760
 is nothing bad. It's nothing something that we losing something. It starts forming, merging,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:16.600
 reactivating. That's what the progress comes. If there is no permanent, impermanent, there's no

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:28.270
 progresses. There's no change. Change is all that. That changing and moving is sub-continuous

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.960
 happening.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:39.440
 That is what is known as in the Buddha's teaching, interdependent coordination or interdependent,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:51.040
 ever use simple word, interdependent. Why they call that? Because it's one single entity not

00:14:51.040 --> 00:15:05.320
 it driven away anything. One entity, one material, one material, or one particle has nothing can do

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:05.320
.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:18.520
 It's all cooperated. Even one particle has so many particles, according. It's all cooperated. Yet,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:26.440
 they're all changing, changing, cooperating so perfectly. That's what things are developing.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:33.520
 So therefore, the greatest teacher, Buddha said, interdependent. They're all interconnected,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.640
 interdependent. That's where things are happening. When you see that interdependent,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:45.400
 that means that there is nothing substantially solid existing. For that reason, in Buddhism,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:56.160
 what's called is all display, is all magics, is all dreams, this all bubbles, this all mirages,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:05.480
 to bring, to bring that, to ring that in our head or our mind. The teacher uses those all examples,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:13.880
 or reflection moon in the waters. It's not just a Buddhist dogma. This is not just a Buddha making

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:23.440
 up that. It is. And that even now, modern physics, quantum physics is proving. I understand, I

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:23.720
 heard,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:33.040
 that I'm sure you know more than that. Proving, not just intellectually proving. According to

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.440
 Buddhism,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.240
 when you have the realization, but it's supposed to be booming, you see things,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:56.440
 exactly in the nugget eye. That's known as seeing part. Seeing, C-E-S, sorry, S-E-I-N-G, I think so

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.560
,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:09.880
 C. S-E-I-N-G, maybe. But you understand so what I'm talking, and that's more important. Seeing part

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:09.880
,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.920
 or beholding. You're beholding. What are you really beholding? You've seen the nature,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:27.040
 exactly as it is without theory, without intellectual, without the conceptions. Now you see. You

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.240
 want

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.520
 you to start to intellect, or intellectually analyze, or got something, idea, and that,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:44.840
 presumption, whatever you got, now you proved. We proved. That's called seeing part. Part. Still,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:52.800
 even the part, even you see, according to Buddhism, still we're going to advancing. Co-op that. So,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.920
 those are the things. So those are generally about the impermanence. The other day we discussed

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.920
 already that. But now this is gross impermanence, seeing that everything is impermanent. Imper

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.880
manent,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.920
 according to Buddha's teaching, what great teacher Buddha said, "If you make offerings to my the

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.800
 most

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.820
 noble disciples such as Harry Potter, Mongol Potter, to make offerings all the time for so many,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:26.890
 for a long time, have you started thinking of the impermanent for one moment, which has more power

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:27.040
?"

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:36.520
 Buddha said, "It has more power to think of the impermanent than making gifts offering to

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:43.000
 Harry Potter and Mongol Potter," so forth. How you can see how much Buddha highlighted, how

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.280
 emphasize of this importance of this. For that reason, many always in the teaching mentioned,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.160
 this impermanent is so important. What he does immediately when we had the impermanent, it was

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:04.400
 losing our grasping, clinging, our ego clingings. Really loosen up because the ego cling is so

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.240
 tight and so regimented. When you have that impermanent thought, you're close to nature.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:20.520
 And therefore, the strength and the identity of the ego is also going down. Self-important is going

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:29.400
 down. And when that happens, what comes up? Love, kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation to

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:37.980
 ourselves, one's own self to others really will grow. That is what, for those reasons, always in

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.960
 the teaching said, for example, in our practice teaching, Mundo practices, there's four renour

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:52.840
 sessions or four points that will reverse our grasping mind, mind from samsara to the dharma.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:02.120
 Those four points, one is impermanent, reflecting those impermanent. For that reason, famous master

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:12.320
 known as Karagomchung. Karagomchung is very famous and put away in all those ancient time or 11th,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:19.160
 12th century master of the Kadam schools of the Tibetan Buddhism. Kadam schools. And Karagomchung,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:27.400
 and many master said Karagomchung was practicing of the Dzogchen and as well as Kadam teachings

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:34.280
 that come from articias practicing. But in their teachings and what they said, if you have the

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:45.680
 impermanent thought the first time, it will help us bring the fed. F-A-T-H, fed. It will make us

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:54.690
 bring fed in our heart. If you have the impermanent knowledge, impermanent, it will help to

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.520
 practicing

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:06.590
 the dharma. Suppose it will help to bring the fed. Second, it will help to practice the dharma. If

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.840
 you

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:13.680
 continue to keep that impermanent knowledge, it will help to accomplish or fulfilment of the

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:21.980
 practices. Practices. That's what this great master says. And also in the teachings said, if you

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.160
 have

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:32.720
 the impermanent or knowledge of impermanent, it will help to assure us to the dharma. Assure us to

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:40.720
 the dharma and break down the clingsings to the samsaras, everything. And if you continue to keep

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:49.400
 the impermanent, it will help to activate our joyful effort. It will bring more joyful effort. Joy

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400
ful

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:58.130
 effort to the virtues, to the dharma. If you continue to keep this impermanent, it will help to

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.400
 bring

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:09.120
 the wisdom in our realisation. So the impermanent is so important every way for that reason. I mean

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.120
,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.040
 because it is touching the knowledge of the impermanent, touching to the goal of a way

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.720
 this relates to the art, relates to the ease. So those are, for that reason, this is known as all,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:30.880
 those all together, is wealth of the practitioners. Wealth. So up to that is what we discussed.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.720
 Now we do, so therefore what he said here, here, are known as the poor, ever-lasting wealth of the

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:48.320
 practitioners and should be regarded as indispensables. Indispensables. Indispensables. What that

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.040
 means,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:56.880
 as I said already early in this book, keep this poor wealth, every occasion,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:06.000
 during the practice occasions and during the post-practice occasions. And we keep this,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.680
 we will be so practical. We will become very practical and will become more, it will bring us

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:26.470
 more sensible understand, or more senses, and we, more common senses, and it will bring really very

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480
,

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:34.160
 very kind of practical, it will bring us, it will make us very practical. Sensible practicals,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:41.600
 something harmony, peaceful in this life, but same time it will provide us a big support

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:50.880
 to our destination in the future. So those are the, the teaching we go. Now we go to the next one.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:58.160
 This next one, from this, this from here, the middle of this, "Lama and the Yedams are inseparably

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:07.840
 one's own mind. From that on is all that to end is now teachings, essence teachings of the

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.920
 inner Tantras." Inner Tantras. What are those inner Tantras? Of course you all know. I will list

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.080
 the

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:23.600
 names. That is Mahayoga Tantra, Anu-Yoga Tantra, Inner Tantra. So this is the essence of the

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:31.040
 practices of all inner Tantras. So that means what we've been discussing until now is the

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:38.560
 foundation of the practices, foundation of practice of the inner Tantras. Once we have this,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.240
 then we, as we, we receive the teaching, and then we begin to practice of these following links.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:54.480
 The force among that is here, what? Said the Lama. The Lama and the Yedams,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:03.520
 "Yedams are inseparable from one's own mind." That's, according to the Vijayana teaching,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.400
 there's always have the synonyms of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. Different name. That means a

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:20.720
 different name that you all, you know. Those are known as the Guru, Diti, Dakinis, or in it very

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:29.760
 old, Lama, a Yedam, and a Khandros. Those are. What in the teaching said, all the great masters

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:41.120
 always said, "Lama is root of blessings, and a Yedam is root of accomplishment, and a Dakini

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:49.920
 is root of all the fulfillments or the activities." Root, again, I'm sure you know that,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:59.280
 my non-section, that, but R-O-O-T, I believe, root. Also, I can change the root, maybe some others,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:09.840
 terminologies. Root, instead, root, source. Source. So, Lama is source of blessings.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:22.400
 Yedams are source of accomplishment, and Dakinis are source of activity of fulfillment. So,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:30.000
 those are ways. So, those are the four, sorry, three. And they are, according, again, in the

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.960
 teaching said, synonyms of the Buddha, Dharma, Sanghams. So, how that happens? According to the

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:46.960
 teaching said, Lama represented, for example, Lama represented the Buddha, if we say one, one,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:56.480
 one, three different. And the Yedam represented Dharma, and Dakini represented the Sangha members.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.320
 So, those are three kind of groups. Lama represented, Lama is a Tibetan word,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:14.520
 which is Sanskrit, Guru. Guru represented Buddha, and Diti represented Dharma, and Dakini or Khand

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:14.960
roma

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.920
 represented Sangha members, that is. And then in the teaching said, even the Lama,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:34.960
 Lama alone is represented all those three, what also all three? Lama, Diti, and Dakini,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:42.400
 they are all presented by the Lama. And how that is? According to the teaching said,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:59.680
 Lama, they say, the realization of Lama, and realization of Lama, representing the,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:10.400
 presenting the Yedams, and in activities of the Lama is representing the Dakinis.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:19.410
 And the Lama, that him or herself represented the Sangha members. Or maybe I didn't do it the

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:19.600
 correct

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:26.160
 way yet. If I say more again, one, one, one more time, one time, one more time. And Lama

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:35.280
 representing as, again, Lama represented Lama. Lama, all Lama represented, the external Lama

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:44.320
 represented Sangha members. And the teaching of Lama, represented Sangha. And as well as

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:52.560
 realization of the Lama, represented Buddhas. So that way, Buddha, Dharma, Sanghas. I think

00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:01.440
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and Guru, Deva, Dakinis. Dakinis in that way is that. And then what it is,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.760
 again, Lama, we're talking now, Lama. And Lama is a teacher. Other day, we discussed about the

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:17.120
 qualified of the Lamas. Generally, we also went, there's four groups of the teachers. Lama means,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:25.120
 if I translate it now, teacher, teacher. So there's four groups of the teachers, according

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:33.840
 to the Buddha teaching. There's many. But fourth one is teacher, the Dharma, sorry, Sambukhaya,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:42.800
 Kayas. Group Sambukhayas are known as also teachers. Second group is the Nama Kaya Buddhas

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:51.040
 are known as also teachers. Third is the great Bodhisattvas.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:03.200
 Groups are known as teachers. The fourth group is then, other day, I may be mentioned ordinary

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:10.400
 teachers. But if I translate it more kind of a simple way, the groups of the human teachers.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.960
 So human teacher. So that means how many groups, how many teachers? Human teacher,

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:27.120
 Bodhisattva teachers, Nama Kaya teachers, and Sambukhaya teachers. Among those four teachers,

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.760
 what we have the capabilities to connect with, most time is human teachers.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:45.280
 Bodhisattva teachers also difficult to us to find, find really, truly. And Nama Kaya Buddhas

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.760
 even more difficult to find. And Sambukhaya teachers even more difficult, according to

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.280
 the Buddha's teaching, those who have the capability to receive the teaching from Sambukhaya,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:05.040
 Sambukhaya Buddha, they have to be in the highest stage of the path. At the path, ninth path,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:16.960
 and tenth bhoomi path. At the bhoomi, ninth bhoomi, tenth bhoomis. Those they can receive. For us,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:23.680
 is that the human teachers. That's what we can connect with most of us.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:31.360
 Maybe some have the capability to connect with those higher ones. But mostly, it's human teachers.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:38.800
 For that reason, in the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni gave those old qualifications.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:45.040
 Even as a hoomi teacher, it needs qualifications. We went through those last time.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:52.320
 Qualifications of the accorded Buddha's teaching, Vinaya teaching, Mahayana teaching,

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.320
 Vajrayana teaching, we went three groups, even though there's so many explanations and all that

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:06.880
 qualification of the teachers, we went through those, one after another. Most all those we also

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:14.560
 summarized, while as a great master, Jungkook Unruh said in the teachings, those are all

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:23.200
 qualifications are what he said. Those five or four or five, I've listed this, I said early.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:35.760
 The fourth one is one who has the vows and the samayas, one who is keeping

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:43.920
 vows and the samayas and have the moralities. So that means conduct. Some always say,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:55.280
 have good conduct. That is one. Second, that teacher has lineage teachings, unbroken lineage

00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:01.680
 teaching from the Buddha Samad Bhadra or from the Buddha Shakyamuni, to Guru Moochai, to all the

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:10.000
 Vinayas who had lineage teachings, lineage teachings, teachings on that. So that is second.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:21.440
 Third is that lineage teaching is not diluted, not spoiled, not scared or stained, pure lineage.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:30.960
 Third, fourth one is who has knowledge of all the teachings and also knowledge of the practices,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:39.200
 practice not just only knows, but practitioners, keeping the teaching with the practices,

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:48.960
 both scriptural and realization levels. And that is in a debate called Long Togwa,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:57.520
 Long Chu Togwa, keeping up practices. And the last one has great compassion.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:04.400
 Bodhijata, that means have the compassion, concern, caring,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.320
 thoughts for all the beings with the great compassion. Those are the great master,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:20.880
 Jungkung Kuntra, who has summarized that, he's highlighted that. So that is the qualification.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:28.400
 If you see that qualified teacher, then or great master, what Shanti Deva said,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:35.360
 even true, he said, I said those things before. And again, I will say true. The teacher,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:46.160
 the qualified teacher, we should stay with the vows. Vows of the bodhisattva vows,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:55.760
 keeping the bodhisattva vows across their lives. That vow, that means courage, commitment,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:04.560
 determination, and keeping up the vows. What vow actually, bodhijata vow? It means vows of

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.320
 the bodhijata is wishing bodhijata, actualizing bodhijata vows, keeping up that. So that is the

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:22.320
 ground one. And then second, the one who knows the mayana teachings, all the teachings, if I say,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:32.960
 all the teachings, that true, call it, at the call it, or true, that true, at the call it of the

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:42.400
 human teachers. That's what really great master Shanti Deva said. So those are all. But when you

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:51.920
 see that teacher, teacher then, and what about here, here, here, here, here, see that this lama and

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:59.840
 yidam are inseparable from one's own mind. So that qualified teacher is so special and so important

00:35:59.840 --> 00:35:59.840
,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:07.770
 but yet, we according to Vajrayana teaching of the zokti level, then qualified teacher is no other

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.320
 than

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:17.280
 one's own mind. Nature of the mind is representing of their qualified teachers. That means to have

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:25.280
 that realization, we maintain also same time vows or this bodhijata vows or the vows of the

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.000
 teachings

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.560
 according what you receive. At the same time, your devotion, your courage, and the commitment to

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:32.720
 the

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:39.280
 practice of dharma, and then, when you succumb to the meditation, the practice, and then teacher

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:48.960
 is no other than them, and one's own nature of the mind. And teacher, the nature of the mind is not

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:57.840
 just only the teacher, essence of teacher, but here, said His Holiness, also is nature of one's

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:06.960
 own mind is essence of the yidam deities. That also indicated nature of the mind is also essence of

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.200
 the

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:18.320
 dakinis. So this, our own mind, nature of the mind is embodiment of the guru, deity, and dakinis.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:29.730
 That is what it is. And how that is? According to the teaching, again, the realizations of the guru

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:29.840
,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:37.120
 the realization where the realization actually happening is in the mind. The mind,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:49.680
 that nature of the realization is dharma. This is as well as is the Buddha's.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:38:00.160
 So therefore, what in the teaching said, again, nature of the mind, emptiness aspect of nature

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:10.800
 of the mind is dharmakaya, Buddha's, dharmakaya or lama dharmakayas. Clarity aspect of the nature

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:22.400
 is lama sambhukaya, lamas. This aspect of the nature of the mind is narmakaya, lama or the dakini

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:34.320
 of the lamas on dakinis. So that means emptiness, clarity, and the display of our mind is

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:47.200
 Buddha, dharma, sangha, and guru, deva, dakinis, and dharmakaya, sambhukaya, and narmakaya,

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.400
 all those things within this nature of the mind. So that is, how are we going to see that?

00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.800
 According to the teaching said, for example, now you begin to practice when you practice,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:07.440
 and first you do follow exactly instructions what you received, and do all those your

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.480
 lineage prayers, and then you do also Kundal practices. As this is so important,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:20.960
 Kundal practice. So practice that. And that is, we visualize at that time, externally

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:28.880
 guru, and guru who is embodiment of the, such as embodiment of all the gurus,

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:36.160
 is gurup and masambhava. That we meditate above or in front of you, above your head,

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:43.360
 or above our head, and in front of our head. We visualize. Gurup and masambhava, and we also,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:49.440
 and then in, above the head, Gurup and masambhava, or on the top, on the, in the sky,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:55.920
 and then we can meditate all the lineage masters of the masters, lineage masters.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:03.840
 Those in the Inma schools of the Buddhism, are three lineages. Mind to mind, or lamas of the mind

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:10.240
 to mind transmission lineages. And lamas of the sambole transmission lineages. Lamas of the

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:16.560
 other transmission lineages. Then in the, those are the general lineages. And pacifically,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:23.760
 in Inma, hidden treasure line, lineage. There is three addition lineages. That means, then

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:31.280
 it makes six lineages. And those are first, first it is known as, is lineage of the, of the

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.680
 appointment and the predictions. Lineage of the appointment and the predictions. Those I'm

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:51.360
 translating. Kava, lungthi, japa, in Tibet. Kava, lungthi, japa. Mona, wangkar, japa. And khandro,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.960
 tej, japa. Those are in Tibet, and I'm translating this kava, lungthi, japa. Appointment and

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:08.160
 prediction lineages. And the second lineage is, and empowerment and aspiration lineages.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:17.200
 And third is, dakini, dakini-handed lineages. That's what I've translated. I'm translating that.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:24.000
 So that's what it means, this. This Thema teachings, generally all those great thetums came,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.360
 one after another, throughout the centuries, from maybe beginning of the, beginning of the

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:37.200
 10th century, or not 10th, me, I don't, 10th century, until now. They all are blessed by the

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:44.000
 GURUP and my sambhava, sambhava, and the Western dakini-shim soldiers. Either ancient time,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.200
 in the 8th century, or now, when they revealed, I guess before that, can be, can be.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.920
 And that means, that means now, therefore, then when those individuals, those great thetums,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:11.280
 those who revealed are known as thetums, they are designated, appointed by the GURUP and my sambh

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:11.600
ava,

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.800
 and the Western dakini-shim soldier, and they're going to reveal the teachings.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:25.280
 They're teaching us other treasures to benefit others. And the same time, they give predictions,

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.760
 means instructions, how you're going to do, what the time you do, and all those. Those are known as

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:39.200
 kabap lungti jupa, I translated appointment and empowerment something, or

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.480
 prophetic lineages. And the third one is, once that happened, and then third one is,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:57.200
 when GURUP and my sambhava, Western dakini-shim soldier, and as well as their those great thetums,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:04.320
 themselves, all put together intentions, their aspirations, together, they're going to reveal.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.000
 And GURUP and my sambhava shim soldier, they are, say this, may this happen. They do the pray,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.160
 kind of like sealing up more comfort, reaffirming with the power of the mind, to that individual,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:25.440
 same time to that individual, those thetums, also reconnecting their devotions and their connection

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.960
 to GURUP and my sambhava shim soldiers. So that's, that is then received empowerment, whatever they

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:32.960
're

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.760
 going to reveal, reveal the teachings, receive empowerment in the teachings. So third one, once

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:47.060
 that happened, and then dakini-handed lineages, and then lineage, those teachings are then handed

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.840
 by

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:55.360
 by ishim soldier, sambhava shim soldier, to those thetums, and handed or indicated, they will do,

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:02.480
 they will support to reward those. So those are three extra lineages, all those lineage masters,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:11.760
 ah, ah, right above the GURUP and my sambhava. And the right side of the GURUP and my sambhava,

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.280
 then is in the teaching said, and the Buddha shaktya manimis, and all the buddhas of the

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.440
 one thousand buddhas and buddhas of the three times, all are there. And the left side of the

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:31.280
 GURUP and my sambhava is, such as the GURUP and bodhisattvas, and all the ahatas and everything,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:38.090
 all that. In front of that, then, the GURUP and my sambhava, in front of that, GURUP and my sambh

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:38.320
ava

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:44.880
 is then all the deities, such as the Vedic liars, surrounded by with hai and giva, yamintaka, and

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:55.120
 adhirukas, and as well as dharmas, or as well as all the dharma palas, so that. I mean this all the

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:01.120
 field, and the right side of the GURUP and my sambhava, all the books and teachings that in

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:07.460
 the form of the rainbow lights. And then there was all, all I mean, every deities and all those bud

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:07.760
dhas

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:14.000
 and gurudev and dakini, all massive, right in front of you, and then do the prayer practices,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.160
 meditate. All of you can feel, it's too much that, and then we, we mean all that we can be

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.040
 summarized

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:27.920
 in one single state as GURUP and my sambhava. GURUP and my sambhava embody everything. All the

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.990
 buddhas, dharmas, dharmas, dharmas, gurudev, and dakini, those are known as, what, in a way they

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.200
 said,

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:41.840
 kundi nauru love, which means the wish, the system of the wish-fulfilling jewel that granted all

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.080
 the

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.480
 wishes. So GURUP and my sambhava is like that, in terms of the words, and then you

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.600
 then do the giant thing, prayers and receiving blessings as you receive instructions,

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:02.320
 the disease. And finally, then GURUP and my sambhava, all the linear master dissolve

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:09.680
 at the end after receiving blessings and emerge to your own mind and the nature of the mind.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:17.280
 And then our own mind is embodiment of all those, what we discuss already, daily,

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:25.120
 nature of the mind, everything. Then relax, meditate, meditate in the dhakti status,

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:33.280
 or meditate whatever you meditate. So meditation is nothing but relaxing your mind in the natural

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:44.080
 status, not in the past, not in the future. Write on the Persian status. That is what meditation,

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:56.240
 be in the present, persons is natural status. Past and the futures are in conceptions.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:04.400
 Present is fresh, naked state, according to teaching, relaxing that status.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:14.160
 Then if you like to do more practices, if you have time, then follow this. This is what he said.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:22.880
 Now, here is it. This is all from this. In the development stages, meditation,

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.760
 all appearance can be empty in the moon and reflections. And then all the repetition and

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:38.080
 otherness as sound emptiness of the mantras. And so now is the Vedayana teachings, now continually.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:45.200
 And Vedayana teaching can be divided, not can be, is divided into true group practices.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:54.320
 Those are, you all know, visualization and dissolving stages. Those are different,

00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:01.360
 kind of more simple names. All in the teaching said creation stages and completion stages.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.440
 So if I use both those terminologies, the creation stage of the visualization,

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.760
 completion stage of the dissolving, these are the two stage practices.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:22.080
 And the Vedayana teaching, all the teachings of Vedayana are encompassed in these two stages.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.680
 After you did the guru yoga or meditation on the guru practices, now you begin to engage him.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:39.520
 Engaging of the more, kind of more strongly practices in the Vedayana practices.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.720
 So this Vedayana practicing is known as true. I mean, you all know,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.040
 is I'm not talking something new. But this practice of the two practices,

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:57.200
 also another way if I say, there is three practices, three practices.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:07.360
 That is known as three Vedara. Vedara form practices, Vedara sound practices,

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:17.120
 Vedara mind practices. These three Vedara is actually the entirely universe, as I said

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.600
 earlier, and you know already, you of course, you received so many teachings from many great

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:29.280
 master's. So you know, it's already in this status. This is originally already that status.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:36.000
 To activate that, now we're doing these three Vedas, these three practices.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.520
 That three Vedas is already pure in this state as we discussed earlier. Everything is pure.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:51.680
 Everything is in light status. But we don't see that now. Now, why we don't see

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:59.040
 due to the habit patterns or due to the cataracts of our habit patterns we don't see.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.040
 In order to see that, to break through their cataracts,

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.480
 then a great teacher, Bodhacharya Muni gave this skill of means of teachings.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.640
 Skill of means of teaching which is known as visualization or creative stages.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.920
 Incidentally, we are visualizing everything in lightness status.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:31.440
 That instantly, what we are visualizing, even though this moment looks like we are imagining,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:41.120
 we're making up things. But according to Buddha teaching, even though it looks like making up,

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:46.640
 but it is lined up with the true nature, truth as it is.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:58.240
 Truth is pure. Truth is enlightened. We don't see that as if we just spoke so many times.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:09.680
 But this time, forcefully, we are activating that pureed status, pureed status,

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:16.960
 three visual states. How that started? From our mind.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:27.120
 From our mind. When we see actually things, when we tell that, "Oh, I see.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:34.480
 I heard. I know." Who is saying that? Nothing else besides the mind.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:41.520
 Mind is making everything. It's true. Mind is, according to Buddhism,

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:50.400
 already in Buddhism, or the majority of Buddhism, it is, mind is a cradle of every hour environment

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.400
.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:03.840
 And now, we are activating where things are, by the teaching of the Buddha, where things are.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:13.360
 So we visualize. What we visualize? Subject is pure, object is pure, and orbit when that is all

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:13.680
 pure.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:22.320
 What means pure? I maybe use word, maybe should use word, enlightened. Subject is enlightened,

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.840
 object is enlightened, and the beat of whatever it is, is all enlightened.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:38.400
 That in light is never changed. And never changed will not change, will not going to change.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.840
 To order to refer that, that knowledge in the Buddha's teaching known as vajra.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.680
 Vajra means Sanskrit word, but what means that it will be translated into English, as you all know.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:01.440
 Diamond. According to the conception of the world, diamond never going to change.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:11.520
 Diamond will be diamond. That is what says. The nature is not going to change. Even our

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:19.600
 conception is diluted and changing wrongly that, but now, nature never changed. The purity never

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:26.240
 changed. So therefore, it's called vajras. Now, to bring up the realization of the vajra,

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:33.970
 vajra of the poems, all these forms are enlightened state, for that reason is known as

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:35.040
 visualization.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:42.880
 Here, said all these forms are in like development stages, meditate, all the appearance are

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.760
 emptiness,

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:52.720
 moon, and the reflections. It's all enlightened. All enlightened as enlightenment, emptiness.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:54:00.400
 Everything is enlightened as reflection in the moon and the water. That in the Buddha teaching,

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:07.600
 for example, in the sutra teaching, Buddha give that those teachings. Form is emptiness,

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:15.280
 emptiness form. Now, in vajra and the teaching, that same thing, but it's enlightened.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:24.560
 Enlightened form, it is emptiness. What is enlightened? Those in all those inner centers,

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:33.520
 such as Gautengarbha centers, poems are the Buddha Vero Chanas. All five areas of the world,

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:42.240
 five aggregates are the five dhyana buddhas, five aggregates, five dhyana buddhas. This is not just

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:51.360
 making our joking, joking. According to Buddha's teaching in it, then it is all enlightened.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:55:00.320
 So now, this visualization is to bring up that way things are. That is the correction stage

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:09.280
 of the, what this, this moment we need correction because due to our habit dependence,

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:17.010
 we don't see what forcefully we're waking up. And that starts from our mind. Our mind is also empty

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:17.120
,

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:27.120
 yet it's pure. That reflector began to see the old and natural. But many times in the teaching,

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:34.160
 often said, Buddha nature. Now, Buddha nature is not just a Buddha nature. Buddha nature is

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:43.680
 waking up, exaggerating things up. So that's it. And then this visualization is in the,

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:51.200
 you all know, it started with three samadhis, three samadhis. Those are just listed in the book,

00:55:51.200 --> 00:56:01.120
 you all know. Satyana samadhi, manifestation samadhi and seed samadhis. Or samadhi is a Sanskrit

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:01.360
 word

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:11.440
 or the meditation. Satyana's meditation, all arising meditation and seed meditation. Through that,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:18.880
 developing all these visualizations. And then we see everything. Then

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:27.120
 all this sadness we follow. Then the teachings you follow. That is what sadness. The next one is,

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:35.360
 is the meditation on the utterance of the sound emptiness of mantras. Then second is,

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:43.460
 not just only the forms are enlightened. The sound is enlightened. What in the world we have

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:43.840
 actually

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:51.760
 now, according to the Buddhism or Buddhism. Poem, sound, mind and space. That's it.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:57:05.040
 There's nothing else besides. Poem, F-O-R-M, I think. Poems, sound, mind and space.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:13.120
 That's it. So all this is enlightened. All three is enlightened. That is what the

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:21.200
 enlightened state is, the Vedic energy known, three Vedic states. And they mean the unchangeable

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:29.600
 enlightened. They're not going to change. It's enlightened. So sound is enlightened.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.280
 So that is what to see this. And to do these practices and then to start that enlightenment

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.040
 sound of the enlightenment. Then in Vedic energy, give a lot of instructions on how to recite in

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:52.560
 the mantras. Mantras. That mantra, what we recite in mantra is not just only that. That sound is

00:57:52.560 --> 00:58:01.760
 as a ripple is reflecting to the all the sounds of the world and is reflecting to the all the wind

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:11.200
 of the world. The all blended in perfectly and become the voice sound of enlightenment.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:17.600
 What that sound of enlightenment may be is sound of loving kindness, compassion,

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:26.400
 wisdoms, blended in that all in the appearing of the song. It's all enlightened. All in that status

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:26.400
.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:34.320
 That sound is also as nature is, is, is emptiness and the appearance,

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:42.800
 emptiness. As in here, teaching says this, all sound emptiness. Everything is empty. There's

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:50.960
 no substantial solid existing. It's transforming, changing, merging. So that is regular mind,

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:59.280
 regular, regular sound systems. Then next one is then explaining all this. What's the mind or the

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.840
 regular mind? All the way through this next one, until the end of this is all teaching. And when

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:14.320
 you see a used word, it's all jokti teachings. All this is jokti teachings or is the teachings

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:21.680
 of the meditation. So that today I will stop here and then next week I'm going to go over this.

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:29.760
 Briefly, I'm going to conclude of this, this hard advised teachings, teachings. Many of you all

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:35.920
 resist instructions of the, of the jokki or many, you all resist the teachings of the meditation.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:43.280
 So therefore, but it is again, we go through this and through that. So now what we discuss,

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:49.760

 Saturday,

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.400
 3.30, I'm going to take away our two wonderful lamas teaching on the Kundal. So I will take

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.440
 kind of away that and I will try to enter in that. But otherwise, our two wonderful lama, lama,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.080
 laya and a lama truck are really giving wonderful teachings and inspiring encourage to all of us

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.320
 by doing the Kundal practices. Even you complete the Kundal practices, it is so good to do again,

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:27.920
 to touch the best. Touch the best is always good or touch to our home status, is home, sweet home.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.400
 From there, we develop and we can do so. It's so wonderful participating of the Kundal practices.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:41.000
 And this short Kundal is also our Kundal practice is so short. Among all the Kundals, there's so

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.200
 many

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.720
 versions of the Kundals, but this is a really short one. Timely teaching of the his own Dunyo

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.840
 Rinpoche or his predecessor of the Dunyo. Dunyo is so special, so concise, it is so beautiful.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.800
 So thank you so much, everyone. Angatrachi Dhelas.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:40.480
 We have this booklet, open prayer booklet. And we do one stanza, one verse of the dedication

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:49.810
 prayer, which is page 32 in English. By this merit, may all obtain omniscience, may it defeat the

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:50.080
 enemy

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.680
 wrong doing. From the stormy words, the birth of all the ages sickness and death. From the ocean,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.160
 the samsara, may I free all beings.
