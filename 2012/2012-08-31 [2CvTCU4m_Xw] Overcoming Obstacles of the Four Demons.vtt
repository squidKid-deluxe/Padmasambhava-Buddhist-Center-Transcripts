00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 "Again, I just will continue teaching and the listening of, again, both each other,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.400
 both each other and building motivations. And that will be the understanding of those

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 building motivations. Then, again, we reflect continually on the teachings. I just want also

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.480
 victims to talk about the relativity, really, the path Madhya-Mukha or union of two accommodations,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.440
 which is free from the exaggeration and the deprecations. Pretty much, I can't remember,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:52.000
 mention, very condensed, essential ways. And when we are advancing and taking journey in the path

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.240
 of

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:02.000
 enlightenment, there is not always a smooth ride, and not always smooth, and everything goes very,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 what's called, lala. Everything goes in lala, and you are right in fantasy island, and every day is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 fantasies, fantasies, fantasies. Definitely not going to exile. We are dealing with the realistic

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.240
 world. From this realistic world, we are going to discover the realistic nature of our building.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:37.200
 Therefore, we have a lot of different visions and the sceneries that we will see. It's always

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.160
 a one scenery all the time. This scenery is a lot of up and down domes, and the different sceneries

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.160
,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:59.840
 all that scenic moves that we see, is known as obstacles. It can enter lock, or it block our path.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 It could block, or it can deviate our journey, destinations. Or it will slow down. It will

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.640
 make something. But what we need to do is then continue the same intention as we start the day

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:31.040
 one, joy, appreciation, courage, commitment, let it come, and let it go. And we should have that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:40.640
 attitude all the time. With devotion, bodhicitta, poor renunciation, attitudes, those all we need.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.320
 To overcome until the scenery becomes so smooth. Whatever the scenery is, scenic move. It's a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.120
 scenic

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.680
 move, scenic move. Therefore, we're not going to change our course by the scenic moves.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.080
 We continue to keep. This scenic change, the scenic is what we're going to see,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:15.680
 is in Buddha teaching mentioned poor demons. Poor demons will show up. They are the cynics,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:26.880
 poor demons. First demon is the demon of aggregates, aggregate demons. Second demon

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:36.640
 is a demon of the emotions. And a third demon is known as demon of the destructions.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:55.200
 And a fourth demon is demon of the death. Those are known as poor demons.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.120
 Their metaphor is not just demon is coming, because devil is what we interpret as something bad. It

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.280
 will

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 devour or block our wishes. That's what we use the metaphor as demon. So here also Buddha used

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.400
 metaphor as demons. Demons. What is a demon of aggregates is all the hindrance that related with

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.920
 our aggregates. Aggregates, in particular physical aggregates, poem aggregates, particularly

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 related

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.640
 with poem aggregates. There's many different. This generally the demon is not something that

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 only the we, the who take the journey or put by the path, faces this. These poor obstacles or poor

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.320
 demon is generally, we all said it would be good too. It's nothing that extra way we are

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.040
 experiencing.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.800
 But however, we know in taking the journey practicing, practicing in the path, what it does,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:09.520
 it will block. It will make obstacle for us. So therefore, then it's blockage of our path

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.960
 and obstacles. And now of course the demon is demon of the aggregates. This is anything

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.240
 that we related simply related with physical things. And always this is something that

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.200
 it becomes the number one kind of concern and issues with us. Therefore, we have to take care

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:39.520
 of generally physical content, our past capabilities, really balanced way. Balanced way is the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.840
 teaching

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:48.880
 of the Buddha. Nice and balanced ways. Balanced ways, but then we should also not divert it

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:58.400
 and slow down or stop the practices. Stop the doing good things. We continually maintain our

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:09.600
 practice and our joy. That is what is known as the overcome the demons of aggregates.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.960
 Or in other words, also we shouldn't attach it too much to these physical things. We should take

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.960
 care of this, but not completely, can't involve all the time with this. We have to take care of

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.160
 this body. That's what the teaching said. We know this. Great Master Shanti Deva said, this is like

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.160
,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.000
 this body is like boat. Close the ocean or the river or the lake. It's like boat. Without this

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.240
 boat, we're not going to cross. We're not going to go far enough anywhere, any places. Therefore,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.400
 we have to take care of this boat. We can go and keep this body as like taking care of our

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.160
 boat. Boat and our wake up. That is what we're going to maintain and we have to have that

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.240
 attitude. And then with this and continue to carry the practice, continue to do the good things.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:18.880
 So that is really about the demon of the physicals or aggregates. The next one is demon of the

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:28.480
 emotions. The demon of the emotion is, is as emotion. Emotion, in this time particularly related

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.360
 with the rough emotions. Rough emotions. Many times when you are practicing meditating,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:43.360
 it kind of brings up the outer emotions in the teaching set. Because why is that? Because

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:55.520
 we are cleansing our habit patterns of that which is accumulated, fired up many lifetimes.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:04.000
 We're cleansing. We're purified. That means we're cleansing our chimneys. We're cleansing our

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.920
 chimneys. More than we're cleansing our separate systems. The separate system of our ears is not

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:23.440
 something that we had happened yesterday. This is something long-term collected things. We're

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.280
 cleansing. Where we're cleansing the chimney, where we're cleansing the separate systems,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:40.640
 you know what we go through. We know. We all know. You know I know. It's a smelly posture. Very

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.360
 smelly. And then plus there's more things. More things comes. But what that means,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:55.680
 it means we're cleansing. That is what it means. We're really cleaning. We're cleansing. We're

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:05.440
 purified. This smell of the separate system comes many ways. Comes up. This gas comes. And those

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:05.920
 are

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:13.680
 comes with very such as emotions. Very very kind of attachment. Attachment is burst up. Desire is

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:22.080
 bursting up. Coming up. And all is bring up the other things too. Up. But front runner become the

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.600
 attachment or the desire. Up front runner of that is become like anger. And then all the fire goes

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 up.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.120
 Up front runner will be the doubt and hesitations. Up front runner will be the arrogance.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.200
 Up front runner could be jealousness. But it's all combination of those. Could come. This is not

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.600
 just only again. One smelly. This there's five different doors. Different smelly combination.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:59.200
 All that comes up. Come that up. That will come up. That comes as I said. This means it's not that

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.560
 our practice is going in our own direction. It didn't mean our practice is something not working.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.080
 It means it's working. It's working. It's cleansing. It's purified. It's great. Therefore,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.560
 what we need to keep the same quality, same commitment, the same quality as we started day

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.640
 one. Joy. Appreciation. Both each other. Feel close connected to the Buddha and work with him or

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.800
 someone. All those in life. Feel their blessing. The power. And we combined that with both each

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.880
 other. With the both each other. And may all sentient beings never experience this. May I'm

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:43.200
 taking all this so that everyone becomes perfectly beautiful. Things come. All those tools the

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.280
 greatest teacher Buddha taught in the teaching. Teaching. Use that. Those means that that's the

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.840
 time we use the teaching. Applying not teaching is put on the carpet or somewhere in bookshops.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.800
 Bring up the teaching to use that. That is known as the practitioner's. That is known as the

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:11.440
 practitioner's. Therefore, we should, should take again courage and commitment. Let it come. Let it

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:19.120
 go. But destination, goal, strength and gauntlet and intention never damage it. And that is known

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:28.640
 as the non-returning apparatus. Approaching the non-returning gauntlets. We're making

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:39.680
 harder and stronger and beautiful. That is what it is. So that is really a border, the demon of the

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:51.920
 emotions. Now the demon of the destructions. This destruction demon is also emotional. But this

00:11:51.920 --> 00:12:00.080
 destruction gives very soft ways, gentle ways, something appearing. That's why it's called a

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:07.840
 distract. It's very deceitful. It's very deceitful. Deceitful because it looks so beautiful. So

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.160
 nice.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.440
 The first one, demon of the emotion is so rough, so strong. Immediately we will notice it.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:25.600
 Immediately notice it. But demon of the destruction is so appealing, so naive, so low key. It's

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:25.920
 like

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:35.600
 low undercurrents. Low undercurrents. But it will pull you deep down to the ocean. Even worse than

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:47.520
 demon of emotions. Demon of other demons. It is mostly powerful. Powerful. It comes with a

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:58.080
 sincerely pleasure object in a way. Beautiful tones in the eyes. Beautiful songs in the ears.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:06.320
 Beautiful smells to the nose. Beautiful smell, taste to the tongues. Beautiful soft tender touch

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.200
 to the bodies and appealing things to our mental state. Something nice and beautiful kind of looks

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:22.880
 bad. But it will be destructive with that. It will pull down as really more deeper than what

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:33.760
 those other demons. Therefore, it is known as demon of the destructors. They come with low keys.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:43.200
 Whenever that coming, always be alert. Always be balanced. And always be smart.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:52.080
 We are not going to let go too far. Even it looks like too beautiful. So nice and so spread.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.680
 But if it has become the hindrance, it's going to become the obstacle for our division, our goal,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.480
 our practice, that what we did there when we started it become. We have to keep the balance.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:14.320
 What do we call it? Enough is enough. We have to say enough is enough. That's it. We have to keep

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:22.320
 the balance, strength. That is known as warriors. Are we able to do this? That's all we call

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:30.640
 known as warriors. And that is known as satvas in Sanskrit language. Satvas, the warrior,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:39.360
 encourages ones for the enlightenment. Encourages ones, warriors for the encourages ones for

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:47.760
 to propel the good things to our own sake and the sake of all the beings. And truly, we keep that

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.240
 way.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:59.440
 We are truly approaching to the good directions. This all known as obstacles, demons. And then,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:06.480
 of course, demon of the dead. This is something last. Last comes but that everybody appears.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.320
 Beforehand the demon of the dead. This all kind of waiting on the path, along the road. So we

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:14.640
 should

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.320
 always be kind of thoughtful, mindful, applied, teaching and not forbidden. Applied with the

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:31.440
 mindfulness, with the alertness and with the consciousness with that. Then truly will become

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:40.240
 very beautiful practitioners. Humble, simple, strong and then very direct and become the

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:48.800
 as then you become the beacon of the world. Truly light of the world may bring the pure and peace,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:57.120
 happiness to all beings and as well as one's own self. So those are what known as something that

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.040
 always remember because this generally to everyone with practices sometimes those comes

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:11.520
 like strongly and sometimes low key and this okay those i summarize that but this is related

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.400
 all that different there is like the movement in the different each the business nothing big thing

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.680
 is just we have to keep this just all those are below wind below wind and we have to continue to

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.040
 keep that every kind of destroyed the blowing wind then we become so fragile nothing going to walk

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.200
 at

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.080
 all looks like we just get up and something else come knock down us on the ground something again

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.800
 we get up and something else come up knock down us and on the beach and we goes on and on for to

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:52.400
 avoid that always and the teaching said be strong courage and openness and let it come let it go

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.800
 that

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:59.680
 is very powerful teachings let it come let it go all the teachings that means we're not going to

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.360
 keep the resistance on this we're going to swing with this we're going to become the beautiful

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:15.600
 surfer surfer surfer as currents we use that currency to move we pasta pasta and stronger

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:24.480
 and further that is what's known as let us come let it go and open ourself then always there is

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:31.600
 sunshine the intelligence the wisdom that comes so those are important during our paths then with

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 this then we finally
