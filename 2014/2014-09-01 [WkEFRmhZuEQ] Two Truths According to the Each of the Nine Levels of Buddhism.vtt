00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760
 How it becomes deeper, wider, and more performant according to the Jnana levels. Jnana or the

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.760
 Drana levels. Now the first, how many doctrines? We have regularly said that there are poor

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:27.220
 doctrines. Poor doctrines generally what that means is Buddha gives the teachings, teachings,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:36.600
 and then after the Buddha entered Mahaparin Nirvana, now those masters began to establish

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.160
 the systems, the entire teaching of the Buddhas in a way to condense the brain up so that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 everybody can understand and follow that. Follow that. Follow the will, follow the meditation,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.480
 and follow the conduct, and then bear the results. So it is establishment of the systems, of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 the entire teaching of the Buddha, how these great masters interpreted and established.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.120
 That is what is called doctorance. In interpreting, doctoring is called Trungtha. Trungtha,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.360
 something

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.640
 that really is not also kind of vaguely established or put the system together, but it is through

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.240
 the teaching of the Buddha, through the reason, is long and a rabbi let it believe itself. Long

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 means, scripture means the teaching of the Buddha. Exhilarly follow with the teaching of the Buddha

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.280
,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 and they use the logic, reasoning, and it's now true. What Buddha said is true, and this is what

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.120
 it is. That's how they establish it. Buddha also gives that way teaching to it. He gives

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.800
 it his reason, and then Buddha gives the teachings with this. So therefore, these doctorance, these

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.400
 first four doctorates that we all started, and also we can keep additional objects. And of course,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.960
 many of you, a few of you, maybe don't do these things, but again, as I said, this doctrine is a

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.240
 system that Buddhism developed after the Buddha entered the Mahāprā in the months. And it is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 exactly teaching of the Buddha, because follow the scripture of the teaching of the Buddha,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.450
 and use the reason, added a reason, reason, this is what in all Buddha in the teaching over 45

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.480
 years,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 I think over 45 years. So they collected all that anger, anger everywhere, looked, and then could

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.200
 have talked with the reason. So that is a doctrine. Now, the doctrine has four doctors. That's the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 philosophical systems of the doctrine, four. And one of four, please tell me.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:08.680
 Vibhāṣka. Vibhāṣka. What? Vibhāṣka. Satyātrika. Middleweight, or mind only. Shri Mārta.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.280
 Middleweight, that middleweight, that's it. Right? Okay, now I'd like to ask, what means Vibhāṣ

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.520
ka?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:31.680
 Vibhāṣka means? Particular in school. Particular schools. Yeah, the school is sev, in the debate

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.680
,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.040
 it's called sev Rāṇava. Sev Rāṇava means is particularly expressive, particularly expressive.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.810
 But this sev Rāṇava is, actually, in the teaching said, I don't know if you can imagine those

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.920
 things

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.600
 in this first Vibhāṣka or Bhūgula, I don't remember that. But in what means Vibhāṣka,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:09.160
 it is named after very famous teaching called sev Rāṇava. Sev Rāṇava. This is pacifically

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.520
 expressed,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:19.000
 particularly pacifically, or the title of the pacific explanations. It's very famous text.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 This in the teaching said that in the Buddha gave, of course, Abhidharma teachings. But Buddha gave

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.960
,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.080
 Abhidharma teachings, in a way, very kind of like, just occasionally in the Buddha gave teaching,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.280
 there's no independently existing Abhidharma teaching, such as we learn Abhidharma. Dharma,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.880
 that Buddha gave as the Pandya Paramata or the Vinayas, is very spread out. And because of that,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.460
 then during the Buddha's time, seven ahatas collected all the teachings and put toghed,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:05.130
 put toghed. Troghed, that's known as seven groups of the Abhidharma teachings. These seven groups

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.520
 of

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.680
 Abhidharma teaching is the Buddha teaching, all at the time of the Buddha. And some said,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.200
 "Oh, it's not Buddha's city because it's aha, those great ahatas, in a way, collected." But

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.800
 however, the teaching of the Buddha collected by this great ahatas, such as Hari Putter and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.880
 Mongol Putter, and so forth, is the seven ahatas. And that is what Abhidharma teaching

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.720
 independently

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:42.330
 existed. And of course, Vaidyana teaching, such as Pandya Paramata teachings, also known as Abhidh

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.600
arma

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.520
 teaching, but this is the wisdom teaching, teachings on the wisdom. Abhidharma is the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.440
 wisdom. And wisdom has two wisdoms, starting wisdom, contemplation wisdom, or solitary,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.120
 and then meditation wisdoms. This Pandya Paramata teaching in Vaidyana teaching is more like

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 meditation and practice wisdoms. So starting at a contemplating level, more focused, is these

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.800
 seven groups of the Abhidharma teachings, gathered by these great seven ahatas. Then that

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.960
 continually, in accordance to his story, that continually until the Port Petriyas of the

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:30.520
 Buddhist Port, Port Petriyas. And that is, first of all, kashapa, post-Petriyas, or post-Buddha

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:40.640
 reading, kashapa, then ananda, then called shani kuji, and the master, ahat shani kuji,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:52.240
 so ahat, kashapa, ahat, ananda, ahat, shani kuji, in the Tibetan word, and then port one is ahat,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:01.040
 niebi, niebi, niebi, is then, if you use Sanskrit word, is apa-gubta, iti, apa-gubta. It's among

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.600
 all causes, all those, like, they are not really different than Buddha himself. Maha-kakah is ahat,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:15.080
 ananda is ahat, and shani kuji become ahat. Everyone is like golden molten, one after another. But

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:24.320
 among that, this niebi become the one in history, one of the great religions of the upper Buddhist,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:33.040
 because it gets, so many students came, students came, so many people gathered ananda groups by

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.160
 his teachings, and so many people told the ordination program. And the teachings here,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:45.520
 they give so many teachings. Each time they collected one stone, sorry, stick, stick, stick,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.240
 and they just put it inside one cave. I think this can loosely indicate in the other, Ayodhya,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:08:03.560
 Ayodhya, around that place. In the modern time, Ayodhya is ancient time name too. So the whole cave

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.920
 is filled by that small stretch, because the number of the howl, he give the ordination is there.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.200
 So this is the one of the very famous ahatas and badriyas. In that time, in the teachings,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:30.780
 they said, 500 ahatas gathered together and met the commentaries, commentaries on that seven groups

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.000
 of

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.680
 Abhidharma teachings, seven groups of Abhidharma teachings. And that's what they did. And that is

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.870
 the first accorded Buddhism, first commentaries on the Buddha teachings. Five hundred ahatas

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.400
 gathered

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:55.360
 together and met commentaries on this. This is called, then, sevra-hindu-chimu, as I said before,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:04.840
 the trigger of the Pacificic explaining, sevra-hindu-chimu. So, Vibhashika school,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:16.340
 follow that teaching, that teaching and then named after that teaching, then Vibhashika. And

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.600
 because

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:22.320
 also in the teachings said, Vibhashika's master, as they said, is immediately to understand the

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.640
 teaching of the Buddha himself directly, it's difficult. We should follow the commentaries,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.400
 commentaries, we should follow that. So, they follow with that teaching and the school name,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:44.640
 Vibhashika. So, that is Vibhashika's. Then, this has how many, the trigger of the expressing the

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:55.520
 Pacific, or particularly, that has in the teachings said, 100,000 standards, is not completely

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:03.440
 translated into Tibet. There are many volumes, it says, it's not translated completely. But that

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:12.960
 is so big, and it's so vast, again, even though it is. And then, great master Basubendu extracted

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.880
 essence of that, that, and known as that, this modern time, everybody knows, Abhidharma-kautam,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:27.160
 Abhidharma-kautam, which is, again, so profound and deep, but to compare it with this 100,000

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:34.440
 standards of that express, trigger of the express of the particular or Pacific things, it's then

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:43.520
 smaller. Smaller, and also this then become, then, the powerful, famous, Abhidharma teachings.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.600
 Basubendu was always also named as second Buddha. Second Buddha, he like, has become as like second

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:57.880
 Buddha. And so famous, so master, so scholar, scholar, so understanding, and he memorized,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:09.200
 he tried, and he said, 900, so in '89, '99, so there is, that he memorized completely, and he

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.800
 joined that once in a year, or once in a month, every year. He sat there, during the night, in the

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:23.990
 teaching, he said, he sat on the big olive oil, not the olive oil, sorry, because olive oil becomes

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.160
 so

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:30.320
 popular now, so I'm using that, he means olive oil. But he said, it's a mustard oil, this is big

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:39.120
 mustard oil, chain, and it's up to here, here, and then he joined, decided all that

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:47.520
 sutras. Why he said in the day, you see, because it takes so much energy, so much energy, therefore

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:55.600
 oil absorbs, re-energizes that. That's what he said. So this great master synthesized. So that,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.720
 therefore, this vivashika, it's the name, that, upper name there. And then, suttantika, what is

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:16.200
 the meaning of suttantika, now? Suttar meaning? Computer school class. That's it? That's what

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.910
 teaching says. And there's what, the suttantika school said, oh, all the way to the commentaries of

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.000
 the

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.360
 Buddha teaching, still Kupa can buy some mistakes. Therefore, we're going to follow this with the

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:35.900
 teller to the suttara, do that teaching itself. Therefore, then is the name as suttara, suttantakas

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.040
,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:45.060
 suttantakas. And then, next school is what? I think we said mind-only school. Why is the name mind-

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.480
only?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:57.390
 Because mind exists. What? Mind exists. Yeah, that's it. This is from now on, from now on these

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:57.720
 schools,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.000
 all the way to the very end, everything is disability of mind. But this started from here.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.240
 Here, therefore, he said everything is mind. Everything is disability. That also indicating,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:23.480
 before that, that means vivashika and suttantaka don't accept everything's mind. They don't accept.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:32.280
 Their philosophy, their doctrine, don't accept everything's mind. But from mind-only school,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:41.630
 everything is now mind. So mind-only school, then said mind-only. That means mind-only. Everything

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:41.800
 is

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:49.950
 mind-only. That's it. And then, next one is Mademaka. And what is meaning of Mademaka? Bold meaning

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.440
 of Mademaka.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:59.800
 What? That's it. And what that means, middle-way means? Free of extremes. What? Free of extremes.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:08.680
 That's it. Free from the extremes. Because Mademaka is similar. Everything is disability

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.320
 of mind. All that did not highlight that. But everything is, nature is not extreme. That's

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:22.520
 indicating. Nature is not indicating. Things we see in the world, whatever that may be,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:30.840
 it is also where a building is balanced. It's balanced. Middle-way means balanced.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:41.000
 Balanced. That is what it is. All and no extremes. Free from the extremes. That. And then,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.320
 that is external. It's relativized. At the absolute level, even there is no middle.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.240
 Middle. And what that great master now originally said in the teachings?

00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:05.240
 Said. Said. Since there is no extreme or an edge, how there is middle? Middle. There is no middle.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:15.240
 Middle. And again, so that means every grasping notion has to be released to discover the true

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:23.000
 as it is. True as it is. As we start holding something, we are following the Force.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:35.240
 Force. F-A-L-S-E. Force. All the illusions. Illusions. And then that will deceive, deceive.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:47.080
 That will make us disappointments. So that's about the world meanings of this Force Force. Now you

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:55.160
 know. So now I think we really met this meaning of the Force Force there. Now we go back to the

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.560
 head.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.880
 Said. How they developed the true truth. Or how, how they interpreted two truths.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:09.880
 So that means all the schools were Buddhism. Except bring the true truth. Because the teaching

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:19.640
 of the Buddha is natural. And how Vibhachika schools now going to see the true truth.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:31.480
 And that is what in the teaching said. Said. And that is again famous quotation from Abhidharma

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:41.960
 Gautam. That by great Master Vasubenus. And that he said. Things can destroy. Things go away.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:49.640
 Way. And all, anything of things can go away. Things are going to be destroyed.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:57.880
 All the clinicians and this ability. Those all are related truth. Things go away.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:08.200
 But something that cannot go away. Go away is absolute truth.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:17.640
 That is what this great Master Vasubenus said. And that is the view of the Vibhachika schools.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:25.720
 Of true truth. Now what that means. Things can go away. And that is for example used

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:37.640
 examples in the teaching. Was. Was. V-A-S-E. Was. Was. If somebody came and hit the counter.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:44.200
 It can be destroyed. You lost that was. Was.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:51.000
 And then also something said to look into the river.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:00.440
 What you're looking to the river. First minute. And next minute that river is gone.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.560
 It's not the same. Same river. Or same water. Same water is gone.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.440
 So this is the changing. Changeable these things.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:19.800
 All that. And then there was, for example used was. If it was that we bring down that.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.800
 Down that and break was. And then again humming. Hummering. Hummering. Hummering. Hummering.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:35.640
 Eighty it will go to this. This pieces go away. Completely go away. Pieces go away. Pieces go away.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.720
 Completely. Getting smaller. Smaller. Smaller.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.160
 This is the examples of every these gross things.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:58.120
 Is. Is. Illusions. Can be destroyed. Can be destroyed. Can be changed.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:06.680
 But then what is the absolute truth? Something that cannot be destroyed.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:17.690
 Cannot be destroyed. That is what this school says, I mean in the teaching said, said that the

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.680
 atoms,

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:29.000
 atom, the molecule or the subatomic whatever terminology is the most subtle sub particles.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:41.880
 Sub particles. That is existing. And that is the sub particle. Sub particle level that is

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.520
 thick. The most subtle subtle particle. That is existing and that cannot be destroyed.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:55.560
 Cannot be destroyed. If you burn away, they use the examples. If you burn that in fire,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:03.560
 fire cannot burn. There is nothing to burn. And if you throw that in the river,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:14.120
 there is nothing to carry away. Not just that, even the others. Such as Hari Potara, Mughal Potara,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:23.320
 they didn't find anything. So this is partless atoms. So partless atoms.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:35.480
 And then that is the. So this is one. And the second is the partless of our mind,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.040
 partless of our consciousness. Again, our consciousness, personally our consciousness

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.800
 gross is something that we can feel, we can take that. But if we divide that by the times,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:59.800
 past is past or past and the future is not yet erupt. And present consciousness, we divide that

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:10.360
 in mentally, divide it to the times. Times, then also there is nothing to find. It's gone.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:23.080
 And but that partless consciousness is existing. That is existence. And then they put a reputation

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:31.240
 or ask questions. Absent there is nothing to find. It cannot be burned, cannot be carried by in the

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:38.280
 rivers or whatever. And even the others didn't see. Then why is there? Why? Then what is this,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:47.480
 what you mean is there? Then they ask us because they have to have that. Otherwise this is what we

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:58.360
 see. This universe and everything, where that comes from? Where this comes from? Then it won't

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:05.720
 function. Our mind cannot function. So therefore, even we did it, it detected, even we didn't see.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:14.280
 But there is existing known as that partless atom. Partless. It has no part at all. It's the

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:29.240
 most subtle sub, sub-atomic, sub-atomic. No, indivisible particle. Yeah, there's beyond that.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:38.520
 It's that, that's so. That is the, the substantial existing and that is absolute truth.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:47.480
 These two partless atoms, partless atom and partless consciousness is absolute truth.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:57.160
 Absolute truth. So that is the one, these two, these goals. Agnes of the,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:25.800
 the true truth or they, they perceive this. And now we move to the, to the second,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:34.520
 something that can, can perform the action and something that can do is related truth.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:48.520
 And something, somebody cannot function that is. Sorry, I, I mixed up, I mixed up.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.480
 Something that can perform the activities and functioning, that is absolute truth.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:01.000
 That is absolute truth. And something that cannot perform, perform the action as we see,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.920
 and that is related to this. So that means it can, as something that, the object that can,

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:17.080
 something that can do, functioning that is absolute truth and cannot do, then related,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.280
 related to truth. So that example now, what that is, is, for example, something that can

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:33.640
 function things means that a fire can burn and heat up. It is. That is, and water can wash,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:40.200
 cleanse, or put in the garden, so forth. And similarly, was can carry the water,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:50.840
 was can carry the water, so forth. Those all are absolute truths. Truths. And the related truth is

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:59.800
 that, artificial, if we use artificial, artificial, or such as picture of the was

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:09.480
 cannot carry water, even though it looks like was, was, or the reflection moon in the water

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:18.760
 is not the moon. It won't perform as function activity as, as moon. And then,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:24.840
 rapid homes, if you use those, rapid homes, of course, conceptual levels, all these things,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:35.080
 that those are all known as relative truths. So there's slightly different ways to interpret

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:43.800
 this two truths. And now, we move to the mind-only schools. How the mind-only schools

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:55.320
 develop. All they say, the relative truth and absolute truths. And generally, in mind-only

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:04.440
 schools, their personal philosophy is what? What are those called? Three something. Anybody knows?

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:04.840
 Three what?

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:12.200
 Three natures. Anybody? Three natures?

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:25.080
 That's it. Three natures. Three natures, or if I use it in a slightly different way,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:32.600
 translation. Three characteristics. Three characteristics. This is the principle

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:41.880
 philosophies of, in a way, way, not in a way, principle philosophies of the mind-only schools.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:48.760
 Three characteristics. And these three characteristics are, many times I translate it,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:57.480
 I think, with the kiramuji, the exaggeration of the power and true existence. But I was also

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.000
 so surprised to put this, maybe this is more nicer than what I did, I thought. And this is,

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:16.680
 in post-excavation, they use input phenomena. Input phenomena. Input phenomena or input

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:27.240
 labels. Input phenomena. And input, I think, is A-N-P-U-T. Or A-M. I-M. I-M.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:38.600
 Imputed. Inputty. Inputty phenomena. It's that what I open you to say, exaggeration.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:49.320
 So you compare. You compare which is good. Exaggeration or that. And then, this other powers,

00:27:51.240 --> 00:28:01.960
 again, I use that and then some other, also I saw. So, and use the word, that dependent phenomena.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:12.680
 Dependent phenomena. Dependent phenomena. And then, this yundap, true existence.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:24.520
 That is, as I think, the ultimate existence. So now, we think of these three meanings.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:32.920
 Three. And what is now, maybe we go with the ultimate existence. Ultimate existence

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:49.080
 is in this school. Mind-only school. Accepting there is that mind truly exists. Truly exists.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:55.560
 And alternate teachings say, existing where they exist and not just exist as we say,

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:05.160
 but existing beyond of the grasping of subject and object. The mind, that means,

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:16.840
 mind that true mind, clear like awareness, which is free from clinging of the subject and object.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:30.520
 Object, that mind exists. That mind exists. So that mind is here. Name known as true existing.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:39.880
 Or intubated yundap, yundap. True existing is there, is here. Because of that,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:49.880
 then all this displays arise. Everything is came to us. Each individual, that is the same.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.120
 In the Jyotji teaching, in the Vajrayala teaching, same. Each individual is, in a way, our own

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:04.200
 creation of our own environments. Each individual are the creators of our perception,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.240
 perception, consumption, and then of course consciousness and as well as feelings.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:19.560
 In a way, we finally, everything say, okay, the ourself. We would say, it's consciousness,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:31.470
 it's mind. Everything is mind. So now that is what's called, this is truly existing or yundap, yund

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.640
ap.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:47.480
 This true existing, existing, then this dependent phenomena or power by others, other powers.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:56.840
 Other powers, that is because this, this sub, this, this mind that which is free from the

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:05.720
 subject object of grasping, cling on the subject object, that is not just one piece of object,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:14.120
 but it is as all the qualities of the variety and openness, flexibles, possibilities,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:25.640
 effects, all that possibilities. From that, from that, spontaneously arising the energy, arising

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:34.440
 qualities. That arising qualities is known as interdependent co-ordination. It's all connected,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:44.920
 that kind of waves as like connections, connections of the interdependence. As like almost like cow

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:54.920
 waves, cow waves, cow waves, cow waves, cow waves, cow waves. But it's not just straight forward

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.080
 like

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.960
 that. Our target is they all connected, yet of course it dissolves, is emerging, reappearing that

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.640
 interdependent co-ordination. It's not just one, straight lines, cow waves, cow waves, like that.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:17.320
 But it's all cooperated, cooperated. That cooperated is known as the power of the others

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:25.320
 or the dependent phenomena. It's not just they arise this by one, one by one,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:36.440
 it's all arising. It's dependent, dependent. And then what are those arises? We go to all these

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:45.880
 phenomena things, I arise one after another, as I said, all the arrogance, all the perceptions.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:55.880
 Then our dream begins, dream begins, tangibly. And then that also merging, unfolding one after

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.920
 another, another, and then whole, that dream begins. So that is known as other powers,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:12.680
 other power. Because of that, because of that, then we make exaggerations, as I said,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:20.920
 I translate exaggerations, but other place I saw input phenomena. Then we put the input phenomena.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:28.680
 To that phenomena, we make inputs, inputs. What do we input? Then we make all the divisions,

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:38.040
 what is the rest? Good, bad, dirty, clean, high, low, and right, wrong, all the mountain tree,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:49.880
 water, so for this all we input. We input it, we hold onto that as we input this. They not,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:58.360
 that also indicated that other power is not really coming with that names, these labels,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:10.760
 it's not coming, but we label, we put that, we made up that, everything. And then each country

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:18.360
 made different names, these and that things, but it is all inputs. That is known as exaggeration

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:29.800
 or input phenomena. This is how the samsara then begins. So now the reality level is what?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:38.040
 Is the true existence? The consciousness or the consciousness is free from the two

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:52.040
 grasping, subject and object. That clay sub-luminate, sub-intelligence is known as the

00:34:52.040 --> 00:35:02.040
 absolute truth. That is the absolute truth in this school. And other powers or dependent powers and

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.360
 as

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:15.880
 well as, as input phenomena, all are relative truths. All are relative truths. Input phenomena,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:25.880
 other power, that is relative truths. Then of course, and again in the great Master Mahoney

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:35.320
 Buddha, this used very clay precisely and in this teaching said that, but also this other power

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:44.920
 can have actually two, two aspects. And other power of the indeed build other powers and build

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:53.320
 other powers. And that I think I'm going to talk with you with these truths, but if we use that

00:35:53.320 --> 00:36:03.240
 glance now here, that impure other powers is all this, our, what we're discussing now, all these

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:14.920
 things is impure. And then with the levels, all is, is, is impure other powers. The pure other

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.960
 powers

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:25.000
 is then, the pure lands. Pure land and the wisdom, guides and all those in Buddha's environment or

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.040
 enlightenment environment is pure other powers. That to compare with the kind of language things

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.680
 are,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:44.200
 then other, that, that will build, build other power phenomena is, is absolute truth. It's truth.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:54.040
 That is what it is. That not going to deceive us. That this impure of the phenomena or the power,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:01.720
 this thing, it is, it's going to deceive us. It's going to change. It's not going to last.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:12.760
 But that pure phenomena, pure and dependent phenomena or other power which you would

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.520
 ask me, we use and that we're going to stay. This is the environment of the pure lands.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:29.080
 So that is the really understanding of this,

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:44.040
 this mindful resource, the heritage truth explained. So that means again, if I put a

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.440
 really, really kind of truth without using, using those three, three characteristics,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:59.400
 then I will say in this school, school, the relative truth is the, all the grasping and clinging

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:08.520
 subject, objects are the relative truths and the nature, that or nature of the mind, which is free

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:16.840
 from the true grasping of the subject or object, that is absolute truth. That is absolute truth.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:25.960
 So grasping, clinging, holding, this is relative truth, free from that, that of the consciousness

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:33.800
 is absolute truth. That is the one, how these schools excel. And now I won't talk over, the

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:40.840
 Madhivaka is already here, here, so we go over to the next. And now how the Vadiyana teachings,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:49.320
 how that explores these two truths. And first of all, the Vadiyana is now again, really mind-only

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.160
 schools, exactly these external achievements. Same way, and the Madhivaka is the same. Same. Now

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:55.560
 they

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:03.400
 just more glorify, more redefine that, more widening, more deepening that. And absolute truth,

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:11.640
 truth and the relative truths, again. And I said yesterday, really to you, all the visualizations

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:18.280
 of the creative stage is the relative truths. And the dissolved stage of the compilation is

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.720
 absolute truth. That is the one, just generally understanding that. But if we go pacifically to

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:33.480
 this, then for example, Kriya Tantra, explaining again, the absolute nature is the same as

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:41.960
 Madhivaka. Madhivaka, free from all the conceptions. That is absolute status.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:51.400
 And the relative level, everything is purely status. Relative level, everything purely status

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:57.960
 as three Buddhas. And highlight the three Buddhas, which is, is what?

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:12.260
 That's it. That's the relief. That's it. Kriya Tantra, what means Kriya Tantra? Actually, Kriya Y

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.760
ana.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:26.920
 What? What is it? Action. Yeah, action. Kriya is this Sanskrit word used as action.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:33.480
 And why they named it Kriya Tantra? And the teaching said, that's what we learned. We learned,

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:39.560
 all of us taught it, we learned those things. And the teaching said, said because this school also

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:46.440
 emphasized a lot of external activities, emphasized a lot of external activities.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:54.680
 And to cleansing, to purifying ourselves in the environment, a lot of emphasize

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:03.080
 on the activities, outer activities. And those are there. And the principal said that at least

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:10.760
 take a shower, three times take showers, and three times change your clothes in the day times,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:18.200
 or I mean, 24 hours, like that, at least three times. Those external, those are also different

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:25.640
 meanings, addition of these levels, maybe more code or thing. But this is the one, teaching said

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.280
 that.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:33.880
 So this is all with those characteristics. And see, then absolute is free from every extremes.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.720
 And every extremes means, there is what, how many extremes in the Buddha teaching said?

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:47.720
 Said, what are? Poor. Poor. What are those? Existing, non-existing, neither nor. That's true.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:53.720
 That's it. That's the most time said, existing, non-existing, not existing, neither and neither is

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.360
 that.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:01.000
 So that is the teaching said that. And so that is a very popular. And so this free from that,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:08.360
 that means there's no any sport of the grasping and clinkings. Clink everything in fundamental

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:15.800
 level and as well as natural level is open, totally open, totally free from serious. And that is

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:24.280
 absolute natures. And then in the relative level, and these three various, three these

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:30.040
 buddha states, teaching said, and brilliantly with this, in the teaching said, all those kind of

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.280
 like,

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:43.080
 gross things what you see, is the energy of the geniuses, outlaw, good shortness, gross things.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.920
 And all the soft and tender things, what do you see, is like when you see this. And all the rough

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:55.400
 and gross kind of like the tongues, what you see is the energy of the very body. Those are also in

00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:01.400
 the teaching. So that means all is within that nadana state. And then in the absolute level,

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.680
 on the reality level, both are inseparable. They're not separated. This is the same

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:14.590
 as Madhima comes in. Two truths are not separated. They all are within the same, same status. And

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.320
 then

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:21.960
 oppa is the middle way of the middle tanva lega. Or in some rather than teaching said,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:30.720
 like who follows the conduct in excellent activity as kriya tanthana and in a lay the practice

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:30.920
 level

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:38.120
 following the yoga tanthana is that. So it's like that, that is what the yoga. And so therefore,

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:45.000
 then yoga tanthana is the same. That means three out of ten, now yoga tanthana. Yoga tanthana is,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:53.320
 the top is yoga tanthana. That is again the same as kriya tanthana basically. And all is in

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:53.800
 absolute

00:43:53.800 --> 00:44:01.320
 level, everything is pure. Or as Madhima, everything is preformed for extremes and every extreme

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.120
 step.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.720
 And then at the level, everything is like in a mandala of the buddha-varajalas. Or the way I

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:14.920
 get daatas, mandalas. Everything in that mandala state. And in that also even though they appear

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:22.920
 in a different way, it is also in the same state, inseparable states. So that is what this again,

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:30.680
 two truths of yoga tanthas. And now we go to the Mahayoga's. And Mahayoga is then, this is what

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:38.680
 we practice most of the time. It's the best on Mahayoga and Anayoga teaching and Ahiyoga also

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:43.640
 teaching all Konwai and Toge. That's what most of the time our practice is the best.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:54.200
 In Mahayoga, what is this? At the relative level, everything is in three wajar state or two wajar

00:44:54.200 --> 00:45:04.040
 state. Everything is in three wajar states. Everything. Wajar form, wajar song and wajar

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:11.880
 speech. Everything. Everything. At the absolute level, everything is completely economic status.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:19.320
 These three things are never separated from at all that. This is not just a pure

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:28.040
 develop of that, but ordinary is pure, that it is state of this three wajar state or three mandala

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:34.940
 states. Everything in that status. So similar with the Kriya Tantra and the Yoga Tantra, but it's

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:35.480
 more

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:45.480
 expanded, more expanding, more deeply. Everything is in that status. Everything is ordinary in

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:45.720
 three

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:57.720
 wajar status. Status and that is totally equal. And what in the teaching you say and what again

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:06.200
 said, in the relative level, everything is pure. In the absolute level, everything is great

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:12.120
 economic status. These are the same that also like Sathya's in Goheghar Bhattathar, we learn.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:19.640
 What in Goheghar Bhattathar said, everything is enlightened. There's nothing even we can't,

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:26.840
 cannot, there's nothing that is not enlightened. Even Buddhas looking, searching, if there's

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:33.400
 something slightly is not enlightened, Buddha will cannot find everything that enlightens. And how

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:41.080
 all the 500 gets five dhyana buddhas and all the five elements are five criminal buddhas.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:52.840
 And what that is, what everything in that medallist. That is, but that is the true truth of the

00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:02.600
 Mahayoga practice. All that, everything in complete depth and great emptiness, great, great

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:12.840
 economic status there. And then in the Anayoga, what you say, all is a three mandala status.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:22.120
 Everything and everything is what we see. All is within the vastness space of the

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.960
 buddha samana bhadras. Vast the space of the buddha samana bhadra is the absolute truth.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:35.000
 It's all in the primal buddha, the absolute status.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:46.200
 And from that, the display of the variety of this environment is arising as samana bhadras.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:48:00.200
 Bhadras is all and that is relative truth. It's everything. And in reality, this both are

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:08.840
 completely joint target. We don't in separation. It is the great blissfulness

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:20.200
 mandala of the children's. Children's is all that joint within great blissfulness status.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:29.560
 So this is basically what in here is basically everything is within the mandala of this

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:37.240
 great nature, which is never separated from the blissfulness of the emptiness.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.760
 It's nature. It's not just enlightenment. Enlightenment is blissfulness.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:53.320
 That which is free from grasping and clinging and touching. That is what it is.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:49:01.640
 That that's what it is. So this is three mandala lemonas. Again, have I said,

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:10.840
 first samana bhadri is absolute truth. And then samana bhadra is relative truths.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:16.040
 And both are completely united within the state of the great blissfulness.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:22.680
 Blissfulness, there's no separations, no distractions. That way to understand.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:34.280
 And that, so this grace samana bhadra, samana bhadri, samana bhadri is the same as mademaka,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:44.360
 the absolute truth. Free from all extremes. And free from every conceptions and every

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:56.120
 areas, every centers. I mean, it is free from that nature. And then now we go to the zobtin status.

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:05.080
 Zobtin status is not just a focus externally. This now is coming, observing to the heart in a way,

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:11.800
 our nature of the mind. Nature of the mind, of mind is the source of everything.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:23.800
 Everything. Mind is the displays, the display, all this. The mind itself is totally enlightened.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:31.800
 Again, same thing. It's not just something looking to outside. It is within us, within ourselves.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:41.640
 How that is enlightened is three kaya status. Dharmakaya, Sambokaya and Nirmakaya status.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:48.920
 Totally enlightened. That is what we will come out of this. It's three kaya status.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:58.680
 Three kaya status, all these things. How this reflect, as we can say, according to Dzokilava,

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:06.360
 how this reflect in a way roughly says. All the open space is a reflection of the Dharmakayas,

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:15.080
 including space. And all the sound systems of this, whatever we see, is reflections of the

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:22.360
 Sambokaya energy of our own nature of the mind. And all the display of the tangible displays

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:30.120
 are the Nirmakaya displays, energy of our mind. And they are all in the same status. Even though

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:39.240
 they see different, emanate different, yet never lost their call to identity of the nature of the

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:49.400
 infinite in the freedom, openness, emptiness. That all moves within our vastness of our own

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:58.200
 nature of the mind, or our own mind. And our own mind is a three kaya state. That's what all

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:08.760
 display of the three kaya status. So if we say again, according to truths, the Dharmakaya is

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:19.960
 absolute truth. Sambokaya and Nirmakayas are related truths. Related truths. And all is same

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:30.520
 nature status. It's not two different, emanate difference is within the one everything is within

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:39.320
 within and everything is within everything or one is everything. That's how the nature is.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:48.600
 There is no contradictions. There is no extremes. That's how nature is functioning.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.800
 And nature is emerging, emerging, and then displays according to teaching. So this is now

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:04.200
 a brilliant overview and a strain of these two truths. That's how these two truths are.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.080
 Ah, like pervasive.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:14.200
 Well, so this is the general overview of that. So this is here,

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:21.720
 the gala master K. T. Mooji said in the commentary, he said according to the yanas,

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:31.720
 then this understanding of the two truths is getting to become deeper. That's what we

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:39.560
 should understand. And now we go to the, um, if you have any questions.
