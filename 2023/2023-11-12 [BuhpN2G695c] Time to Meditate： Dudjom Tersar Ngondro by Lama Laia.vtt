00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.640
 And so with great joy, devotion, even courage, commitment, once we really keep with things,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.240
 we make these offerings and make these requests again and again, turn the wheel of Dharma.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.760
 My great masters who've really, through their own joy, devotion, and courage, and commitment,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.240
 have truly followed the path and ripened their own mind and through their great compassion

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:43.800
 have given us all these beautiful, sublime, concise teachings to really drop into our

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.560
 heart and mind and use as tools to reveal our own natural peace that's always been

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.240
 here and wisdom.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.840
 And so with that, of course, is turning the wheel of our renunciation in our own minds

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:12.120
 and hearts to receive these distilled nectars, to just truly think of enlightenment and peace

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.200
 and fulfillment, not only for ourselves, but every single living being boundlessly throughout

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.640
 all time and place, throughout all the realms, that our practice, our study, our meditation

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.080
 can truly be a great unceasing benefit for all beings, having dispelled our own obscurations

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 and negative emotions.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.480
 And then, of course, as much as we can, connecting with the purity view of the three vatra states

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:56.600
 and the perfection of our situation, turning the three wheels of the three vehicles practiced

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.580
 indivisibly in our beautiful practice lineage.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:12.360
 How wonderful that we've come to do this and practice individually and together.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 And so part of what we're always doing on these days, too, is just reflecting a little

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.840
 bit upon the teachings and practices that we've heard from our great teachers, Kim Pose

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.640
 and Rinpoche, Kim Junphold and Rinpoche, who in their own way, again, repeat in one voice

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.680
 those of the great masters of the lineage of Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.160
 And so we have all these wonderful teachings and practices and we live, at least here,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:57.240
 I think for the most part, in a world that really is very active.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:07.000
 Very active in samsara level, you know, so many amazing ideas, brilliant ideas, so many

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 horrifying ideas and discouraging ideas, so many amazing things happening and so many

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.280
 horrifying things happening and everything in between.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.720
 And we are so blessed to have all these wonderful dharma practices, which we truly have come

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 to with confidence and trust and joy and devotion and we're all practicing to the best of our

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.000
 abilities and encouraging each other to continue.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.880
 How wonderful.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.360
 And then even with that, we can be very active with so many beautiful dharma teachings, so

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.040
 many beautiful dharma practices.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.600
 So I'm also kind of just thinking again how important it is like Rinpoche has said and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.240
 all the great masters that as we practice, as we move, whether it's our formal practice

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:17.120
 or as we're moving within our lives, really taking the time to reflect on how is my practice?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.800
 You know, how is our study?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520
 How is our contemplation?

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.160
 How is our actual meditation practice?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.760
 And again, not anybody else looking to our own mind and heart honestly, peacefully, joyfully

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.040
 because it's this that is going to lead to fulfillment, all right?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.560
 So like I think Rinpoche mentioned many times is quote, you know, how the signs of an educated

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:57.080
 person is that they tend to be more gentle and peaceful in their body, speech, mind demeanor.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:10.040
 Signs of realization are that, you know, less negative emotions.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.240
 And so of course, negative emotions can come all kinds of ways.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 But they're simply right, just connecting with them from our basic ignorance onward

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.320
 until all the echoing shake up of samsara's hopes and fears.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.280
 It's all happening with their own mind.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.760
 And again, we're here as beautiful practitioners.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.880
 So just again, encouragement as we go, use what Rinpoche always relates to as these three

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:46.760
 great assistants at all times, until we're fully enlightened Buddhas, our mindfulness,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:55.160
 our alertness, our conscientiousness, really just, I mean, it's a simplest thing, but I'm

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.720
 talking to myself too, just as we approach our lives, like just really checking in, you

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:14.600
 know, examining for ourself, our own mind and heart, you know, how, how is my practice?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.880
 How is it developing?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.760
 How much do we all, I mean, again, this isn't anything new, but really truly being present.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:39.280
 How is my loving kindness? How instinctive and kind of normal is it as far as being part

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.160
 of my, the atmosphere of my mind and heart in my days?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:57.640
 How is my joyful effort, my patience, my, you know, attunement to, you know, my commitments?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.880
 How's my concentration? How is my wisdom?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.960
 How much am I connecting with the four boundless wishes, you know?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.640
 How is my meditation, the quality of my meditation, you know, without judgment?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.480
 How much am I actually accumulating merit, accumulation merit practices?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.360
 How much am I really developing my ability for calm abiding and insight?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.040
 How much, you know, just to see how does my current motivation match up with my initial

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:47.840
 motivation for Dharma practice and study?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.560
 And I guess with all of this, again, kind of reflecting upon just the busyness of our

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.560
 world and the reification and deification of thoughts and ideas, which again can be

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.200
 wonderful, but again, as we all know, it's what is going on in our mind and heart that

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.400
 really makes all the difference.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:16.200
 And so, you know, the Buddha said so many times in so many ways, essentially, if we

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:27.040
 want to really apply his teachings, we really must train in shamatha and vipassana, calm

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.680
 abiding practice and insight.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.040
 Of course, all the other applications, but all the practices and medicate meditations

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.240
 we can do that really bring all the the hearing the teachings and contemplations into our

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.240
 mind and heart is through direct experience and our meditation.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:59.000
 So on every single level of the path, all the meditations, as we all know, they're all

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:09.720
 come under the categories of calm abiding and insight meditation.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.360
 So how how stable is our again, as part of this thing we check in with how stable is

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:26.400
 my ability to really relax and not be distracted to really relax and focus, whether it's a

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.800
 full out simplest, calm abiding of, you know, just remaining with our breath, or as we might

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.680
 add our visualizations and mantra recitations, you know, just watching ourselves and of course

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.920
 coming back.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.400
 And through that great stability, then of course, we have that great ground to then begin to

00:09:48.400 --> 00:10:03.880
 truly reflect on our own mind nature of our mind.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.200
 So I kind of started, you know, again, the Buddha was saying, I knew everyone who wants

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:15.440
 to practice follow my teachings and really apply them and train according to them should

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:27.980
 practice in calm abiding and in insight with the wish to attain enlightenment for all sentient

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:34.200
 beings, you know, the precious bodhicitta, which we do again every day with our nundra

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:41.280
 practice.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.640
 Great compassion and loving kindness.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:54.120
 Of course, on the relative level, that's really just again, connecting with that motivation

00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.600
 and commitment before all the enlightened ones and Buddhas bodhisattvas, you know, to

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.010
 attain enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, you know, with the four boundless

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:06.200
 applying

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.960
 the six paramitas.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:19.040
 And then on the ultimate level of bodhicitta, again, is that connecting with that insight

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:30.920
 into the unfabricated unborn, ceaselessly arising by nature like the sky, pristine nature of

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.440
 our Dharmakaya nature of our own mind, which again, we're doing with our practice.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.020
 And you know, there's all kinds of quotes, again, when, you know, bringing this back

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:49.520
 to that just as a checking in process, not to be discouraged by our current temporary

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.200
 emotional states, how much have we carried by them?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 I don't know.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.560
 And of course, at least for me, it varies, right?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.380
 But not to be discouraged and just remember again, these words, the undeceiving words

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:13.240
 of the Buddha, that just the thought of enlightenment of bodhicitta, enlightenment of all beings

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:20.600
 and the motivation that all beings realize that the Buddha said, the merit of just that

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:30.800
 thought is, if that could be made substantial, it would fill all, it would surpass all of

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.640
 space.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.280
 It would surpass infinity, I mean, such is the nature.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:48.520
 And he also said, again, according to what our current capacities might be, he used the

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:55.000
 analogy of the, of a diamond, or like, you know, like the diamond, the actual substantial

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.040
 gem, the diamond gets in that liberation of Maitreya.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:11.120
 And then that the Buddha is saying something like, a diamond, even if it's shattered, there

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.160
 might be just a fragment of a diamond, still, its brilliance outshines all of, you know,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.640
 the beautiful golden ornaments.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:30.160
 And then the Buddha said, even if we may not fully recognize the diamond of our bodhicitta,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.040
 meaning we might not have fully actualized our bodhicitta, or it might be a little weak,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.880
 but we still have the wish, the thought of bodhicitta.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.400
 That is also like outshines all of, you know, here he's making the metaphor and the levels

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.320
 of realization of the path.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:14:00.960
 It outshines that diamond of bodhicitta intention of the bodhisattva, outshines all of the golden

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.240
 ornaments of like the shravakas and the pratyaka buddhas.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:13.240
 And just like that little fragment of diamond is still worth a lot and will relieve poverty,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:20.680
 that little glimmer of bodhicitta is still going to dispel the poverty of samsaras eventually,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:33.700
 but right, but we're trying to keep with that and continue with our practice, you know,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:40.180
 and just also create more conditions for what is going to actually help us.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:46.960
 So even just looking at those simple, you know, qualities of the outer hermitage, the

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:59.920
 inner hermitage, you know, as far as what are good circumstances for stabilizing our

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.160
 ability to relax and focus, you know, while we're subject to conditions, then that means

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.840
 we're just going to try to as much as we can be in a place that's healthy, where our basic

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:21.440
 needs are covered, that's a healthy environment, you know, where there's not a lot of trouble

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:32.240
 coming from others. And also on the inner level, we have less desire, more contentment,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:40.240
 less desire for just worldly, you know, kind of more extraneous things, and more contentment

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:47.440
 with what we have and the riches of what we have. And we're able to, you know, kind of

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:55.600
 abandon our negative emotions and actions and connect with positive activities and motivations

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:02.560
 of our three doors. And then actually doing the practice, which again, I won't go over

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:10.960
 instructions of shamatha, but relaxing, focusing. And then again, the basic, you know, conditions

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:20.480
 for bringing out our insight and wisdom is, of course, what the precious teacher, the

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:34.120
 teachings, hearing them, reflecting on them, meditating. Again, you know, in the beginning,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.040
 we might, again, in this level of checking in and just knowing like the Buddha says,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:45.520
 keep going, keep going, we want to move through all the paths, through all the stages of

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520
 realization

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.800
 to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. And that first starts with having

00:16:51.800 --> 00:17:01.520
 some, even though it might be intellectual, some understanding of what's being said and

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:08.960
 what the practice is. So we have that basic understanding, we have understanding. And

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.960
 then that starts to, you know, we have realists begin to have more realization and that becomes

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:26.600
 stabilized on the path. So again, just just like our faith and our devotion increases

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:37.480
 as we expose ourselves more with our practice, our bodhicitta deepens and expands as we continue

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:45.640
 with our practice, have more understanding of our practice. Our renunciation, our joy

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:52.840
 and appreciation, our renunciation increases as we continue with our understanding of the

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.520
 teachings and the practice. And as we continue with that, we begin to have more and more

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:06.940
 glimpses in direct perception of the meaning of the words of the teachings and the ideas

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:13.760
 we're hearing that we're so drawn to and feel comfort with, but really allowing them to

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:20.640
 enter our experience. And even with that, we're still going to have our habitual patterns

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:29.440
 and obscurations, but still continuing and purifying, accumulating our merit, purifying

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:39.360
 our obscurations, admitting our mistakes and moving on, continuing to accumulate our merit

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.480
 and acting to the best of our abilities with mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:54.960
 And we're going to be into that stability, the unshakable state of realization of like

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:04.680
 of Buddhahood, where we truly are fully realized in of the three Vajras states of the three

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:12.200
 Kaya state is completely pure and rely fully realized. And with that inseparable with that

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:21.000
 is our bodhicitta fully unveiled and ripened effortlessly, naturally benefiting all beings,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:32.480
 renunciations complete. There's nothing, nothing to needed. And then I think Rinpoche said

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.000
 that as far as these stages the Buddha gave us of like the stages of realization from

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.320
 ordinary being, entering the path and this contemplating meditating all the way those

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.240
 stages of realization up to Buddhahood, you know, what we know, we've heard the five paths,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:20:00.240
 the path of accumulation, the path of joining or application, the path of seeing, the path

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:07.680
 of meditation, and the path of no more learning. So I think one, in one way in the teachings

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.200
 Kenpoche said, when we first beginning the path, that's when we're just beginning to

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:21.680
 have some understanding. And then we want to continue with application means we're joining,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.000
 we're joining what we've heard with our, our experience. And that's where our realization

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.400
 we have more and more glimpses of realization and direct perception and of our freedom state

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:41.080
 of our wisdom, our love, our compassion that's uncontrived, right? And real path of seeing

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:48.200
 is that full blown realization that we see the direct directly, the complete openness,

00:20:48.200 --> 00:21:00.400
 the egolessness of ourselves and of all phenomena, right? And even then, on the path of meditation,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.080
 which is all through the other stages of the boomings of the bodhisattvas is when we're

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:12.000
 stabilizing that realization and all the more subtle knowledge obscurations are being purified

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.320
 until again, the path of no more learning, which is Buddhahood. Some get it quick, some

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:33.920
 get it over three countless aons or more, but we want to keep with it. So maybe that's

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.360
 enough talking for the moment. But my main point is, yeah, I think we all know it, but

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:50.180
 we all have varied times of the season, varied things happening in our lives and in our world.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.120
 And just really want to encourage myself and all of us to really keep with this precious

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:04.080
 opportunity and really do keep going. Like, you know, I think also in like the great Prajna

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.440
 Paramita Mantra, Rinpoche's have mentioned many times, one of the meanings of that is also

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.720
 all these stages of the path being fully realized. So just we keep going, we check in with our

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:31.080
 qualities of how much we are actually embodying our values and of the Dharma and the world

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:38.360
 and how much our ability to especially with our meditation to really be with that so easy

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.240
 to be busy. And sometimes I know for myself, the only quiet moment in the day might be

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.920
 to sit down and practice, but kind of moving through those stages of like just letting

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.680
 go and relaxing and then really working on developing the ability to relax and not be

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:03.080
 distracted to be able to focus and really follow the instructions we have considering

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:11.960
 like looking to the nature of our mind, developing our wisdom, you know, holding the beautiful

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:21.360
 union of our really fortunate outer circumstances with our inner treasure of our own qualities

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:30.600
 of body, speech and mind. And with great devotion, thinking of our teachers who are the embodiment

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.720
 and the full fruition of all the Buddhas of the three times, you know, that's the essence

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:45.160
 of our practice, joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, pure perception, that's the essence of our

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:55.800
 Anundra practice, that guru yoga that's pervading every aspect of purifying our obscurations,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:02.040
 connecting with wisdom, accumulating positive karma. It's all distilled here in our practice.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.000
 So we will do our practice. Thank you.
