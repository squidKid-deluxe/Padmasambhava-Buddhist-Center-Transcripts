NOTE     "synopsis": "\"The Middle Way View\"\n\nBrief Teaching and Practice on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nwith Lama Dragpa\n\nSaturday, November 6\n3:30-5:30pm EDT\n\n\n--\n\n\nFood for Thought for Lama Dragpa\u2019s unabashedly Buddhist talk on \u201cThe Middle Way View\u201d on Saturday, Nov. 6th from 3:30-5:30pm, which will also include a full practice of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro.\n\n\nI love swimming in the deep end of the Buddhadharma\u2014in fact, Vajrayana practice assumes that this is where we\u2019re hanging out in order for our practice to stay on track.\n\n\nSo reviewing key points is always helpful for me. Hopefully it will be helpful for you too!\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s warmly welcome. I\u2019ll walk through this deep topic systemically, point by point, one step at a time. Enjoy!\n\n\nThere are 3 mutually-supportive ways of understanding and performing emptiness.\n\n\n1. Second Turning of Rangtong\n(qualitative emptiness of intrinsic existence)\n+\n2. Third Turning of Shentong\n(\u201csubstantive\u201d ground of all being)\n+\n3. Vajrayana and Dzogchen\n(postconceptual \u201c4th time\u201d)\n=\nmore fully integrated lineage approach to emptiness\n\n\nEach approach to emptiness offers a key, distinct function that cannot be omitted without compromising important 9 yana insight to thoroughly bake the cake of enlightenment.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick connection that might be interesting to think about in terms of reframing the 3 ways of understanding and performing emptiness.\n\n\nAccording to certain Nyingma lineage Mahayoga pith instructions for practicing the Union of Creation and Completion Stages, there are 3 key points that have to be simultaneously performed and verified in one\u2019s personal experience for one\u2019s practice to be \u201cauthentic,\u201d or to bring swift results: (1) clarity (salwa), (2) purity (dagpa), and (3) stability or fearlessness (tanpa).\n\n\nTo some degree, these 3 points correlate with framing emptiness as simultaneously being a quality, \u201csubstance,\u201d and nonconceptual awareness. If these aren\u2019t simultaneously enacted (due to mastery), at least none of them can be conceptually omitted without reducing the 3-D complexity of emptiness into 2-D or 1-D over-simplifications that omit big, vital chucks of Dharma and distort fundamental contributions of the Nyingma practice lineage of the Inner Tantras.\n\n\n1. Clarity: intricate particulars of one\u2019s visualization (representation) of substantial features of the container and the contained (the apparent \u201cthe world\u201d such as bodies, environment, and oneself) which gradually becomes a direct seeing of pure relative truth as one\u2019s concepts become more accurate, and eventually included within a larger scope of post-conceptual wisdom awareness that allows subject-object duality to arise, but without reifying appearances into exclusive binaries, but rather accommodates them as inclusive polarities that are integrated from this \u201chigher,\u201d more comprehensive \u201cwisdom\u201d awareness.\n\n\n2. Purity: the quality of lacking inherent true existence (quality), or alternatively, abiding in nonconceptual wisdom awareness that doesn\u2019t reify experience even as it allows percepts and concepts to emerge (as wisdom display, or tsal)\n\n\n3. Stability: Unwavering conviction or certainty wisdom that stably, one-pointedly remains in nonconceptual wisdom with \u201cvajra pride\u201d without attaching to or avoiding the natural arising energy of the nature of mind.\n\n\nSo in a way, from the Inner Tantric practice that eventually leads to direct yogic perception (or the fourth time, which always already includes these 3 other performances of emptiness) . . .\n\n\nClarity: emptiness as apparent \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cground\u201d\n\n\nPurity: as the pure quality of this groundless ground when it\u2019s not reified\n\n\nStability: abiding in non-reifying, nonconceptual awareness that still allows for all the other accurate ways of mind to function, while it also clearly knows the deluded, distorted, fixated ways the mind functions having been there and done that, without needing to collapse into that mode presently.\n\n\nSimply put, we experience everything (the world; the ground) as pure display (emptiness-appearance; groundless) with nonconceptual wisdom (emptiness-awareness; unframed).\n\n\nThis means \u201cit\u2019s all always already transcendental wisdom rainbow body,\u201d yet allows plenty of (conceptual and experiential) space for mistaken nightmares of samsaric vision to happen throughout sentient interpretations of time and space.\n\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Warm greetings. Welcome, everyone. Welcome. So we'll begin as we usually begin, which is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.200
 to very intentionally and consciously awaken our natural goodness, our bodhicitta, the heart-mind

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.760
 of enlightenment. So we'll just brightly turn that on with full of confidence and joy and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 enthusiasm, and then we'll really kind of orient this time together, that it'll be of

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 ultimate benefit for all beings, both bringing them immediate happiness in all ways right

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.360
 now, and then also very soon the enlightenment and freedom from all suffering and its causes

00:00:49.360 --> 00:01:16.440
 as well. So we'll just turn on bodhicitta right now. Thanks so much. So early homage

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.040
 to the lineage masters, homage to Buddhist Sakimuni, homage to Guru Rinpoche, homage to

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.400
 this stainless golden mountain range of pristine lineage masters. So today we're going to dive

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.120
 deeply into the middle-wave view, which is in one way, just kind of by an honest assessment,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.080
 we're kind of showing up really late to the party. This has been taught by the Buddhist

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.280
 Sakimuni for 2500 years ago, and it's continually been taught and practiced by this lineage

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.720
 of masters, and it's actually perfect timing right now. We've all arrived to receive these

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.240
 precious golden nugget teachings that have been preserved uninterruptedly without any

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 mistaken errors or kind of mixing in opinions and conceptualizations. So here we are, we

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.680
 get to be together for a short little window of time and discuss something as profound

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.600
 and vast as the middle-wave view, which is really the elixir of all the troubles we'll

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.640
 ever experience and all the different suffering we've ever gone through. So we'll just take

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 a minute to pause and really like honor that, that we're really kind of midstream here.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 Everything that we're doing here together is like because of the kindness and the perseverance

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.480
 of these lineage masters, these elders and ancestors that have really persevered to fully

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.960
 reveal their true nature. So that's why we have this opportunity now, and it's always

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.560
 important to really reconnect with that lineage and the blessings of those masters and the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.140
 living lineage wisdom that they worked so hard to realize and also to preserve and continue

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.440
 to make available for us now. So this is a really, really big topic, and we're going

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.840
 to do kind of like a highlight reel, okay, of the Madhyamaka middle-wave view. So we'll

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.800
 just jump right in. There's two approaches to the Buddha Dharma. They both have the same

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.960
 purpose to reveal all obscurations and to totally remove these obscurations and fully reveal

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.600
 our natural goodness qualities. So that's what all the teachings, 84,000 teachings of

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.440
 the Buddha are designed to do, remove the temporary obscurations, the veils of ignorance

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 that are covering up our natural goodness, and to fully disclose or reveal the innate

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.480
 goodness qualities we have. All the teachings are designed for this purpose. And there's

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.040
 two general approaches towards these teachings, and one is the approach of the scholar, and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.640
 the other is the approach of the meditator. And both of these are legitimate paths, and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.600
 people of all types and varieties have taken both of these paths and achieved full enlightenment

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.240
 and fruition by applying the techniques and the teachings according to their own dispositions,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.080
 whether they want to do a more scholarly approach or a more practice-oriented direct meditator

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 approach. So either of these paths are fully available to us. And as a ningma school, actually

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 we're asked by Gurumache and these lineage masters to always do both together. We call

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.320
 this study and practice. We're honoring the scriptural lineage as well as the practice

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.360
 or realization lineage. These always go hand in hand in the ningma school of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.880
 And so it's not so much like a... It's something we'll always have to check in on both sides

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.960
 of this. And what a scholastic approach generally does is starts more with what's outside, what's

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.280
 more obvious, tangible, exterior, objective. And then looking closely, closely, closely,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.400
 it gets more and more inside till it kind of had the resounding question of like, how

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.280
 is my subjective engagement, this knower, this awareness, how is it influencing what

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.560
 is known, this appearance. So the scholastic approach is a little more gradual, but it's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.320
 also very thorough. We start outside with what's very obvious and tangible. We look

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.600
 at it closely and gradually we come to investigate the looker, who's actually performing that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:39.120
 investigation. On the other hand, the meditator approach jumps directly into their own awareness.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.040
 How is my cognizance, my mind, this awareness, this consciousness, what is it? How does it

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.680
 work? How does it influence experience? What is its nature? These are direct meditator

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 kind of questions or inquiries that we're... We have all these sets of teachings to jump

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.490
 into and look for ourselves. The Buddha encouraged that. Both of these approaches to very

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.100
 thoroughly

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.240
 check what's going on here. So whether we're looking at what's outside, that's generally

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 called ontology being, a study of being of what is, or epistemology knowing, how do we

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.760
 know what is. Either of these approaches are legitimate paths in Buddhism and they actually

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.720
 go hand in hand. Ontology and epistemology, the study of being and knowing of the knower

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.040
 and the known are always together.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.780
 In Buddhism in general, and in the Nyingma school in particular,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.200
 study and practice always go hand in hand.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.720
 So we can take either of these approaches.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.880
 And the great compassionate kindness teacher,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.520
 Buddha Shakyamuni, was so generous

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.760
 in how he made the teachings available to us,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.000
 to our readiness, to our dispositions, to our faculties,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.680
 to our preferences, to our habits, to our biases,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.680
 to our prejudices, to our ways of being stuck

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.720
 and way of being open.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.400
 He was so kind.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 And they say there's three general phases

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.320
 that the Buddha taught.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.540
 One is called the phase of no analysis.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.560
 The second is called the phase of slight analysis.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.200
 The third is called the phase of thorough analysis.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.520
 So at the first level of the Buddha's teachings,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.960
 the no analysis level, the Buddha just

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.080
 agreed with what was commonly held to be true.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.400
 For example, there is suffering.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.560
 The Buddha said this is commonly held belief.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.760
 OK, I won't analyze that any further.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.920
 I'll agree, there's suffering.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.960
 So what are we going to do about it?

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.960
 What is the cause?

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.840
 Is it possible to fully remove suffering,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.400
 the cause of suffering?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.280
 What's the path?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.800
 What are the steps, the tools we have

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.120
 to perform and engage to actually discover

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.360
 the cessation of suffering?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.080
 This is the level of no analysis.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.480
 The Buddha just agreed with our worldly kind

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.480
 of common, mundane ideas, what we consider common sense.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.960
 There is a person.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.360
 We're in a building.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.320
 The Buddha didn't challenge any of this.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.040
 He didn't-- no analysis, no further investigation

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.040
 on this level of the teachings.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.200
 OK, the second level is called slight analysis.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.960
 And this is refuting our grasping onto the existence

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.600
 of things like suffering, house, me, person, path,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.680
 enlightenment.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.120
 The Buddha did a slight analysis.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.200
 And he said, there is no such thing as true existence.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.320
 I don't truly exist.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.720
 You don't truly exist.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.120
 The path doesn't truly exist.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.920
 The house doesn't truly exist.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.480
 Enlightenment does not truly exist.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.320
 So the Buddha used conceptions to look more closely,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.040
 little more analysis, to help remove our grasping

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.160
 onto this fixed tension.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.520
 We really believe these things are happening.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.280
 I'm suffering.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.200
 I need relief from suffering.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.480
 There's a bad thing happening.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.560
 There's a good thing I want.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.160
 The Buddha said, look closely, analyze, loosen.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.120
 Loosen the view.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.080
 Open the awareness.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.800
 Let a little more curiosity in.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.760
 Look a little more closely.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.720
 If we look really closely, we won't really

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.680
 find a substantially existent permanent thing anywhere.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.880
 The idea of a singular, independent, permanent entity

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.920
 is complete fiction.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.720
 Everything has parts.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.640
 Everything arises in dependence on other things.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.040
 And everything is impermanent.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.560
 Sip, singular, independent, permanent.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.160
 There's no such thing that exists in all of the universe.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.840
 If we think it, feel it exists, that's one thing.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.880
 If we look more closely, the little more analysis,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.840
 we won't be able to find that.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.760
 It is unfindable.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.520
 And that leads us to the third phase

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.040
 of the Buddha's teaching, thorough analysis.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.800
 So at this phase, the Buddha wasn't just

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.400
 saying use concepts to kind of understand,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.160
 having a better conceptual map, a more refined, intelligent kind

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.080
 of way to argument or to kind of locate my experience.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.840
 But to actually be in non-conceptual wisdom

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.840
 awareness, not duality consciousness,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.240
 not dualistic mind, not subject and object,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.600
 not a framework that has a me in here

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.760
 and a something other than me out there,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.840
 a subject and an object.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.080
 Before that layer of filtering happens

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.000
 in my own immediate experience, before that happens,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.400
 recognize how the mind is with prajna.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.000
 Wisdom, non-conceptual wisdom awareness.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Unborn, unceasing, by nature like the sky,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.440
 experienced by self-reflexive awarenesses,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.760
 discerning, pristine cognition.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.520
 This is the great master, Shantrakshita,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.920
 added to the beginning of the heart sutra.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.400
 It's pointing to the middle way view, the lived experience

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.480
 of what it's like to be in non-conceptual wisdom

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.400
 awareness.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.520
 This is the lived experience of the middle way view.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.240
 Unborn, unceasing, by nature like the sky,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.000
 experienced by self-reflexive awarenesses,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.800
 discerning, pristine cognition.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.920
 So this is the topic that we're discussing today,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.760
 the middle way view.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.800
 So if we look, take a kind of step back

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.000
 from this no analysis, slight analysis, thorough analysis,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.800
 the ways that Buddha generally made his teachings a little

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.160
 more direct to the true nature, the way enlightened beings

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.640
 experience things, not the way deluded sentient beings,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.520
 like myself, experience things, the way enlightened beings

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.840
 experience things, this first turning of the wheel of Dharma,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.520
 the four noble truths, cause and effect, interdependence.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.280
 That is this no analysis level.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.200
 The second turning is called rangtong, empty of self,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.440
 empty of fixed self, empty of fixed identity, rangtong.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.800
 These are the heart sutra teachings, the prajnaparamita

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.440
 sutras that the Buddha gave.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.480
 This is slight analysis and thorough analysis.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.120
 The Buddha both said when we look closer,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.920
 nothing fits those conceptual frameworks.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.920
 Nothing truly exists in the way we feel it might.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.880
 If we look even closer, we'll pop into absolute awareness,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.200
 what we call prajna, non-conceptual wisdom

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.520
 awareness, this is thorough analysis.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.320
 So in the Madhyamaka, our middleweight teachings,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.760
 this is saying the first part, slight analysis is going beyond

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.880
 all-- sorry, slight analysis is lacking or empty

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.040
 of intrinsic existence or inherent existence,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.480
 no fixed identity.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.720
 There is no such thing as a fixed property, identity,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.680
 pattern, person, place, thing.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.560
 That is mistaken belief.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.840
 It's just a false belief.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.160
 Those things don't exist.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.600
 Then the Buddha so kindly said, oh, we

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.280
 might grasp onto non-existence.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.880
 They don't exist.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.480
 Nothing exists.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.840
 No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.760
 So nothing.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.120
 The Buddha said, no.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.120
 Third turning-- or sorry, this is in the thorough analysis.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.560
 Look at, in your own awareness, how it functions when it's not

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.680
 conceptualizing at all.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.080
 And this, the middleweight teachings,

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:27.040
 say, going beyond conceptual designation, non-conceptual,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.960
 before conceptual layering happens, being wisdom.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.880
 It's called natural mind, ordinary mind.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.440
 There's different-- the Buddha taught so many ways about this.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.360
 Then the third turning teachings are,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.520
 what is it actually like when we experience

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.000
 non-conceptual wisdom awareness?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.880
 What's that like?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.320
 What is it not?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.200
 But what is it like?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.280
 Then this is the third turning teachings.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.160
 Shintong, empty of other, empty of what's

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.040
 other than the natural qualities of mind.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.600
 Rongtong is empty of self.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.800
 There's no fixed identity.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.080
 That's second turning.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.480
 Third turning is empty of other.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.840
 All the adventitious, temporary obscurations,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.160
 when they're removed, what's left?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.840
 The Buddha taught-- the tatagatagarbha,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.480
 the Buddha nature's left.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.720
 This is the middleweight view.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.360
 This is how our mind functions with all

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.000
 of its beautiful qualities, love, compassion, and wisdom.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.600
 All the extraordinary capacities and qualities of enlightened

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.520
 wisdom awareness is Buddha activities.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.280
 They're all kind of coming from this third turning

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.480
 of the wheel of dharma, Shintong, teachings

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.320
 on the Buddha nature.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:16:01.400
 Then fourth turning, some people say, is Vajrayana techniques.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.160
 There's a big, long-term, centuries-old big discussion

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.000
 about what's the definitive teaching of a Buddha.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.800
 How do Buddhas experience things?

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.280
 How do they kind of, in a way, cater

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.400
 to the individual limitations of sentient beings?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.720
 Not provisional.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.840
 Not a temporary way that's like a stepping stone

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.840
 for beings to use.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.800
 But how do Buddhas experience things?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.240
 Definitive truth.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.080
 The great master Jangang Mipham Rinpoche

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.520
 said the definitive teaching of the Buddha

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.800
 is the union of the second and third turnings

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.320
 of Rongtong and Shintong, empty in self and empty of other.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.360
 Empty of any fixation at all.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.720
 That's called nondual wisdom.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.760
 And what is that like when it's empty of all the other things

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.600
 that are unnatural and it's just entirely natural?

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.920
 This is Buddha nature.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.800
 So this is the groundless ground.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.960
 This is the middleweight view.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.200
 There's no big debate over whether second turnings

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.520
 are more definitive and third turnings more definitive.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.280
 Their union is what's definitive,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.360
 according to the great master Jangang Mipham Rinpoche.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.200
 As our kind, compassionate, and extraordinary teachers,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.760
 Venerable Kempa Rinpoche has taught in their Shirdra series.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.560
 All these books-- there's so many books here.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.520
 They've laid all these things out extensively, so kindly.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.000
 All according to the great master Longchenpa and Mipham

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.080
 Rinpoche and these great lineage masters.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.040
 These are really just waiting to be opened up and pursued

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.320
 and it's such a delight.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.480
 This is a treasure trove of teachings for us.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.320
 We can, if we want to take an eight-year program

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.240
 to become a Kempo or a Kenmo or a Geshe or a Gesheima,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.680
 21 years.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.840
 We can also, if we want something more suitable

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.120
 to the wild, contemporary, I never have any time,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.520
 21st century, we can look at these books

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.120
 and it's like a very extensive highlights

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.080
 from these great masters that it is still

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.280
 the essence of both the scholastic path

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.080
 and the practitioner path.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.040
 And the key points we have to have in order for our practice

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.680
 to stay on track to follow in the footsteps of the Buddha.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:22.720
 I'm just giving a quick highlight reel here.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.200
 This is a very extensive thing.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.080
 Right?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.880
 I've said things that are totally revolutionary

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.200
 that don't make any sense in an ordinary view.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.360
 There's no person.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.440
 There's no path.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.800
 Wisdom awareness.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.600
 I mean, you see that on the evening news.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.320
 Are they talking about anything like that?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.200
 There's no suffering, no end of suffering, no birth,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.720
 no old age, no sickness, no death.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 All we get is birth, old age, sickness, and death

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.840
 on the news.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840
 Right?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.600
 That's the level of no analysis, superficial,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.200
 typical distorted ordinary sentient being ideas.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.240
 And we actually believe them.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.840
 And so the Buddha taught us so kindly how to look more closely

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.400
 and come out of such a distorted perception, which when we

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.040
 believe it feels so real.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.360
 We have this entire path at our disposal

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.320
 to really go through systematically

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.640
 and look at ourself, look at our experience,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.600
 and free ourselves from this trouble that our own mind keeps

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.520
 causing itself.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.600
 It's the only way out.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.800
 This is the only way out.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.600
 I'm not saying Buddhism is the only way out.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.720
 I'm saying this level of inquiry,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.600
 following through and actually refining

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.760
 our conceptualization, having a more clear discernment,

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.440
 more valid cognition, is the only way to freedom.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.760
 Everything else is a band-aid.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.480
 We can save this planet a million times over,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.920
 but once the sun no longer produces heat, it's gone.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.160
 We're gone.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.800
 We can have a good stretch of some,

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.400
 I don't know, 10 billion years or so.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.240
 It's a big stretch.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.800
 Evolutionarily, it's a big stretch.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.680
 In terms of all the kalpas the Buddha taught,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.160
 this is like a tiny little dewdrop in the ocean of time.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.280
 We've been going in this ocean of suffering forever,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.200
 literally, beginningless time.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.560
 This is the only way to freedom.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.280
 Doing this inquiry ourselves, it's the only way.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.920
 That is definitely a lion's roar of Buddhist acumenity.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:34.120
 So while this may be seen philosophical,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.800
 that's actually quite experiential,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.080
 and it really does alleviate suffering, our own suffering,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.320
 and how we give harm beings a little less in the process.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.320
 We become more compassionate and more kind.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.360
 So I'm just really quickly jumping through these highlight

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.280
 points.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.440
 I'm in no way saying this is all the condensed exhaustive

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.880
 explanation or something of a eight-year program,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.960
 21-year program.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.400
 I'm just saying highlight points that we have to really

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.800
 get familiar with to practice and absorb these teachings

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.980
 thoroughly, because these are lived experiences that we

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.640
 actually believe in right now.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.680
 This is not just about historical figures

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.840
 and some lineage masters way back when.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.400
 We really believe suffering is truly existing.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.260
 I do.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.520
 I really believe I'm here.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.840
 I really believe my story.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.320
 I really believe in concepts, certain concepts,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.360
 like time and space.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.900
 I really believe that.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.220
 The Buddha said that's all false.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.080
 Relative truth is artificial, fabricated, deceptive,

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.320
 delusory, like a husk that falls off

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.240
 of what's truly the core.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.080
 This is all false.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.640
 So then he gave us a path to gradually,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.120
 if we want to look, gradually open up

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.080
 to consider the truth of this teaching

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.320
 so we can actually be free, free of our own self-deception,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.360
 free of not seeing our own unborn, sky-like nature

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.920
 of mind, the middle way view.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.080
 All these teachings are about how to recognize and abide

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.440
 in the middle way view.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.800
 So I'll lay some more foundation.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.680
 The Buddha taught four philosophical schools.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.680
 And like all of these teachings we're going over

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.240
 and the nine yanas according to the Nyingma school,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.240
 they all lead to another step.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.880
 It's called yarden, geared forward.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.080
 Each step, we're on it, leans us into the next step.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.440
 That step, we're on that, leans us into the next step.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.640
 They're geared to the next.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.640
 That's how the sequence of the nine yanas work.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.040
 They're not against each other.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.360
 It naturally extends into the next step.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.080
 Each subyana or subvehicle, sublevel,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.760
 it'll gradually open up into the next level

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.440
 if we keep that inquiry going.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.960
 The Buddha said that's just how reality functions.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.200
 And each step is a little closer, a little more detailed,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.140
 a little more complete, a little more

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.560
 expressive of the true nature of the middle way

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.520
 view of how enlightened beings perceive things.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.720
 Each yana does that.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.840
 It's a little more directly from our own pristine valid

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.280
 cognition.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.080
 And it's a little less relying on our distorted habitual

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.840
 dualistic consciousness.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.720
 Each yana is higher that way, more inclusive.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.840
 It's greater.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.240
 It includes more of the true nature.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.360
 The techniques more directly jump us or pop us

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.760
 into our true nature.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.400
 That's how the yana sequence works.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:49.240
 This first school is called Vibhashika,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.160
 great exposition school.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.440
 This is like a so-called foundational Buddhism

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.600
 or Hinayana approach.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.440
 And there's many beliefs they hold.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.200
 But one belief they hold that I want to highlight here

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:07.440
 is there are two things in life, mind and body.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.520
 Call it material, non-material.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.640
 And each of these are made up of two things.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.600
 Body is made up of irreducible particles of time

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:27.620
 and irreducible particles of physical units of space.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.040
 That's matter.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.400
 Teeny, teeny, teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:38.680
 cannot be split any further, units of time and space.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.640
 And then mind is made up of two things,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:52.040
 indivisible units of mind and the felt sense of self, me.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.800
 One is like, what actually is the mind?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.960
 These indivisible units of mind.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.880
 And what experience is that?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.460
 Me, my sense of me, felt sense of self.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.880
 The Vibhashika school, great exposition school,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.320
 believed this.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.680
 This is really close to like a contemporary modern science.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.680
 There's still the contemporary modern science.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.840
 We're looking for the smallest unit, the smallest particle

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.160
 that makes up all of other aggregate reality.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.520
 Now it's contemporary to think of it as strings,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.040
 11 dimensional strings.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.400
 The Buddha said to keep looking.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.720
 And so the strings are going to dissolve too,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.800
 dissolve under analysis.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.160
 You'll find smaller units.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.880
 Keep looking, keep looking, keep looking.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.400
 Eventually we'll get to irreducible units

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.120
 of time, space, mind, and a sense of self.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.080
 And that's everything that exists,

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.480
 according to Vibhashika school.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.120
 This is way beyond what we see on the news

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.360
 or what we talk about in our daily conversations.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.160
 And the Buddha said, you can experience this.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.640
 In the Pali tradition, it's called Bhanga.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.960
 The felt experience that you're just this vibrating aggregate

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.040
 of indivisible particles can experience it.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.140
 So this is really much more subtle

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.400
 than our typical ordinary average way of experiencing things.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.280
 Because it actually can be experienced,

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.680
 not just theoretically asserted.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.920
 Or, you know, we haven't seen strings, you know.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.480
 They're all, it's like math, more or less math.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.320
 Mathematically, we need strings to make the math work.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:40.160
 So largely this is just like looking outside.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.800
 I haven't started looking at the looker that much yet.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.880
 This is a, quantum physics is 100 years old now.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.200
 It's not some new thing on the block.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.520
 This is a century old.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.600
 The Buddha taught more subtle than this 2,500 years ago.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.880
 I'm just saying, not that science is bad,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.860
 but science has a lot to learn from Buddhism.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.200
 If scientists like logic

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.880
 and they like a kind of objective verification, that's great.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.420
 They can come and hang out with the Buddhists

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.480
 and learn about that.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.120
 But Buddhists have more than that.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.420
 That's when we get to the next school,

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.320
 Sultrontica school, the Sutra school.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.880
 This is the Buddha taught.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.080
 The Buddha taught all these schools as our mind opens,

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.760
 then the Buddha taught the next step,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.600
 geared forward to the next view.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.360
 The Sultrontica school, they kind of,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.720
 so there's so many points here, you can go over,

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.040
 but like a fundamental distinction

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.200
 between Sultrontica school and Vibhashika.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.840
 Sultrontica school, they think,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.440
 okay, so say there's these irreducible particles out there

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.920
 of time and space and mind and sense of self.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.400
 That these little physical things out there,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.040
 we never directly perceive them.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.640
 How can mind perceive matter?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.180
 Because they're fundamentally different things.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.760
 Mind and matter are material and immaterial.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.720
 How can they ever understand each other or come in contact?

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.880
 Because they're of different types.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.960
 Makes no sense for them to contact actually,

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.440
 in Buddhist logic.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.280
 So what the Sultrontica school asserted

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.440
 is that we never actually directly experience matter.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.380
 We only ever directly experience our image of matter.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.060
 Like there are these irreducible particles

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.200
 that are so tiny you can never directly perceive them.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.320
 They're imperceptible.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.120
 But we only ever experience our cognition,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.360
 our mental overlay, our conceptual construction

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.320
 of the matter.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.000
 Never directly experience matter, ever.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.440
 We just experience our projection.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.200
 All we ever experience is our projection.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.320
 That's the Sultrontica.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:03.780
 There are these little irreducible bits of space and time.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.020
 We never directly experience them.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.400
 We just have a generalized overlay

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.380
 that are our own projections.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.040
 So these are both so-called

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.820
 the foundational Buddhism philosophical schools.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.920
 They also believe that to achieve enlightenment

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.260
 is a very rare thing that happens.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.780
 It's a very special kind of being like Gautama Buddha,

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.520
 who could achieve that.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.760
 The pinnacle realization for most beings is our hot hood.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.040
 They refuted the existence of Alayavijnana,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.640
 the ground storehouse consciousness.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.760
 They don't believe in the Bhumis, the five past.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.220
 They refute three Kayas.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.640
 They don't believe in these higher teachings.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.040
 The Buddha didn't teach those in the sutras.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.200
 And these sutras that they're focusing on.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.880
 So then they're just following the words of the Buddha,

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.080
 specifically the Sultrontica view.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.600
 They really didn't want to mix any other commentaries.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.080
 They just wanted to try to go directly

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.480
 with the words of the Buddha.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:13.360
 And they only relied on very specific teachings of the Buddha.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.760
 They were more kind of available at that time.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.140
 So then what we get the next school

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.000
 is called a Yogachara or Chitamatra or mind only.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.120
 So the next step here is worth taking this time

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.120
 because we can do a really general thing here

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.720
 and save some time if we know some certain key points.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.080
 I mean, in my view, that's my experience.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.000
 So Yogachara or mind only.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.960
 So Altrontica says all we ever experience is our projections.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.440
 It's called a representational theory of mind.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.500
 We only ever experienced a representation.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.460
 We never experienced the actual thing,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.640
 just our version of the thing.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.140
 That's all we ever experienced.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.560
 Yogachara or mind only says,

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.360
 we assume there's a thing there that's being represented.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.160
 That's not true.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.260
 There's no thing there.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:18.120
 It's all projection through and through, mind only.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.140
 There is only mental.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.960
 So there's no kind of a big problem

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.360
 of how mind and matter meet.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.680
 There's only mind.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.380
 It's all projection.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.320
 Mind only school.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.660
 I say, how could it all be mind?

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.960
 How can mind interact with mind?

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.240
 How can there be multiple minds?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.840
 'Cause we think so much were rooted

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.320
 in these tangible material things, right?

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.760
 I am.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.560
 But my thoughts influence each other all the time.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.760
 So do my emotions.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.280
 My anger leads to my hatred, leads to my jealousy,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.040
 leads to my hatred, leads to my self doubt.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.080
 This is a constant chain of mental things

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.640
 influence each other all batting around

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.000
 in the little cage up there.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.220
 Mind only school says it's only mind.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.840
 There's nothing out there, just mind.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.400
 That thing that we think is out there

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.760
 causing our projection, it's not there.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.200
 That's a mistaken belief, misapprehension.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.740
 So mind only school has three big points.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.200
 They call the three natures.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.500
 One, imaginary nature.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.560
 Two, the dependent arising nature.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.100
 Three, the truly established nature.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.920
 Imaginary nature is totally false 100%.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.320
 There's nothing that exists.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.720
 It's called, in common examples,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.100
 there's son of a barren woman, horn of a rabbit.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.220
 The other one's ego.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.440
 Ego is a completely false imaginary conception.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.400
 There's no actual referent in reality that that refers to.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.640
 It's completely false.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.680
 It's not a dream.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.000
 It's a totally wrong view.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.040
 There's no fixed entity.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.880
 The Sutra schools believe this,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.240
 and so does mind only schools.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.320
 So does Manyama school.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.320
 So does all the Bhadriyana schools, like the lineages.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:30.260
 That's imaginary.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.880
 So one, we have to remove the imaginary things.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.300
 The completely fictitious distortions we have

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.800
 that have no actual coherence

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.520
 with anything that's actually happening.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.880
 Like ego, sense of me, totally false.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.980
 The second dependent arising, okay,

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.280
 we eliminate some of that.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.180
 What is happening?

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.360
 Well, there's these things interacting with each other,

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.320
 cause and effect.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.480
 There are apparent projections,

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.480
 mental habits that are interplaying and causing results.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:09.040
 What are they happening in?

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.680
 They say it's actually like the truly established nature.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.440
 In mind only school, this is called nondual mind.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:22.400
 In the path of mind only school,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.480
 what happens is nondual mind is more fully revealed

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.140
 as our impure dependent arising nature is purified.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.120
 As our understanding of cause and effect gets more accurate

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.060
 in the kind of totally false, artificial ways

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.000
 we understand cause and effect are gradually removed,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.940
 then we get a purified experience,

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.860
 which actually just means more natural, less obscured.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.880
 And then we fully reveal the,

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.400
 we kind of have the finally established true nature.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.440
 100% unmistaken.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.340
 So they talk about this as the alaya being purified,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.080
 the ground, the swear house consciousness.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.720
 It has all these temporary delusions.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.040
 It's where all these experiences

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.400
 since infinite beginningless time

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.280
 have been stored as these habits.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.320
 Receives every single sense datum,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.960
 every percept, every concept, every perception,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.460
 every conception, inputs it there.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.840
 And then as the causes and conditions arise,

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.440
 the habits are activated.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.840
 And then our projection is colored and textured

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.160
 in certain ways based on what particular habits

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.640
 are happening right now that we actually implanted

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.340
 in our alaya consciousness a long time ago or more recently.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.920
 And gradually these distorted habits through practice,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.300
 they're not falsely reifying.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.960
 They're not falsely holding on to our experience.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.920
 These mistaken habits, the imaginary ones dissolve

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.400
 and removed, then the mistaken cause and effect,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.640
 dependent arising habits are gradually removed

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.480
 until they're gone.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.880
 And what's left is the truly established nature,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.800
 non dual mind.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.380
 That's a mind only school.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:10.620
 And then we get to the middle way view, Madhyamaka.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:20.900
 So the mind only school, or sorry, the middle way, Madhyamaka.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.820
 There's two, this is the Buddha taught

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.600
 in a Prasamparamita sutras, the Madhyamaka.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.860
 It's commonly like distilled into the heart sutra teachings.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.720
 This is second turning.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.480
 Some people call it, some great masters call it.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.320
 The second turning is a direct teaching

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.600
 of Prasamparamita of mind only.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.320
 Third turning is the hidden meaning of Prasamparamita.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.040
 Middle way view, what is the middle?

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:54.460
 Oftentimes we think of middle as our left, right, middle.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.640
 Left, right, center.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.040
 This is not the middle way.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.220
 I think it's more helpful to think of left, right,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.040
 go up a level.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.520
 So it's up leveled into unmistaken awareness.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.780
 It's called prajna.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.800
 We're not playing the games of left and right,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.220
 of binary games.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.480
 It's not in dualistic consciousness anymore.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.720
 What the middle way view is pointing out

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.000
 is unobstructed non dual wisdom awareness or prajna.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.960
 It's free from the extremes of playing all these games,

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.600
 holding onto one side against the other side.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.000
 That's what mind only, or that's what middle way view

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.600
 is trying to point us into,

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.980
 trying to pop us into our natural intelligence

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.980
 that's beyond the four extremes.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:52.760
 So their big critique of the mind only school

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.680
 is mind only school, those really kind of adherence

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.040
 to that view, they really believe in truly existent mind.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.080
 There is mind, it's happening right now.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.640
 This is all mind.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.080
 That's all there is, mind.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:10.240
 The Madhyamakans are the middle way practitioners.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.120
 There's two general types of Madhyamaka,

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.920
 the verbal aspect or scripture,

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.680
 and then the realization aspect or the meaning.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.720
 So there's all the teachings on Madhyamaka,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.060
 and then there's the actual direct experience

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.200
 of those teachings.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.660
 So there's the theory, and then there's the experience.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.200
 And mind only was taught,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.780
 or you could say popularized by Nagarjuna,

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.620
 'cause the Buddha taught mind only,

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.760
 or sorry, I keep saying mind only.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.120
 The Buddha taught the middle way view.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.640
 The Buddha taught Santantika, Vibhachika,

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.640
 mind only, middle way, all the Vajrayana.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.320
 But Nagarjuna popularized it, these middle way teachings.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.960
 And that became two streams.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:11.240
 The one stream was saying this,

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.000
 more this simple way to put it.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.040
 One, okay, so if the main point of mind only

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.400
 is to just be in a type of awareness

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.880
 that doesn't play any binary games,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.960
 totally fluid and flexible, takes no fixed position,

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.080
 non-dual wisdom awareness, the middle way.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.800
 That's what's being pointed out in the middle way teachings,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.360
 beyond conceptual designation.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.420
 There's two ways to do this.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.200
 One is we use relative stepping stones

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.440
 to gradually introduce and reintroduce this in our mind.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.720
 The other is more sudden.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.360
 It says every conceptual position is fundamentally mistaken.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.540
 Don't play the games of concepts.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.200
 Just see the true nature, absolute truth.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:10.080
 So this stepping stone approach of the middle way view,

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.400
 that is two subdivisions.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.960
 One, it says, you know, we're like people struggling here,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.740
 so like we need to use some relative truth.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.800
 You can't just refute all the relative positions

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.880
 and say they're all wrong.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.800
 Which one's better?

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.000
 Is there one that's better for a practitioner?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.040
 So there's the one that believes in the sutra school,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.640
 these irreducible particles, Sultrantika Madhyamaka.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.480
 And then there's one that uses more mind only school

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.640
 on the relative level.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.640
 That's called Yogachara Madhyamaka, our mind only middle way.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.700
 That was expounded by the great master, Shantarakshita.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.860
 I said that was taught by also Gurumache.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.520
 That was what was brought,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.440
 that's how these teachings were brought to Tibet

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.080
 in the eighth century.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.000
 Yogachara Madhyamaka.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.240
 These use relative stepping stones.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.280
 They engage what's happening on the relative phenomenal world.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.120
 What's the most helpful way according to these views?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.640
 One says irreducible particles.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.880
 There's all these tiny little bleeping things

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.840
 that are making up these big aggregate things.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.200
 The other says, actually, it's just mind.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.960
 That's the relative.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.480
 That's the best relative description

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.160
 that's most helpful to pop yourself

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.000
 out of all conceptual designation

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.820
 and recognize wisdom or awareness.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.680
 These are the gradual stepping stone approaches

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.520
 of middle way.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.060
 The more direct one called Prasangaka Madhyamaka.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.060
 And what it does is it self-destructs every position.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:40.400
 And it doesn't do that by banging it with some other,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.000
 with our usual ways of conversing now,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.320
 which is basically to like hit people with bats.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.240
 This is degenerate age.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.840
 What Prasangaka Madhyamaka uses,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.920
 use the own logic of each position.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.000
 And if you keep using their logic,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.560
 eventually you get to a self-contradiction.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.160
 Reductio ad absurdum.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.400
 Every single relative position has that.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.860
 Every single one.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.880
 So, Nagarjan is famous for this tetralemma

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.000
 that undoes the four extremes.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.120
 The extreme of this is, or this is not.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.280
 This both is and is not.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.400
 This neither is nor is not.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.760
 In logic terms, a, negation of a.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.360
 Both a and negation of a.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.680
 Neither negation, neither a and negation of a.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.280
 So these are the four logical positions

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.400
 that it covers exhaustively all relative positions possible.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.260
 And Nagarjan taught, this is, they're all,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.440
 they all are limited, they're all diluted.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.980
 They're all fundamentally self-contradictory.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.040
 There's a thing, there's not the thing.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.560
 There's both a thing and not the thing.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.380
 There's neither thing nor not the thing.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.960
 They're all self-contradictory.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.420
 So when Nagarjan is fundamental wisdom of the middle way,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.620
 amongst other teachings, he refuted these thoroughly.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.980
 Why did he do that?

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.640
 He said, don't play games

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.300
 with conceptual relative designation.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.120
 They're all fundamentally flawed.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.180
 Just recognize absolute truth.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.720
 Be in the realized meaning of Madhyamaka.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.960
 Don't just play word games.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.680
 Don't just gradually use kind of distorted ideas

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.760
 and less distorted until it's not distorted.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.760
 Just go right to undistorted, non-deceptive, absolute truth.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.840
 Don't play with fabrication, relative truth,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.240
 fabricated artificial reality.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.240
 Just ignite, turn on right now, wisdom awareness.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.280
 That's called absolute bodhichitta.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.160
 Just turn it on now.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.880
 Don't play all these gradual games.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.000
 There's too many beings suffering.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.220
 They need our help too much.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.400
 Just wake up.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.480
 Right?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.120
 Zen likes this approach.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.960
 Stick.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.120
 Just come out.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.040
 Wake up.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.800
 But then they use all these rituals and stepping stones

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.720
 and you walk this way and clean the bowl this way

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.560
 and all that.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.040
 That's all Svaatranthakam and Yamaka.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.160
 There's all kinds of conceptual supports.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.280
 So this is how, this comes down to the middle way view.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:27.920
 Say in one way, when Yamaka is,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.240
 if we're just looking at refuting inherent existence,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.080
 there's no fixed identity, that's conceptual.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.680
 'Cause we're still using concepts to realize that.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.640
 But then the direct meaning of Madhyamaka

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.680
 is being in non-conceptual wisdom awareness or prajna,

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.500
 not falling for any of these games.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.720
 Basically a way to say this is,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.080
 don't take any relative position as if it's absolutely true.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.540
 Because all relative positions are absolutely false.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.440
 They are all distorted.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.060
 The Buddha taught this so clearly.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.440
 Conceptual mind is fundamentally distorted.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.780
 The prayer of kunden sampo,

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.080
 that's the big demon in Buddhism, conceptualization.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.640
 We can use concepts to get into un-conceptual

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.880
 or non-conceptual meditation.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.080
 That's the stepping stone middle way approach.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.580
 Or we can just directly try to recognize

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.120
 non-dual wisdom awareness.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.280
 That's the Prasangaka Madhyamaka approach.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.640
 That's Rangthong, empty of other, or sorry,

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.360
 empty of self, empty of self-identity.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.840
 The great master, Kembo Sultram Jamsaramichhe says,

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.520
 Prasangaka Madhyamaka is the ultimate highest view,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.880
 philosophically, because all relative positions

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.640
 are fundamentally erroneous.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.920
 If you try to establish any relative position,

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.360
 it will be mistaken.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.800
 So don't establish a relative position.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.700
 Abide in ultimate truth.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.480
 They don't affirm anything.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.540
 They just establish that relative positions

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.440
 are fundamentally limited.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.760
 So don't play with limited duality mind.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.160
 Recognize unlimited duality,

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.320
 unlimited non-dual wisdom awareness.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.680
 Then this same great master,

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.720
 Rangthong Kembo Sultram Jamsaramichhe said,

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.380
 third turning shentong approach is the best technique

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.720
 if you're actually gonna apply it in practice.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.520
 Say, what is it like when you're abiding in emptiness?

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.340
 All these amazing qualities come up.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:38.160
 The 10 powers and all the fearlessnesses and omnisciences

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.540
 and all these clairs, the clairvoyances

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.440
 and clairaudience and clairvisual

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.760
 and all these things start happening

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.840
 'cause now the alaya is being purified

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.680
 and what was previously blocked is unblocked

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.520
 and that arises as cities.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.560
 And this is just said to be the natural state

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.840
 of how mind is when it's not all gunked up

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.120
 with habitual patterns.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.080
 That's why it's a definitive,

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.740
 the definitive teaching is both Rangthong and shentong.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.200
 Conceptually, Prasangaka is the best one

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.200
 to get us out of conceptual grasping, our hang ups,

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.760
 holding on to this conceptual playground,

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.420
 things that we like, our boxes, you know?

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.240
 Prasangaka really shows that all these boxes are limited.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.960
 Shentong says, what's it like if we're out of the box?

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.940
 No box.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.300
 What's it like?

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.560
 What's the experience like?

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.740
 That's why for meditators,

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.000
 shentong is said to be definitive.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.300
 And then both, we need both, study and practice.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.520
 So when it comes to it,

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.520
 the absolute truth is not that there's no box.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.120
 It's not that there's no self.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.700
 It's not that there's no position.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.020
 It's that all positions on the ultimate level,

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.440
 absolutely speaking, all positions

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.140
 are fundamentally flexible.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:04.840
 Their nature is emptiness.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.280
 So, Middleweight View uses what's called transcendental logic

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.280
 to reveal the ultimate open, flexible, empty nature

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.880
 of every single relative experience.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.680
 It doesn't turn the dream off.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.080
 It wakes us up.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.080
 It makes us lucid so we can navigate the dream

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.580
 to make it a better dream for all beings.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.920
 All dream-like beings make it a good dream for all of us.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.580
 The dream will never end.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.380
 We'll never not be in a box.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.760
 But what we can be in is wisdom awareness

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.180
 and then it's pure arising display,

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.980
 which is called pure relative truth.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.620
 This is where the tantras begin.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:49:00.360
 So these four philosophical schools

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.080
 by Vashika, Sravtantika, Mayandoni, Madhyamika,

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.300
 these are all sutra.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.560
 That's the basis of tantra.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.600
 That's why the Middleweight View of Madhyamika View,

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.720
 the great Madhyamika View is non-dual wisdom awareness

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.320
 or prajna, wisdom inseparable with compassion.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.520
 That's how this is the foundation of tantra.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.420
 The Middleweight View leans into tantra.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.000
 It's geared forward to tantra practice.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.120
 That's what we're doing at the beginning of every session.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.040
 That's what we're trying to reintroduce

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.680
 in our sadhana practice to ourselves

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.040
 to abide in the Middleweight View.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.920
 That's when dissolution happens.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.240
 That's called the Middleweight View, great Madhyamika.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.160
 It could be called zogchen, mahamudra,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.840
 prajna, paramitta, shije, chud, lamdre.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.720
 Ramachas have gone over this so many times.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.040
 This is just the Buddha nature happening unobstructedly.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.580
 So in the sutras, that's how they talk about it in the sutras,

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.320
 unobstructed Buddha nature.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.240
 In the tantras, they talk about it as rigpa.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.600
 Or ordinary mind.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.840
 How the mind is when it's not funneled

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.280
 through all these concepts.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.920
 And then a key point here is it's not dumbing down

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.080
 the mind becoming pre-conceptual.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.820
 We're not trying to be like cows.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:24.240
 Post-conceptual, we're trying to use concepts when necessary

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.480
 to skillfully communicate with others.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.480
 But to see, that's just one way of communicating.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.520
 There's all these other ways of communicating

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.360
 that the Buddha pointed towards post-conceptual,

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:42.240
 non-conceptual, wisdom awareness.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.840
 That's what the middle way view is pointing towards.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.460
 They do that by not establishing any fixed relative position.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.560
 They let every relative position undo itself.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.080
 And what's left isn't a smoldering wasteland

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.540
 of extreme relativism.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.100
 What's left is non-dual wisdom awareness.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.240
 Wisdom, that's how Buddhism is very different

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.480
 than deconstructionism.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.200
 In the end, what's left when you see

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.200
 that everything's relative, wisdom's left.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.600
 That's why they say Buddhas don't have consciousness.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.000
 They only have wisdom.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.560
 That's why I talk about the five wisdoms.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.880
 Buddhas don't have conceptual mind.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.180
 They can see the baby nightmares that we play with concepts.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.920
 Oh, I like this way and that way,

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.600
 and I have all these narratives and designations

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.320
 and preferences and colors and fashions and fads and stuff.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.340
 They see how all those baby activities we're doing.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.660
 So sad, we've done it forever.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.760
 We're gonna keep doing it forever,

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.960
 unless we stop doing it.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.840
 It's sad.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.080
 The Buddhists see that, so there's such compassion.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.680
 Then they give us all these stepping stones

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.080
 to just finally just to set down the burden, you know?

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.640
 Just like relax the mind.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.800
 Let it just be what it naturally is

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.400
 with always kind of always in its own story, you know?

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.560
 So we can see how typical, mundane, common sense,

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.420
 contemporary discussions on almost everything

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.440
 is a lot more superficial than this.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.320
 Buddhism's not throwing that out.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.240
 Buddhism meets all of us where we are.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.960
 If we're really upset about the color of our car

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.860
 or, you know, whatever, someone called us a name,

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.960
 the Buddha will approach that.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.360
 It's called a no analysis.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.760
 Oh, your car's red, not brown, sorry, you know?

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.800
 Genuinely, the Buddha will genuinely experience

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.960
 that with compassion, not with condemnation

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.480
 or not kind of some I'm better than you approach.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:54.060
 The middle way view meets beings exactly where they are

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.800
 in their dream and just helps it.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.380
 It's just a dream, you know?

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.440
 You can wake up a little more.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.480
 And when we wake up, the dream doesn't stop.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.080
 We become lucid in the dream.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:08.800
 Then it's not a big problem anymore.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.280
 So that's the big fundamental insight

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.440
 of the mind only, or sorry, the middle way view.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.440
 All of samsara's a false problem.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.440
 There's no samsara.

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.240
 There's no nirvana.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.400
 There's no path.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.340
 There's no freedom.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.840
 You can't be free if you were never trapped.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.040
 The true nature was never trapped.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.840
 It was always free.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.740
 Called great freedom, tempo, great perfection,

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.120
 great completion.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.020
 We just have to recognize what we already are,

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.680
 wisdom and compassion in union.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.200
 That's the path of Buddha.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.160
 That's the path the Buddha taught.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.520
 And the most direct path is just to relax and see it

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.440
 and be it.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.240
 And when we don't see that,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.560
 then we need stepping stones.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.400
 We need tools to re-recognize.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.960
 And there's all these teachings

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.920
 and all these paths and philosophical schools

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.080
 and yanas to use.

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.120
 When we let that true nature happen

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.680
 and our alia or our mind,

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.560
 the subtle storehouse consciousness is groundless.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.300
 The groundless ground, right?

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:18.720
 Empty of intrinsic existence.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.320
 That doesn't have that quality.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.000
 Talked about as if it's a base, Z.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.780
 The base of all.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.120
 Ground manyamaka, the union of two truths.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.060
 Path manyamaka, the union of the two merits.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.040
 Permission manyamaka, the final total perfection

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.840
 of the two bodies of rupakaya, form and formless bodies.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.800
 That's the full expression of the mind only,

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.440
 or sorry, the middle way view.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.640
 The groundless ground.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.680
 How's it recognized? By awareness.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.820
 Undistorted, pristine, valid cognition.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.520
 What does relative truth do

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.000
 once we start abiding in the groundless ground?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.960
 We start seeing things more purely.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.860
 That's when the tantras start.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:05.720
 All the skillful means of the tantras

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.120
 start using kind of our pure natural qualities.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.880
 It start pouring out.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.500
 And we use them, it's so skillful.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.100
 You use conceptual pretending.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.440
 I look like this, the guru's up there.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.740
 It embodies all these things.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.600
 It comes from, you know, we go into the creation

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.760
 and then it happens and the completion and it dissolves.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.500
 It uses our conceptual designation

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.880
 if we're not experiencing that yet,

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.080
 we're not on the boomies.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.480
 But it uses it to undo itself.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.480
 It uses our imagination to undo our conceptual fixation.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.240
 We're practicing being free.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.120
 And then we dissolve and we just let ourselves be free.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.160
 So it's so skillful like that.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.520
 And then the final Yana, the Zogchen approach,

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.000
 Ata Yoga Yana, is not pretending anything.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.380
 It's not playing any conceptual games anymore.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:01.380
 It's letting the pure relative truth be what it is fully.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.920
 It's letting the great equality, the absolute truth

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.140
 be what it is fully.

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.200
 And don't do anything, undistracted, nonmeditation.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.960
 Recognize your own innate wisdom awareness,

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.040
 the groundless ground.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.280
 And all these habits and things will come up

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.340
 and just let them come, let them go.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:24.000
 Then there's all these teachings on that.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.160
 And we need the teachers to keep showing us

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.520
 because we keep believing in the most obvious things

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.800
 like my name's Drakpa, you know.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.500
 There's a me here.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.980
 Oh, so, you know, birth, old age, sickness, and death.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.080
 I really believe in all that.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.880
 I have a lot of suffering around that.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.220
 So we have to be kind to ourselves

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.400
 and go through this path gradually.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.780
 But we can't fake ourselves out

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.240
 and act like we're being big middle way view people

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.080
 if we can't even talk about what does the middle way mean.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.900
 Non-dual wisdom doesn't mean no concepts.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.120
 It means isn't addicted to concepts.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.200
 A great, great master abiding in non-dual wisdom awareness

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.880
 should be able to explain how reality functions

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.760
 so clearly with such elaboration.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.520
 The Buddha taught so many teachings.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.700
 It didn't shut off his ability to talk.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.180
 The Buddha was fully engaged. He just wasn't addicted to it.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.200
 He wasn't stuck on one version of a dream

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.400
 and then just like hammering everyone with that version.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.580
 Like we always do.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.800
 I do. I'm right. You're wrong.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.360
 Right?

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.640
 That's why.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.360
 Woo, dah, dah, dah.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.880
 Now I get to say the big trigger word,

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.920
 which I thought to throw in

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.480
 after all this kind of illogical things

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.980
 and all this really traditional Buddhist Dharma.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.280
 This is the exact same as integral approach.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:51.040
 Everything I just went through

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:56.040
 proves that Nainayana system's integral post-postmodern.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.860
 It's a worldview.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.120
 It's not a historical epic

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.080
 or just people who are dead and gone, you know?

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.760
 This is a traditional Buddhist way to explain that worldview.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.260
 The worldview that goes past of I'm right and you're wrong.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.040
 That's called a middle way view.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.800
 It doesn't actually hold onto a fixed relative position

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.840
 as if it's truly fixed.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.920
 Oh, that's that way. Okay.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.000
 I'll meet you where you're at.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.560
 How can I help from there?

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.560
 Every other worldview doesn't do that.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.800
 They all believe they're right

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.060
 and the other people are wrong.

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.900
 Look.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.880
 Look at it.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.660
 I challenge everyone.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.540
 Pre-integral worldviews.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.640
 This isn't an elitist thing.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.280
 It's not like Ata Yoga is the only good one

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.520
 and all these other yanas are bad.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.520
 That's not saying anything like that.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.320
 Pre-integral worldviews,

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.440
 the fundamental belief that they all have,

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.920
 I'm right, everyone else is wrong.

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.160
 It's part of the operating system.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.480
 The integral worldview is the only one that stops doing that.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.240
 And then after that, it doesn't make that mistake again.

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.980
 Middleweight view is the only Buddhist view

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.800
 that goes beyond fixating on relative views.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.960
 And it just works with other people's positions,

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.440
 whatever's helpful to them.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:24.420
 This is the same middleweight view.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.320
 Integral worldview is the exact same.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.180
 Theory is a different thing.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.520
 Middleweight has theory, it has experience.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.440
 Every worldview has the theory, theoretical map.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.240
 Then it has the actual experience.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:43.040
 But you can't be a Bodhisattva really seriously

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.280
 and think you're right and everyone's wrong.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.540
 That's impossible.

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.640
 It doesn't fit.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.320
 'Cause Bodhisattva approach

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.400
 fundamentally believes in the middleweight view.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.160
 Prajna is the only actual answer

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.880
 because every other answer really believes it's right

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.080
 and all the other ones are wrong.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.440
 So that's my challenge.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.000
 If we're really serious about being Bodhisattvas,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.280
 we really have to upend our view

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.840
 that I'm right and you're wrong.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.900
 It's not good enough to just do longer treat

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.380
 or say some prayers a little bit

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.400
 and then come out and use our Buddhist jargon

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.220
 and hang out with our Buddhist friends and all that.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.000
 The world needs more than that from us.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.360
 We're talking about things beyond self, beyond other,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.000
 beyond this ism and that ism

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.440
 and this tradition and that tradition.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.360
 Buddhism needs a lot more flexible beings

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.440
 and the middleweight view is that flexible approach.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.760
 That's essentially the Buddhist teaching.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.240
 If we're not doing middleweight view

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.240
 and we think we're doing all this Vajrayana

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.160
 Tibetan Buddhism, we're really not.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.040
 We're fooling ourselves.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.440
 If we do a lot of Tibetan Buddhist practice in the end,

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.480
 it doesn't really help much.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.240
 We're not doing it right.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.640
 I know, I've not done it right for a long time.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.160
 It's a challenge not just as I'm right and you're wrong.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.520
 It's, are we really in a state of mind

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.540
 that actually is so caring about others' positions

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.800
 that we'll like see how they are right too.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.840
 But it doesn't mean they're the right in the same way.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.260
 Prasankaka Madhyamaka on relative conventional truth

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.680
 still has a spectrum of mistaken conceptual truth,

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.300
 conventional truth, and unmistaken.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.280
 They still make all these designations

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.420
 on the relative truth.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.160
 It's not just all relative, anything goes.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.280
 It's so refined, the view.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.340
 They just think that's all fictitious.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:50.120
 It's all fake, but there's some that are more accurate fake.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.600
 Some are more helpful.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.520
 There's some are more helpful Cinderella stories

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.440
 as Sogsar Kentsen Rinpoche says.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.600
 But they're all provisional.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.680
 So that's my long winded thing.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.800
 And I meant this to be a little longer.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.600
 I mean, I can't possibly like go talk about middleweight view

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.000
 and not go through to all the other philosophical schools

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.760
 and locate it within the Nanyana system.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.720
 It's not true, you know, it's easy to say it's all space,

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.960
 you know, but so what, easy breezy, you know.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.180
 Words are so easy, but when the challenge happens,

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.600
 if we're not really actually coming from a place of wisdom,

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.960
 we just collapse into our most convenient

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.620
 habitual conceptualization.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.360
 And we lock up, and we freeze, and we fight.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.680
 That's called samsara.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.520
 It's not enough anymore for 21st century Buddhas

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.640
 to just use nice, funny words,

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.520
 and then we just don't really do practice,

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.680
 or we do some practice, but we just do it in a way

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.060
 that's not really curious,

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.520
 it's not really trying to undo itself,

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.360
 it's just trying to get in the time.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.080
 And then 20 years goes by, and then we say,

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.720
 oh, I'm not really better or something,

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.080
 the Buddhas is wrong, and Dharma is wrong,

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.480
 then we blame, blame, blame, blame,

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.980
 and Benhamdha Kamuramichi has talked about this a lot.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.800
 We're trying to use this time to,

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.740
 this is really preventative medicine.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.840
 We need to know some of these key points.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.740
 We need to know how mind-only school is based on

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.560
 Swatranthaka, is based on Vibhachaka,

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.560
 and it leads to middle way, which leads to Vatriyana,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.360
 which leads to Dzogchen, which goes beyond all isms.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.220
 It's not about any system, it's just about naturalness.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.640
 But we need to clearly see with mindfulness

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.720
 how we're not doing that, and we need to be kind to ourself

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.600
 to see how we're not doing that, not to say, I'm perfect.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.800
 See how I keep messing up, if I'm not willing to look

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.760
 at my unconscious habits, or not to ask for help,

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.440
 then they're just gonna keep being the background radiation,

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.400
 the operating system I just don't see,

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.940
 but usually everyone else sees, and it's just forever,

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.240
 and we're gonna do this samsara thing forever.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.580
 But without mind-only school, Vatriyana's a joke.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.680
 We're gonna transform all this into a mandala

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.760
 that makes no sense if there's actual

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.000
 physical things out there.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.480
 If we're gonna go into all this, everything arises,

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.080
 there's a hyung, so there's a syllable,

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.680
 which becomes a ornament, like a certain hand object,

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.480
 which becomes a deity, which becomes a retinue,

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.240
 which does all these activities, and eneminate,

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.720
 and gather, and dissolve, and then receive blessing,

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.540
 and then open awareness.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.820
 We're gonna talk about doing all that.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.360
 How could a fixed position be true,

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.440
 and have that practice make any sense?

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.040
 It doesn't make any sense.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.160
 I mean, it's the only way to really be in a state

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.520
 of mind that doesn't fixate.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.920
 That's what we're practicing, how to not fixate,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920
 how to be present and engaged with appearance

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.880
 that's totally flexible, empty of being fixated,

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.020
 not really a non-reified experience.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.600
 That's the only way to freedom.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.020
 This is the only way we can really be of benefit to others,

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.160
 is really see how we keep trapping ourselves,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.160
 and actually put the time in to unlock our own blockages.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.000
 No one can do it for us.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.240
 We have everything we need to do this now,

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.080
 but it takes time to digest it,

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.720
 and it takes time to chew on it,

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.240
 and it takes time to engage it,

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
 and it takes vulnerability and honesty to say

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.920
 when I don't know what's going on,

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.480
 and I need help, and to try to be vulnerable and receive help,

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.280
 and to recognize some people are way farther along the path,

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.220
 and to use their guidance, and to try our best,

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.740
 and then we mess up, and then we try, try again.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:09.080
 And at the end of that, we're gonna be free,

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:14.580
 and then we can really help beings, really help beings.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.860
 Exactly how it makes sense to them,

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.420
 not how we think they need to be helped,

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.820
 but really on their own side,

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.960
 what makes them a little more open?

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.820
 We need the flexibility to see the real nuggets of truth

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.920
 in all of these positions,

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.740
 and at the same time see how they're all limited,

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.580
 they're all partial.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.120
 Everything's partially true on the relative level.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.480
 It's partially false.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.340
 So this wisdom awareness of prajna,

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.220
 the only way to be that flexible,

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.980
 that's the only way we can be flexible enough.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.800
 Then when we're that flexible,

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.980
 we really can engage partial positions

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.440
 with a lot of love and tenderness and care and respect.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:08.880
 Otherwise we're doing this Vajrayana thing for ourselves,

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.920
 it's a disaster.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.940
 I'm doing Vajrayana so I can get free.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.660
 Good luck.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.580
 Doesn't work like that.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.900
 All the philosophical schools

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.480
 already refuted the existence of itself.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.100
 We can't use all these high-end Buddhist teachings

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.580
 and use them from a non-Buddhist world view,

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.980
 believing in all these fixed entities.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.940
 This doesn't work, it won't work,

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.860
 like Zog sarkhan Sarimache also says.

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.180
 If you really want to use Buddhism to just be happy

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.580
 and free-flowing and stuff, just get a massage.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.540
 It makes more sense.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:54.300
 We're doing it to be free, not to be happy.

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.620
 Then it comes in, the great blissfulness

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.340
 and nature's already great bliss.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.260
 So then it's like way past happiness.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.300
 But we actually have to be in that

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:06.700
 and not just talk about that.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:11.820
 So that's my kind of going through the whirlwind

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.100
 of all the Nanyanas in the four philosophical schools

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.100
 to try to more firmly or clearly establish

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.540
 what a middle-wave view might look like,

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.860
 what it might be pointing towards.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.700
 So this is all just moon pointing.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.780
 And now we'll just kind of like use that moon pointing

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.140
 to just relax in our practice.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.200
 So thanks so much.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.660
 Thanks to your patience for a little bit

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:38.080
 of a kind of longer talk, but I appreciate you.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.060
 Thank you.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:39.900
 Thank you all.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.100
 Thank you, friends.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:09:04.780
 Thank you.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.100
 Thank you.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.660
 Thank you.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.140
 Thank you.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.820
 It's such a pleasure to be here with you all.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.720
 And yeah, we all have everything in our favor now.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.300
 Beautiful human beings, beautiful opportunity,

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.860
 beautiful teachings, beautiful teacher,

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.580
 beautiful path, beautiful sangha.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.860
 We really have everything.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:31.020
 It's all laid out for us.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.620
 And so we just, wherever we are, that's where we start.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.220
 That's where we continue.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.820
 And we just keep relaxing, keep resting,

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.860
 keep engaging with a really joyful heart,

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.580
 with really good intention.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.280
 Give others the benefit of the doubt.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.380
 Try to see their good, their really goodness first.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:55.420
 Then we can have a discussion about kind of finer points

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.500
 that are harder to figure out, a little more complicated.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.780
 But like try to really start with really,

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.320
 oh, you're a good being.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.900
 I'm a good being, you're a good being.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.820
 I'm like, we really are in this together.

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.300
 We need to work together with that.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.020
 And we need to be really kind of discerning

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:16.320
 about what we're bringing to the conversation,

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.020
 about what my mind's doing,

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.420
 what my habits are doing to me,

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.940
 how they're helping me, how they're hurting me,

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.580
 how they're helping and hurting others too.

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.020
 So that's just being a responsible practitioner

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020
 of the Buddha Dharma.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.740
 And then this summary,

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.220
 I thought to give a quick summary,

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.860
 to just tie it all together,

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:38.180
 which is a very succinct first point.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.940
 Everything is impermanent.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:47.020
 All boils down to these tiny irreducible particles

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.600
 of space, time and mind.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.220
 That's by Bhashika.

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:56.760
 All we ever experience is our projection.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.180
 That is Sultantika.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.760
 There is only projection.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.760
 That's mind only.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:17.900
 Some projections are really convenient useful placeholders

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.900
 to recognizing what is beyond projection,

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.460
 what is not filtered through

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.080
 fundamentally deceptive projection.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:36.320
 That's called Categorized Middleweight View.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:44.500
 All projections are fundamentally distorted and diluted.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.780
 So just jump into what is fundamentally undistorted

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.500
 and not diluted.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.300
 Pristine Wisdom Awareness, Prashna.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:59.740
 It's called uncategorized Middleweight View, Prasangika.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:06.660
 When we abide in pristine valid cognition

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.780
 of the noble ones, then we use skillful means

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:17.300
 to gradually refine our perceptions

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.200
 and habits of body and speech.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.900
 This is Outer Tantras.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:31.920
 Outside in body, everything we see form, sound, space,

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.180
 there is nothing impure.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.660
 It's all deities doing Dharma activities,

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.100
 enlightened activities in a mandala, Maha Yoga.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:51.220
 Everything inside is just the activities of deities

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.420
 in the mandalas which fundamentally make up

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.780
 our Vajrabhadi, Salong Tigle, Anu Yoga.

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:04.780
 Everything outside, inside, conceptual mind,

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.220
 non-conceptual wisdom, has always only ever been

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.360
 pristine, valid cognition.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.800
 It will never be stained.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.740
 It has never been broken.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.920
 It will always be 100% perfect and pure.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.300
 This is Ahti Yoga, Sogchen.

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:29.460
 Then when it comes down to it, Venerable Kenshin,

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.340
 Paul Dinscher, Barimba Che said in his glorious book,

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.880
 The Nine Golden Chariots,

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.080
 the closer we look at relative truth,

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.240
 the more uncertain we become.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.100
 'Cause relative truth is fabricated

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.720
 and fundamentally diluted.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:57.780
 The closer we look at absolute ultimate truth,

01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.020
 the more certain we become.

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.720
 Because Prajna is unmistaked, unmistaken.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.880
 Perfect, pristine, valid cognition.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:18.620
 Thank you, friends.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.460
 Thank you.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.480
 We can do it.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.600
 Yay, team.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.040
 Bye.
