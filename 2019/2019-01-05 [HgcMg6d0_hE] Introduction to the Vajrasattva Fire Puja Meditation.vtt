00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 "Reminded that we are doing this beautiful ceremony. This morning we are going to do a practice on

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 the Bhagavad-yasattva with the fire puja that is a symbol of the world used in India, the fire

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 world, but in Tibet, of the fire offering. But in Tibet it is called Gymsi. It is not just a fire

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 offering, it is a very special ceremony known as Gymsi practices."

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.690
 According to the teaching, Gymsi ceremony is very powerful. It is connected to the four different

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.930
 activities of the buddhas. Those are known as pacifying activities and as well as increasing

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.500
 activities and overpowering activities and subjugating activities.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.910
 So, this particularly what we are going to do, Vajrasattva practices, is pacifying. What we are pac

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.030
ifying, the all undesirable situations and circumstances that we are pacifying, disease, sicknesses,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:19.500
 violence, negativities, negative energies and obscurations, obstacles and unbalanced situations of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 the elements,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.030
 of the environment. Everything that we are disturbing and undesirable systems to ourselves, to the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:36.620
 beings, we are pacifying. Why I am saying that? Because we are doing this practice not just only

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 for us.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 That was we are following the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching. According to Mahayana

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.500
, we are expanding our love and compassion and concerning caring thought for all living beings.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.820
 And that's why we are doing this practice for every living beings, everyone. Those who are here and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.810
 those who are gone on our side, or those who are having difficulty troubles and sicknesses, or

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.500
 those who are again in the Buddha teaching said, six different realms have different kind of like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 the troubles and difficulties.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.420
 In human realm, those are known as birth, getting old, sickness and death are the kind of principle

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 highlighted difficulty.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.540
 So, we are doing this practice so everyone has peace and happiness and joy, simple something that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.500
 can move easily with courage and confidence and destination for attitudes.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.970
 That's why we are doing this. Therefore, expand our body to every living beings and then we do

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.500
 these practices.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.860
 Also, we are doing these practices to offer to all those higher beings, the greatest teachers,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.520
 greatest masters who are in still life and we really wish their long life and good health and joy

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.500
 and fulfillment.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.950
 Not just I mean the master of Buddhism, but generally all the peacemakers involved, who are making

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.030
 peace and harmony, some good things for mankind, all the living beings really wish everyone

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.500
 performed beautifully something.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.690
 And those who passed in those great beings, we also make these offerings and ceremony to kind of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.500
 smooth the transition of the higher realization status.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.910
 At the same time, we are doing this ceremony to fulfill all their supreme aspirations that they can

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.200
 fulfill without any difficulty and return back immediately emanations to help to benefit the beings

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.500
.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.640
 So, this is multiple purposes. We are doing this ceremony with the Vedasattvas. Vedasattva is one

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.850
 of the very powerful videos that which in the Buddha teaching from all the Vedayana teaching has

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.500
 Vedasattva practices.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:03.720
 Every sattva we chant and pray that always connected with the Vedasattva. Therefore, Vedasattva is

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.500
 known as the one great Buddha that encompasses all the mandalas.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.520
 So, it is very special practice and then it is up and we practice Vedakalayas, which is according

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:25.490
 to the teaching, it is a wrathful aspect of the Buddha Vedasattvas, wrath to the ego-clinging,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.500
 wrath to the negative it is to destroy.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.580
 It is not something wrath to destroy, to destroy the good things, but wrath to the negativity, ego-

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.500
clinging, self-important, self-centered mind, obstacles, diseases, sicknesses.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.600
 That is the one practice of Vedakalayas and Vedakalayas is considered one of the very powerful

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.500
 practices.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.100
 Even in the GURUPE MASSAMBA, who is totally enlightened beings, according to the relative level, he

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.500
 practices Vedakalayas to subdue the negatives and to dispel the old obstacles.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.590
 So, therefore, in one way Vedakalayas practice is a personal practice of the GURUPE MASSAMBA, a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.460
 personal practice of the Yihi Thoja, a personal practice of all those great beings, great masters,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.500
 great takings,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.490
 great takings. Today we are connected with that and we can also feel great joy in the application

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.500
 that we have such a beautiful connection,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.630
 we have good opportunity, this golden, like chain of the golden lineage, this stainless teaching

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.500
 that we are really connected to all of us.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.930
 It's not just so coincidental, truly it is your connected practices, your practice, your connected,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.500
 we are all connected.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.300
 And how wonderful, how beautiful, being more great, joy in the appreciation, graceful, joy in the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.500
 appreciation, together we devote each other and together with the devotions.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.200
 And we keep all those beautiful qualities, then truly we are moving so beautifully, so smoothly to

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.500
 the destination where all these enlightened beings are living and enjoying themselves.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.450
 So that's really pleased, everybody will really extend the bodhicitta, and that is all it is oscill

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.500
ated and mostly we count it in the way of the English, so you will know that.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:27.320
 And connecting this world to the heart, and this is the meditation. We think meditation is only a

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.500
 kind of silence, that is meditation too.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.540
 But this is very high form of meditation, in Vedayana teaching, that you heard, visualization and

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.500
 the completion stages.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 Generally both are inseparable, so we practice both inseparable.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 When we do the silent meditation, we just only focus on absolute levels, all kamathas.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.610
 This time we are union of the kamata and vipahana, all these are key meditations, so it is like

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.500
 everything brings us to the mandalas.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.620
 Without there nothing to sort out, nothing to reject, nothing to avoid, all is one great mandala

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.500
 status.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.860
 That's what really this visualization practice, that's what Vedayana practice is very special,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.710
 powerful in it always, in those great mountains it is special, powerful because there is nothing we

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.500
 are living that is something impure or bad.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:33.830
 The universe is pure, our self is pure, our mind is pure, and we are in that pure status, and

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.570
 performing this all activities such as pacifying, subjugation or whatever activity we perform with

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.500
 this ceremony, so it is very special.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.110
 So those are just again a general reminder to all of us, and now we begin to feel strongly

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.500
 connected again to the lineage.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.070
 This is the lineage teaching of the Murapai Masambhava or the Buddha Murapai Masambhava, 3D-filled

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.500
 stone prison in Murapai Masambhava.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.480
 You know all the Buddha's Murapai Masambhava is in holy manner, all the lineage masters in one

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:15.590
 single state feel strong, feel full of joy and appreciation, being graceful, and bodhicitta and

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:22.500
 devotion, and just seedling those qualities, and then we begin this practice.
