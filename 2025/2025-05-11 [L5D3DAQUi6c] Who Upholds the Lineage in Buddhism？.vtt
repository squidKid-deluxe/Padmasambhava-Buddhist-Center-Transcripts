Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 12\nMay 9, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 And we all heard that so many times, we're going to restant in our beautiful motivation

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 and in joy and appreciation and thankful, grateful, and to the all, to the great teacher of Buddha

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.240
 Hehkamuni. From that on, onward, until now, all the lineage masters, lineage practitioners,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.440
 who kept up these practices and teachings, and not just Buddha taught 600 years ago,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.620
 and then it's continuing now. Until now, this was made by all the lineage masters, the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.000
 practitioners.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 As the teachings said, we pray. The one who holds the teachings, they stay a long time.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 One who spreads out the teachings, only in the whole universe or the world, they stay

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.760
 and, again, as we join the prayer, I don't really know how to translate it, that in English,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.960
 but temple, pajora, lama, shapiti, tindhi, kiwu, satin, yawma, shapsi. That's all the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.000
 practitioners made the spread out throughout the world. But who is really keeping up that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.680
 teaching? It's the practitioners. All the practitioners, such like you and me, we all

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.400
 practice them. That's what the dharmas are keeping up. And that is known as the holder

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 of the teachings. The holder of the teaching is not just one individually person, that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.480
 is named as holder. That may be. But holder of the teaching is a Sangha member. That's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.000
 why Sangha members are so precious. Precious Sanghas. Precious Buddha taught the teaching.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.840
 Precious Dharma is here because of the Sangha member, a devoted practitioner. They are the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.640
 holder of the teachings. So they keep this teaching and we got this now. We are connected

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.760
 to that. Therefore, thankful, joyful, happy, joy, and appreciative. We are part of that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 golden chain and always in the teachings, stainless golden chain, that continually carried. Also,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 the natural like teaching, the distilled natural like teachings, that gracious teacher,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.840
 Buddha Shaktamani shared, and continually carried that without dilute it, dilute it,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.640
 and without mixed up. They kept that with honor, with respect, courage, and a commitment.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.160
 And observe that with each of their own heart, and also share that with others in that context.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.800
 Therefore, lineage teaching is known as natural like teachings. Chain of the stainless golden

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.720
 teachings. Today, we are all connected to that great teaching, that great lineage. Not just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.640
 connected, we are upholding that according to our best capabilities. Therefore, grateful,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.560
 happy, and joyful. At the same time, may I be able to hold this teaching by the practice,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 meditation, and studying, contemplating, until I reach the enlightenment in order to benefit

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.880
 for all living beings, having those attitude in the heart and the mind with full joy. That is,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.160
 in the teaching, said great offerings, great military activities. Gracious teacher,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.440
 Buddha Shaktamani, and Gurbam are some of all the lineage masters in their environment. For them,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 the entire universe is wealth. They don't need wealth. They don't need material works, material

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.240
 wealth. But one who holds the teaching, that which is to gain of their interest, gain of their

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.400
 teaching. Which is, because this teaching, again, great master Shanti Deva said, that we join,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.880
 souls of every joy. And medicine that was dispelled, one medicine dispelled or dispelled,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.840
 all the suffering, sadness, and souls by every joy is the teaching. That is not just a bragging,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:37.280
 arrogantly making statement. What is really teaching? Teaching is nothing but 100 percent

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:45.120
 loving kindness, 100 percent compassion, 100 percent how to benefit, help to everyone,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:54.560
 bring joy, peace, and calmness now, and continue to last forever. For that's why we joined,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.920
 breathe, such as, may all living beings have preformed suffering. But then we not just say

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:12.000
 suffering, cause of sufferings, broad mind, very strong statement, not just a temporary solution.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.960
 The permanent solution for all living beings, preformed sufferings, cause of sufferings,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.320
 may they all have the joy and happiness, and also cause of happiness, the joy.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.360
 Those, that's the teaching. And that is the source of every joy

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:45.200
 for all living beings without any discriminations. Not saying we are high and you are for us.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.120
 Everyone is equal, everyone has a right, everyone is longing, therefore joy and peace, happiness.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.600
 That's the great for that reason, the great Master Shandi Deva said, source of every joy.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:11.040
 The one medicine that killed all sufferings, that's the teaching. That is the teaching.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.080
 So therefore, I mean again, this is so special. We are all connected and thankful, grateful,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.920
 with courage and commitment, loyalty and confidence, and pray that we continue to hold this up,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.680
 hold this teaching in our heart and mind and share the others, and not just only that,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.120
 throughout our lifetimes, until I become the brotherhood, until all living beings are

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.240
 enlightenment, may I able to hold teaching and continue caring. That is the statement,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.960
 wish of all the bodhisattvas, all those great Masters, great practitioners. As I said,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.560
 we make that statement, that is great offering. But great Master Moharramudya said,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.000
 when he wrote such famous commentary on the Mademaka Alankara, that which is written by the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.280
 great Master Shanda Rakchata and his statements, he said that the great Master Shanda Rakchata

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.920
 don't need gold and the syllabus, all that. But when you hold up the teachings that will benefit

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:31.200
 to all the sentient beings, that is the great offerings, great offering, marital activities.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.960
 So great Master Moharramudya said, wherever this great teacher is watching me, watching me,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:47.360
 I make these offerings to please him. So may I hold this great teaching. That's what the statement

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.400
 meant by the great Master Moharramudya, it's true. In the teaching, see, one holds up the teaching

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.240
 practice and helping sentient beings with bodhisattva, love and kindness, that is the

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.440
 great offerings, great marital activities for us and also big mental offerings to all the beings.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.160
 So again, with the beautiful intentions taught, all those joy and appreciation,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.520
 to get with the bodhisattva, again, it's the love and kindness to compare you to all sentient

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.080
 beings.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.040
 May that my practice, the meditation of the Chifsuyunyakta, may I actualize this lifetime,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.920
 this realization, really exactly as the great Master Shanda Rakchata and the benefits of all

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.000
 living beings, being second, really reaching those sincerity from heart and mind, then that is

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.400
 really

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.730
 the big, good practitioners and that we're making meaning for our lives. The remaining love,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.240
 whatever

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:51.520
 we have, we're making good, meaningful. We're carrying something, good impact. We're carrying

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.400
 beautiful treasures with us, not going to leave behind us, become maybe cause of the argument and

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:05.040
 fighting, but we are going to carry that with our, that treasures, treasures and going to

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.600
 lemonade and bright up our part of stages and bright up our futures and then bright up

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.040
 some degree of the living beings and sentient beings, those we connect
