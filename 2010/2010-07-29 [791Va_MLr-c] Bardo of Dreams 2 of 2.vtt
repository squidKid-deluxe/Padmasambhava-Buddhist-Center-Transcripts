00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 So true. That's our ultimate. That's our grasping. Those are the trouble tutors, according to them.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Those are the trouble tutors. That makes the trouble start.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 All this is difficult to the troubles. It started with grasping, clinging, and attachment.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.330
 The attachment to all this is to have state. So now to practice dream yoga means we break through

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 that attachment.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 We break through that grasping, that clinging, that regiment. See the reality as it is.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.700
 As it is. We're not portraying, we're trying to not make something different, but trying to see the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.000
 reality.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.530
 In fact, as it is. How to find it? What's it called? Fact-finding mission. We are in a fact-finding

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 mission.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 That's why we are all practicing as a fact-finding mission. So we try to really find the facts and

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.000
 then we like to stay there.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.430
 We don't like to change. Change that unique. You see, find the facts. That's why Buddha is one of

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.000
 them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 The natural teacher, that's your simple nature. Nothing higher, nothing lower than that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Not understanding, not our state. Simple, teach, natural as it is, Buddha pointed out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.940
 We sentient beings, not staying on the natural. Because duality, grasping, clinging, we twisted

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.000
 nature so many ways.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Then we caught in the tunnel, and those are then, as we used the example yesterday, cocoons.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 Cocoons thread. All this grasping, clinging, no matter whatever we think, is thread that is tied up

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 our side.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 So the dream you are practicing is coming back to the natural as it is.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.380
 So when we got to practice and fulfil that part of the good dream you are practicing in the night,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.000
 where we are sleeping,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 we had to start right daytime, where we wake up, and we had to reaffirm everything is true.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 We heard this teaching many times. We read in the books many times.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 The reading books, hearing the teaching is not enough.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 We have to practice that. We have to reaffirm that realization again and again.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Therefore, in the teaching set, this is during the day.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.080
 We have to take this is during the day. Truly this is during. When you are walking, talking,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 sleeping, spending,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 or any action we are doing, a week and a half once in a while is during the day.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Then we start practicing, during the hours.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 My father used to put his feelings in the floor of the boat.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 He put the letter. He read his own letter and put it on his cupboard.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 He said, "This experience is all dream."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Really he put that right on there. So he can see that. All is dream.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 This experience, this appearance is all dream.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 He did that. It's not just he did, but in the teaching he said, "It's good to remind yourself again

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 and again."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 If you will not practice in dream, it's good to remind. This is dream.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 This is illuke. This is magic. This is variety. This is the bubble.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I mean, those are the reason Buddha used to wake our past, to highlight, to bring this reality.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Because duality is so solid, so clingy, and then we just change, and then we don't see.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 But reality, really, it is dream. All is dream. All is illuke. All is magic.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And that is again, as we see. And we know now, at least so far, that we are going to understand.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 It's just a really natural dream. And that we have to be assured again and again in a duality to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.000
 time.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 And that is very important for Pacifica, also those who want to practice in dream, yoga.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Where we sleep, we don't practice. So here, with those thoughts, then of course, it will do.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And with those kind of understanding, then we practice the dream yoga.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 When you come to the dream yoga practices, in the course, of course, you will see the instructions.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And this is the way that I've been teaching.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 What I've learned from the many great masters, as all of them, also have this.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 This is how we get started.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And now, of course, when you go to the pose, I will go with those, what I said already,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 you have that thought strongly. But before you go to bed, that's how you hear it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 You sit, sit up on your bed.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 In the teaching also said, sometimes you sit with these said postures.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Said postures don't stay in closed back, but sit with it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I think in the Doki teaching last times, I've met it quite a few times.
