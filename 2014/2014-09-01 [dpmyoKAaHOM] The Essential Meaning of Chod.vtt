NOTE     "synopsis": "On August 18, 2014 at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Rinpoche taught the essential meaning of Chod Practice to everyone gathered for the 2014 Chod Vajrayana Ritual Retreat.\n\n\"By the power of the four causes, a bodhisattva will become so strong. Such a bodhisattva cannot be defeated by the four demons.\"\n\nThe Four Powers of Chod Practice are:\n\n1. Emptiness\n2. Compassion\n3. Maintaining Your Commitments Exactly as you Promised\n4. Receiving the Blessings of the Buddhas by Your Devotion\n\nThe Four Demons are:\n\n1. Tangible Demons\n2. Intangible Demons\n3. Excitement Demons\n4. Grasping\n\n\"All the four demons come down to the one demon of grasping.\"\n-Machig Labdron\n\nChod is a special Vajrayana practice that removes suffering instantly by targeting our most sensitive delusions and immediately cutting through all types of attachment and ego-clinging without any hesitation, hope or fear.\n\nFrom August 19-21, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche taught us the history, lineage, & meaning of Chod, as well as imparted heart advice & pith instructions on the actual practice according to the terma of \"The Bellowing Laugh of the Dakini\" revealed by the great terton Jigme Lingpa.\n\nDuring this retreat we learned and practiced various elements of the ceremony together, including: Chod lineage melodies and chants performed by the nuns at the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches\u2019 nunnery in India, drumming, and using bells and dorjes. We also watched special Chod films of the PBC nuns practicing the Tsasum Lingpa Chod in India, as well as the nuns at Nagi Gompa in Nepal performing a Chod dance.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Two practices. That again, of course, you already know this, but two practices means uproot, right?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 You have graspings, uproot in the grasp. You is a Tibetan word, Tibetan word, which means cutting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.920
 As like Tritum, it is the same root syllabus. Tritum. Same root syllabus. Cutting. Completely

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.000
 cutting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.720
 What cuts? Cuts is graceful. What the great master Mahadegala Ruhar Sahib said, this great Ruhar

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.000
 Sahib says,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 "In the reality level, there is nothing to cut. There is no cutting that cuts." But on the surface,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 on the relative level,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.620
 something that you cannot, something that you are scared to do, you are performing that. You are

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 performing. You are cutting that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 So scary things to crush with doesn't end. That is the cutting. Now, this teaching generally how

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Buddha said,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 again, as I said, I already said that, but the Buddha teaching, particularly in the Vadapara Mother

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 teaching said,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 clearly what Buddha said, "By the poor powers, by the poor powers, a great..." Generally, it is in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 the...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 I am trying to recollect in it my to be in the brains and then try to put in the English brains. So

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.000
 that is how it happens.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And in the teaching said, by the power of the poor causes, causes the bodhisattva become so strong,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 so powerful, so powerful.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 That bodhisattva cannot be defeated by the demons or the negatives, demons. That bodhisattva cannot

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.000
 be defeated by the poor demons

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 because so powerful by the poor causes that bodhisattva. What are those four powers? That also,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.000
 Buddha said, right after that,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:52.800
 is brain realization of the emptiness and never neglected any sentient beings and maintain it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.000
 exactly as you promised it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.760
 and with the blessings of the Buddha, so God has. So that, that is the poor powers. What are those

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.000
 four powers?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.720
 Now again, first word, brain realization of the emptiness. This means emptiness of the Pandya Param

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000
ata.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.800
 Pandya Paramata nature, nature of the Pandya Paramata is absolute nature. It is not negation,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.000
 emptiness, blank emptiness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:48.880
 It's not that emptiness. This emptiness is openness, envy, freedom, that emptiness having that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.000
 realization.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:03.760
 Then second, never give up the sentient beings. That means, that is compassion. Never give up any

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 sentient beings by your compassion.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.040
 Even you have the highest realization of the Pandya Paramata, or even the highest realization of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.000
 the Pandya Paramata,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 then never separate the kuk. All beings by compassion. Compassion and Pandya Paramata are the same.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.490
 Compassion is the Pandya Paramata. Pandya Paramata is compassion. So don't let pulse dilute by the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.000
 conceptions.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Kind of neglecting and trying to sort it out. That is demon. And we try to do that. In this case,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 that's the demon.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.980
 Compassion and realization of the emptiness of the Pandya Paramata, or the Dzogchi realization,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.000
 goes as one, one entities, not two entities.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.860
 Even there are two names, where nature is expressing, is expressing the two different ways. But it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.000
's the same.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.300
 So that is what this body suffers. If they maintain their two powers, first power, emptiness and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 compassion.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Third, the power of what you said. That is our commitment.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Keeping up the exiling conduct is also our conduct. Exiling maintains the conduct.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Where would I give the teaching? Where you learn? And what are the traditional things?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:59.760
 Every goodness tradition is good. Good. And particularly in the teaching, such as we committed, we

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.000
 said we will keep up the vows.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.130
 Vows of the suttas, vatimokas, vows of the bodhisattvas, vows of the vedayanas, we didn't kidding

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.000
 that time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.680
 We said we will do. It's not just that we not diluted ourselves with a clear mind, clear state,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.000
 clear mind.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 We met that point. Keeping up that is generally known as conduct, morality.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.200
 That will keep up, keep up our identity and our status of the realization. Dripping up that. So

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.000
 that is known as second power.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.720
 Third power, with blessings of the buddhas, not suttas, fourth power, with the blessings of the s

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.000
uttas.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.300
 This is keeping all the teachings, keeping all the practices, not sorting out, not reject, not

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.000
 criticize, not listen.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.300
 Every Buddha teachings, Prahinayana teaching, always such as the Mahat-aki teachings, is teaching,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.000
 special teachings.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.690
 Whatever we can cooperate and activate, we should bring and grow and beautify ourselves, beautify

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:34.000
 help to the others through your love and compassion, as is never give up the sentient beings.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.340
 These four powers, every king, her and that Buddha said, that bodhisattva cannot be defeated by

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.000
 poor demons, poor demons.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.300
 This is what the teaching is now. All about the two practices. Voo, meditation and conduct result

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.000
 comes by these practices.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.750
 And when we practice the Jew with ritual objects, trying to maintain that, of course at the

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.000
 beginning we are learning this.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.850
 This may be difficult, but when we practice the Jew, generally we are really trying to maintain

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.000
 that palette, that will.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.300
 Then it is really very powerful two practices. Then it really makes our thought worthy and hero,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.000
 and hero, and hero is.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 As Mahatma Bhaktam Vassani, as Bodhisattva Muni, as the Guru Pramma Sambha, as the Sichin Sahaja,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 truly that is become.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.450
 And the external is so simple, humble, drawn to the earth, low key, very humility, what is it

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.000
 called? Humility?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Humility is very humility, calm and peaceful and very nice.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And that is what an inwardly powerful stone, fearless, cannot be beat by these poor demons.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.630
 And now, what are the poor demons? These poor demons, poor demons are then forced in, known as

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:21.000
 tangible demons, tangible demons.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.990
 And the second is intangible demons. If I translate it roughly, that. Third is excitement demons.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.000
 And fourth is grasp.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.460
 Grecius again, Madam Mahatma Prabhu, Herr Salva said, those are the poor demons, but all that poor

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:49.000
 demon comes to the one demon is the grasping demon.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 So that means tangible demon, intangible demon, excited demon, all comes to the grasping demon.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.700
 That grasping demon is the root of everything. Then it can be explained so many ways, too many

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.000
 different ways to explore.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.470
 It is so precise. Clearly, also we can talk sometimes, but that is what we are going to cut by

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.000
 these practices.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.630
 So that is really overview of the two practices. Their view, their meditation, their kundra and

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.000
 their result.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.420
 Result is then become, as I said, become warriors, Buddha, and Grecius, Madam Mahatma Prabhu, Patam

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.000
 Mahatma Prabhu, all those great masters.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.760
 Master Ho-Jing-Bing-Lung-Bao and Paul Salva, Do-Jing-Lung-Bao, those great, fearless yogis, yoginis

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.000
, that is what they defeated.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.540
 The negativities, the root of negativity, grasp, cleanliness. They are not caught with all grasping

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.000
, cleanliness.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Cleanliness. So that is really overview of the two practices.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.040
 And now, when you practice it, this is. It has all this, this. And then, of course, sometimes we

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.000
 can talk about that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.990
 Then you do practices. These two practices, here making it particularly, going to the scary places,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.000
 all the kundra, like outward locations.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.090
 This is generally what the teachings said. Every great master said, "We'll do this when you have

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.000
 some stabilizations of your realizations."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.920
 Or what that means, not just you. When we have some stable realizations, we go to the scary places

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.000
 to defeat that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Scary is, of course, big obstacles, big issues in our lives. Scary is that.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:09.830
 But fundamentally, that scary comes from where? It's grasp. It's grasp. It's clinging. Clinging to

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.000
 the object, clinging to the subject.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.610
 Subject. Particularly, clinging to the scary things, comes immediately, deals with it, clinging to

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.000
 one's own self.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.540
 That means, what did Buddha take? He said, "Ego, cling." That's ego. Ego, we're clinging to the ego

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.000
.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:46.550
 Ego, cling. That is the territory or the light of the ego, clinging. When we scale, that means that

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.000
.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.710
 Therefore, when you have the realization now, when you have nice kind of realization, understanding

00:12:54.710 --> 00:13:00.000
 of those things, now you're going to the powerful, scary places.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Scary places to activate your scary attitude, to bring out your scares.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.700
 Because those powerful scholars will be scared to go, or some scared that. What are even those

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.000
 scary places?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Now you bring up that thought. Because now you're being, we're not scared on the beach, right?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.900
 We're not being scared in our beautiful kind of places, or wherever, those parks and gardens, all

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.000
 these things.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 But now, we're getting scared. This is something that, so, now you're going to scary places, trying

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 to,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 now everything is going so smooth and so beautiful, but trying to make sure that really we defeated

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 our grasping, our clinging, our ego clinging, that.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 So then go to the scary places. Scary places. And then, you practice.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 This practice is known as demo. What did the teacher say? To boost our realization.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 What is to boost our realization? You go to the scary places.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 When you go to the scary places, here, here, the great master said it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 If you have this text, then he said it. He said it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 You're not going there with the "add worldly concerns." Add worldly concerns.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.070
 You're not, that is the bottom line. You're not going there with the "add worldly concerns" to the

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.000
 scary places.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 You're going there with genuine, that poor powers, with compassion and love, with full bondless.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Love, compassion, those poor bondless are not going to repeat that. You know that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 With full bondless, then you're going there.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 How are you going there? Really, then add hate.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Wait. There's many different ways to go to the scary places,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 where you're going to go with four different ways.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Among that, the fourth one, with the realization.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 With the realization, you will walk to that place.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 What's the realization? That means your conduct is good.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Your will is good. Your practice is good with the confidence.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And may keep up that, will go that. Walk as a lion. Lion to that place.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And humble and simple as the Buddha or sage, calm and peaceful, love and compassion.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Fill with the heart feeling. What is also known as dual practice, crazy, versatile activities.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Crazy, versatile activities fill with the bondness of compassion, or infinite compassion.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Heart is filled with infinite compassion, but fearless as crazy, versatile.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 You have no hope and no expectations.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Walking as a lion, I say, with them.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And then there's also teaching, many things here.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 But those we can discuss, sometimes we can talk, all that.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 And then with humble, simple, keeping up the meditation, practices.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.260
 Then it's dual practices. And then there's when you do practice, dual practices, as I said, with

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.000
 devotion.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 When you practice is, as I said, devotion, joy, bodhicaka.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Exactly as by the blessings of the Buddhas, blessings of the Buddhas.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 As you sit to do, and the realization of the emptiness and the compassion.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Compassion and practice, practices.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 So, and then with all these beautiful implements, these ritual objects, and your practices.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.310
 And then among these ritual objects, then this is one of the big, famous ritual objects, the dham

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.000
maras.
