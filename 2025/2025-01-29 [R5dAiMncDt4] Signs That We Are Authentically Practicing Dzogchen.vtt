00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 This is from the last line of page 11, and then let's continue from here.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.880
 "Win what? Win what? Follow with the lama. Your devotion grows, ever greater."

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:29.600
 And while listening to the teachings, splint down, your mind is ever, ever more tamed.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 And when anger and attachment and aversion gradually decrease, these are the signs that Dharma has

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 excellently benefited to your mind or the practitioners.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.860
 So those are signs of the achievement and signs of the realization, or signs of that we are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.200
 practicing, sign of the way of practicing.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.850
 Not practicing becomes the intellectual and the kind of record of history, but really we are

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.400
 putting practices on it, to our heart and the practices.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:23.120
 This is the teaching. So devotion, what means devotion generally? Of course, we all know devotion,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.000
 faith and devotion.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 But devotion, when you have the devotion, that means your confidence is strong.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 Confidence, when you have confidence that there is no room of doubt and hesitation, you are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.800
 determined, you are set up, you are not lingering, not jumping everywhere.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 You are set up. Because it's also contaminant. You feel so happy. I don't have a job. So many

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.200
 things. You feel really happy.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 So then, when you have that more confidence, then the obstacles cannot interfere in our practices.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 What are those I mentioned three times, and you all know. Many of you know.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 I grant Dr. Narodjana said, this is not just in the Narodjana teaching, but other teachings.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.060
 For the teaching, mention, watch out these obstacles. When you don't have the devotion, when you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.800
 don't have the confidence,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.400
 what are those? Wild mind. Mind has become restless. Mind has become.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.400
 And then, those are connected with such as calm in a different form of the wildness, stress force,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.600
 deep breathing, anxieties, and all these worries, all those become.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.630
 Then, the next one also could come. Not all can come at the same time, but then some degree of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.600
 regret, feel bad, feel guilty, and then you feel guilty,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 and maybe start blaming yourself, or one's own self, or blaming the others. Others can become wild.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:46.960
 So those are the post and seconds. Wild. And then, mind has become, because our body has become

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.600
 wild, we couldn't control it nicely,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:00.930
 and then become kind of a little bit of resentment post, resentment, or kind of harsh post. And

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.600
 then, even when we try to meditate, it becomes more poggy.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:18.160
 More poggy minds. And then, maybe it becomes a little more laziness, and the sleepiness, laziness,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.600
 laziness.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.680
 And then, also, then start more craving, craving to the old pleasures of the senses, or reflecting

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.600
 the pleasures of the past,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 bring back, trying to cultivate that in mind and heart. More heart. And then, mind becomes poggy.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 Oh no, sorry, not poggy already, I said. Then, doubt. Doubt and hesitation.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.460
 Skepticals. And we come now, can't be like completely. Now, we lost the balance of our courage and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.600
 commitment and confidence.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:25.100
 Those can happen even long-term practitioners, because the life of, for what? What is life of? Dev

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.600
otions.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:35.600
 Life of pain, or what you would know, language we use, worldwide we use, pain or the devotions.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.810
 When we don't have the pain, or when we don't have the devotees, even the nadir jubchi teaching is

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.600
 all right in your ear, or right in your way,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.600
 kind of don't feel something, big things, and it becomes all, something.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.600
 Oh, this is nothing, I heard this, I heard that, I've heard this, they're saying these things.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:06.000
 And kind of like, in the sense of, look closely, kind of like mostly, don't great at that. The

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.600
 authentic teaching. Why?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 Because you couldn't end it, you couldn't connect it to the heart.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:25.120
 Courage, the force of those obstacles, was what great, great master Navarajan said, watch out these

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.600
 obstacles.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 They had like kind of a highness on the, on the road of path to the enlightenment.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 They had like banditos on the path to the enlightenment. They were disturbed.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:47.370
 Our practice, this is not just only the way we were disturbed, our practice, but even when you have

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.600
 those, those five different, those obstacles point in samsara,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.600
 our achievement will be demolished, become really completely jumbo, mumbo status, all that.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:09.830
 So that means, when we have the devotions, that means, as I said, it's confidence, feel the

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.600
 precious, feel joy, appreciate it.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 Oh, how wonderful, I'm now connected, I'm here, I can now develop.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 From now, look to the, like read, read the books of the Malarepa.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 Malarepa, when you read the books of the lifestyle of Malarepa, how delicious.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 To his lineage, to the teachings.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.600
 He sings songs with pure joy, pure love, pure devotions.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 As his devotions and all that grows, his realization is growing.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.840
 His realization understands the development, not just the realization of the true nature of mind,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.600
 but his knowledge is expanding.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:14.760
 Wisdom is expanding. He didn't go into, according to his story, he didn't go to the academics, or

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.600
 in the cheda, in the community called cheda, or studying.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:28.090
 But when we read the life story, or the singing of his songs, it captures the essence of the Buddha

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.600
's teachings, really essence of the Buddha's teachings.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:41.480
 So simple, so kind of simple, and easy, and presented to us, and can't go in touch to penetrate to

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.600
 the heart.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.600
 In the teaching, many times, in the teaching said, in those great masters saying that,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.600
 when you heard, heard, or when you read the life story of Malarepa,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 when you read the guide to where the life story of Mother Satva was, if it didn't change your mind,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 you don't make any change, then our mind is really hard.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:17.740
 But when you start reading of the life story of Malarepa, and guide to the way the life story of

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.600
 Mother Satva,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 then it's that unfilled something tender to our heart and mind. That means you're ready to settle,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600
 settle and to grow.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:36.760
 Those are really teaching said. That Malarepa's realization started with one pointed unjakable

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.600
 devotion.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 Then, it becomes one of the greatest, greatest masters and Siddhas in the Buddhist historians.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 So, then that is the sign of the realization.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.600
 And then, here you see, the next one is the second sign of teaching.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 And as you heard the teaching, Subhana Yidana, your mind has become more trained.
