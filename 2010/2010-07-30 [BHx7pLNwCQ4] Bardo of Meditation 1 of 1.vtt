00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 "Bardo is, of course, particularly, it is not that everybody has this meditation part.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.760
 It is generally for the practitioners, because everybody doesn't practice.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.440
 Also, they don't do the meditation, or situations, meditating.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.000
 But in this case, it is those who are practicing "Bardo" of the meditation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.560
 And again, "Bardo" is not necessarily only the next.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.080
 After death, "Bardo" is as we said, or the teachings said,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.560
 "from the time we deluded until we were in enlightenment, whole thing is really "Bardo".

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.150
 "Bardo" is nothing kind of necessarily unusual, or bad, or strange, but it is just "Bardo" like

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.920
 that.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 So when we are, for example, practicing meditation, then we should make that meditation more

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.840
 college.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 College is not meditation. College practices. That is so important.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 I mean the "Bardo" of the meditation. Like, meditation is done.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.760
 Here, translated, the common politics in the Tibetan is "Santi".

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.680
 "Santi" is, I think, in Sanskrit world, "Dyan", and translated into Tibetan, "Santi".

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.480
 "Sampa" "Tepo" in the Tibetan. "Sampa" means "mind". "Tepo" means "step".

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.000
 So very stable mind. That actually means concentration of meditation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.150
 So meditation, as we all know, in the genders speaking, in Buddhism point of view, or Buddhist

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 teaching,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 there are two meditations. "Shamatha" meditation and "Vipassana" meditation.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:01.120
 These two are the meditations. "Shamatha" is then what? It is stabilizing the mind.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.760
 First in our mind, we all know so much Buddhism, so much unsteady.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.660
 And most of the time, our mind is carried by with all different emotional thoughts, one after

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 another.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.640
 And those, generally, in the teaching, again, say there are three kind of thoughts.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.400
 And positive thoughts, negative thoughts, and neutral thoughts.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.280
 And we start on a high light of the old, every kind of observing to our thoughts,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 distantly looking to what kind of really thought we have among the three categories.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.760
 Most of the time, it may be something connected with emotions, our thoughts.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:03:00.120
 And then there may be, or more, very neutral, negative thoughts, very little positive thoughts.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:14.550
 If we count the percentage level, maybe 60% may be emotional thoughts, 20% may be, or 25% really

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.560
 neutral thoughts, or 30%.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.800
 And maybe 15% or 10% positive thoughts. Maybe that's how it is.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.840
 It is, and that's what we are, whether we believe it or not.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:37.180
 And we're talking more practical, looking inwardly to ourself, by ourself, without watching big

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.640
 laws behind.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:47.070
 And we look ourself, and everything more practical, think that's really the way out most of the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.840
 time.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.640
 And then that positive, negative means what?

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.160
 Most of the time it's then as good as thought, the three positives, or the five positives, or the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.640
 six positives, those are the negatives.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.800
 So that our mind is most of the time wondering, combination of those three, five, or six, or all

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.440
 kind of high light, one of those, those are the most of the time, both.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.070
 And then neutral thoughts, and positive. And this neutral, positive and negative is the strong

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.240
 producer of the karmic affectors, a color of teaching.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 That produce strongly karmic. That, what we do, it responds back to ourself.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.280
 We accumulated that karmic where, in the teachings said, in our life, so according the strength and

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.090
 the duty, consequence of the action of this our mind, of the whether is positive, whether is

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.040
 negative, we create the karmic.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.040
 And the positive actions result in the karmic, known as then good karmas.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.840
 And they get a result to action, or result in action in the bad karmas, that consequence of that.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 And that karmic kind of echoes back to ourself.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.840
 This is generally the law of the nature.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.580
 Whatever we do, it really responds to most of the time that we even can see that, that we see anger

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.840
 brings more anger.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.640
 Law of kindness brings more law of kindness, and joy brings more joy.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.640
 And sadness brings more sadness.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:39.640
 And that we can see, it's not natural, it's hiding, deceiving us, but we can really see.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 Even we see, even we know, due to our ego clinging, due to our goal, this department, we act.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.440
 Reluctantly and kind of almost all of ourself, then we do all these things.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.440
 The Buddha pointed highlight all this, pointed out, and highlighted all that.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.440
 And therefore, we as practitioners, we try to correct those things by ourself, with mindfulness,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 with assistive alertness, and consciousness.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.440
 That we try to really correct those things.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.240
 And that is not a spent practice of dharma.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.830
 So in this way, when we started thinking of the Vedic concentrations, so emotions are always very,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.240
 very disturbances.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 And therefore, then this Sharmata meditation is very important at the beginning of time,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 particularly always, of course, it's important, always, that Sharmata meditation.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.040
 And in the Buddha teaching, as I think, maybe you've heard that, there is many emotions.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.350
 For example, when you have more, the attachment problems in the Buddha teaching in the Sharmata

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.040
 level.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 Buddha said, meditate on them, come like, what's called, something that you don't attach to.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040
 Meditate on them.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.040
 That means attachment, when we attach it, we're always looking on the surface.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.040
 Surface, then we attach it.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.040
 But Buddha said, look deep of them.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.040
 Behind that scene of their surface, look deep, deeply, deeply, then think, oh, what is that?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:30.690
 When you attach, what that has, even the surface looks so nice, it maybe looks like a cover-up,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.040
 cover-up things.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 But behind the scene, there is also smellings.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:45.630
 And the Buddha still thinks that the smellings, those smellings, not just the only thing on the

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.040
 surface.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:56.040
 And also sometimes, I'm sure you read that also, the ugliness, ugliness, dirty.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.040
 This is not just Buddha making up there.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 But those are the really truly existing behind the scene of that ongoing attachment.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.580
 So therefore, Buddha said, if you so attach it, so much attachment, think of those behind the

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.040
 scenes.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.040
 There's many different categories of that, that you go forward, one after another, all that, that.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.070
 And trying to break down your attachment so we can rest our mind that we're more comfortable,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.040
 peaceful.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.040
 And then we have about emotions of anger.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:37.040
 And Buddha said, meditate on loving kindness, more bring love, loving kindness, bring more love.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 Why?

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.070
 For example, when we get angry, angry must be doing some mistakes of others, others do some

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.040
 mistakes.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.040
 They're doing something that we don't feel happy.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:58.040
 But again, looking behind the scenes, they're doing that activity because it's not so wise.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.040
 They're doing that activity because of the stupidity, ignorance.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:15.060
 So therefore, it is not the error of that person's death. But it's a mistake, of course it is

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.040
 stupid.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:22.040
 Therefore, I should be loved, kind, trying to bring more love.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.040
 Even he didn't express him into the love, but bring more passion to thought.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.040
 Passion is part of the loving kindness.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.040
 Bring more passion, more tolerance, and let him go. Apply to those ketones.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040
 So therefore, in the teachings, that will also reduce the restless of the mind,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.040
 of the wildness and the very more calm and peaceful of the Shammata meditation.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.040
 Will there be many different versions of the Shammata meditations?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.040
 And then, if we get so much, again, problem with ignorance,
