In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 The kind of the generating bodhicitta. Again, bodhicitta, of course, we all know intellectually

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.840
 a little bit. We know that, but bodhicitta is the Sanskrit role and it means the mind

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.240
 of enlightenment. All bodhi, if we translate it to Buddha, then Buddha is the mind, mind

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.120
 of the Buddha. So Buddha mind or the enlightened mind. And what is the enlightened mind? Buddha

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:41.180
 mind is our love, the compassion, wisdom. What are the Buddha mind? That is Buddha mind.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 But that's great master, Guru Padmasambha said in his teaching, "Love and compassion, wisdom,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.480
 the mind of the Buddha, if you have that attitude, you're keeping your way, you're keeping life

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.360
 of the mind with the Buddha." So these three are really the mind of the Buddha. And then

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 particularly bodhicitta is, that is, I mean, that is the mind with the Buddha. Buddha.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.240
 Now when we do the bodhicitta, it's slightly, it's not slightly, it's activating that mind.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.560
 We're more activating that. And now if we say, who had that bodhicitta? Who had this love

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 and compassion and wisdom? According to the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, every

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:46.360
 living we have the love and compassion, wisdom. Because it's the Buddha nature. The love and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.080
 the compassion, wisdom is light of the Buddha nature. It's arising energy of the Buddha

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:06.440
 nature. No one is the light of the compassion, love and wisdom everyone has. If they don't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.960
 have love and compassion with them, people or individual cannot survive. Even the mostly

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.520
 obscured ego person or self-important, even they have love, they have compassion, they

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.160
 have wisdom. If they don't have any of those, no one can survive. Survive. Love and compassion

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.600
 and wisdom is, even the mischievous times of the Inaba samsara or lower, lowest realm

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:52.060
 every bone, still we have that. But that time, love and compassion and wisdom is so small,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:02.200
 so small, so limited because he really obscured by the dualities, negative obscurations. Then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.960
 human beings, everyone has love and compassion and wisdom. Everyone, when you have love and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.240
 compassion and wisdom, their activity in human being, when they do activity, those are known

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.580
 as good activities, virtuous activities. Whoever that may be, whatever that name, if they're

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.400
 doing something good, helping to someone, helping support it to someone that is, come

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:42.760
 from love, come from compassion, come from wisdom. But that is again, is limited love,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.880
 limited compassion, limited wisdom. And that caused what the Buddha teaching said, when

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.080
 you activity of love and compassion and wisdom, if you do that activity, it will take the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.560
 birth in higher realms, in God's realms, all human realms, that activities. But now, both

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.640
 each other love and compassion, wisdom is something different, has no boundaries. Both each other

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:25.030
 has love as no boundaries, no, no, no restrictions. And thinking of all living beings, that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.000
 compassion

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.480
 is spread out to all living beings. That love is spread out for all living beings. That

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:42.000
 wisdom is spread out to all, understanding everything. And that is known as both each

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.600
 other, love and compassion. That all combination, for that reason, combination of that, the

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.680
 end of the we all know, in this talk, I'm talking relative to the relative body, so

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.760
 this body that can be divided or not can be, is divided in the teaching to both each other.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.720
 That we heard so many times, relative both each other and the absolute true both each

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.680
 other. So true both each other. And relative both each other is what we're talking, love

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.080
 and compassion to all living beings. Wisdom, understanding that, that is relative both each

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.880
 other to all living beings. How to activate that compassion as the greatest teacher of

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:40.720
 Buddha mentioned? The poor immeasurable, immeasurable. Love, immeasurable compassion, immeasurable

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:51.640
 but your immeasurable of the equities. That is relative both each other. Both each other,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.040
 love, both each other, compassion. It's called immeasurable. And of course you understand,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.800
 of course, you know already, but why it's called immeasurable? It's because it is called

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:16.080
 known as immeasurable. Love and compassion is immeasurable. The object of this both each

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.560
 other, love and compassion is immeasurable. If I use that word, that way. Subject of love

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:38.240
 and compassion is immeasurable. Benefit is immeasurable, immeasurable, your number. And

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:48.310
 the time limitation is immeasurable. Therefore called immeasurable. What means object is immeas

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.640
urable.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:58.280
 With the projection of the both each other, both each other, we project all living beings.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:07.960
 Not just a few peoples or few beings or this area, that area. No, all living beings, to

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:17.120
 every living being. So therefore the object where we are focusing is immeasurable. And

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.720
 the Buddha teaching said that living beings have no numbers. How many beings there? No

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:34.400
 numbers. That in the teaching said that as far as space goes, that far-sentence beings

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:45.800
 are existing. As far as long or as far as sentient beings are existing, that far or

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:55.360
 that long, that much everyone has emotions and the karmas. As long as they have emotions

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.400
 and the karmas, there is the experience of the suffering is endless. Continue it goes

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:13.080
 to everyone. Therefore, feel all living beings, compassion, to all living beings. This, so

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:20.000
 that. And then when we feel compassion, we are not limiting ourselves. Subject is also

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.080
 immeasurable to all the beings. We open a treasure of our love and compassion from our Rooka,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.120
 from that great emptiness, Dharma Dato, feel from beginning. There is no restriction, no

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:47.800
 shortages, to all living beings. And the action is also is immeasurable or not targeted this

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.440
 and that to every living being. And benefit is in the teaching said, is also really immeasurable,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.520
 even though we don't detect it immediately with our eyes and thoughts. Thought is immeasurable.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.160
 The Rooka's teacher, Buddha Kishakamuni, said in the one, his sotra teacher said, "If the

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.440
 benefit of the body jata, our one intention of the body jata or immeasurable thought, thought

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:26.200
 is the f that comes in the poem, in the poem, f-o-r-m poem, even the space is not big enough

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:36.360
 to fit. F-I-T, I believe, to fit. It completely fills the whole sky. That one time our true

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.640
 benefit in thought, our own immeasurable thought, we activated that in heart and mind, that benefit

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:51.720
 have come in the poem, poem side, this even the sky is smaller. Can't fit that. So much

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.760
 power. There are so many also beautiful stories, I'm sure you know, for having is that beautiful

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.560
 thought, immediately it will purify obscurations, obstacles, negativities, heal ourselves, really

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.960
 that. And the greatest teacher, Buddha Kishakamuni, when he was first come to develop the efficient

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.760
 body jata in heart, that time he was born in hell realms. And poorly, I'm sure you, we heard

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:24.760
 so many from that stories, pulling the iron chariot, chariot with the one friend, two of them

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:33.240
 pulling, pulling the iron chariot is so heavy and other friend is so weak. But they said the agent

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.520
 of the hell realm is beating him, that other one. And that Buddha who was born as in hell realm,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.920
 he feels so compassionate. Why he's beating because it can't have the cover, he don't have

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.480
 the standards. I wish I can pull all together, target. So he had that beautiful intention thought

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.800
 one second or beginning time. And in the teaching said that clay with his karma of being in that

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:07.080
 hell realm, and then left to the from the from there to the higher realms. And that is the

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.880
 beginning of the, in the teaching said, said, wishing bodhicata that greatest teacher Buddha

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:22.840
 Kishakamuni developed, wishing bodhicata from that on, then he did that. So this bodhicata is so

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:30.120
 powerful, so special, so that, so this relative bodhicata is, and that's what also this relative

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:37.400
 bodhicata makes, for example, Mahayana's. Mahayana, just this thinking between Mahayana and

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:44.520
 foundation school is because of bodhicata. What that is, bodhicata is relative bodhicata.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:50.440
 When you have the strong relative bodhicata of this wish, best upon the poor,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.400
 immacurable, then that practitioners is known as Mahayana practitioners.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.800
 Even they don't have the name of Mahayana practitioners, they are Mahayana practitioners,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.920
 and they are the poor, boneless. Mahayana is not external labels. Mahayana is the

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.960
 measurement of the degree of our attitude in the computations, how we develop those, and

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:25.160
 really in the teaching said, it's true, this bodhicata is really that. So bodhicata when we

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:32.040
 developed, and we developed time, we feel compassion, and take the bodhicata, wow,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.040
 when we take the bodhicata, wow. In the teaching said, bodhicata,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.160
 compassion, the bodhicata has a true, true highlight, or I'm not using, I said many times,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:53.000
 three, bodhicata is compassion, loving kindness, and wisdom. So if I put compassion and loving

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.600
 kindness as one, and then wisdom as two, there's two qualities. And so in the teaching said,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:08.360
 compassion and loving kindness, you project to all living beings, more focus to all living beings.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:16.280
 Worship them is projected to the enlightenment, your achievement, your goal. Why? In the teaching

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.320
 said, because when you have more compassion, loving kindness, you like to help all living

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.560
 beings, but I cannot do it, can't help everything, whatever you want to do. Kind of even where our

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:34.920
 heart is completely open, but our ability is kind of short, full short. For that reason,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.000
 then get enlightenment. So projecting to get enlightenment so that I can benefit for all

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.440
 living beings, more forever, continually. So that is so one and other children,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:55.880
 compassion is projected to all living beings, and wisdom is kind of projected to get enlightenment,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:04.310
 and the combination is then wisdom and compassion, and I'm adding loving kindness, kindness. So

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.000
 then

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.600
 that is known as wishing bodhicata. You take the bodhicata, wow, and then practice the bodhicata.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:24.280
 Then when we reach it, when we will achieve the absolute bodhicata. Absolute bodhicata,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:31.080
 this is absolute bodhicata here, this teaching, for example here, second chariot of the generating

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:39.240
 bodhicata, that this is absolute bodhicata. We're activating absolute bodhicata now,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.800
 but when we will get absolute bodhicata,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:52.920
 when by the practice, continually we will reach the absolute bodhicata, according to the teaching,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:59.960
 we will get absolute bodhicata perfect when we reach the perfect bodhicata, or same path.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:08.840
 Same path or first bodhicata, then we have the perfect absolute bodhicata. This time,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:15.480
 for example, when we meditate in jokki status, when we stroke and then when we discard the wu,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:23.160
 perfectly, and then we maintain it, that that time, as long as we can be able to maintain,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:31.720
 that long is absolute bodhicata, that long. So when we, for example, in this case, in the teaching

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.200
 mentioned, we learned then looking to the lookers, moment we look to look, looking to the lookers,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.720
 how long we can stay in that pristine,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:57.880
 pristine and vastness spacious, free from the, any kind of grasping, clinging, how long we can stay

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:57.880
,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:05.880
 that long is absolute bodhicata, we maintain it, absolute bodhicata. So this is present time,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:12.600
 and the teaching said, at the, for example, you, we heard so many times, there is a five path,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:23.160
 accumulation path, and application path, and the seeing path, those are three paths,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:32.520
 it's first three path, and accumulation path, we, the absolute bodhicata, we intellectually

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:40.440
 understand it, intellectually understand the absolute bodhicata in the accumulation path,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:50.600
 and the application path, we will experience in the absolute bodhicata, and then seeing path,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:17:01.850
 then definitely, now we see the absolute bodhicata, but exactly as it is without the intellectually

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.280
,

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:09.880
 without experiencing, we see, first to first, that's what's called seeing path,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.080
 and we use that as a path, boomies, that's the path of boomies.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.200
 In order to reach that realization, and to continue with practices, what in the teachings,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:30.120
 that of course, to pull both relative bodhicata, absolute bodhicata, we have to do three things,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:41.800
 contrary to the teachers, and accumulating the merits, and continually practicing,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.760
 and the contract with the qualified teacher, as we discussed in that, teacher has a true

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.800
 in the teaching said, when you practically, outer teacher, inner teacher, outer teacher,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:02.040
 qualified teacher, as we discussed the other day, and of course, you all know that, inner teacher

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.120
 is

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:10.680
 what? Inner teacher is a compassion, inner teacher is a loving kindness, inner teacher is a wisdom,

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:20.280
 inner teacher is the devotions, enjoy, activated that teacher, teacher, so outer teacher,

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:29.320
 spiritual friend or teacher, contract in those, and inner teacher keep up

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:43.880
 the inner teacher, compassion, loving kindness, wisdom, also inner teacher, contract perfectly

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:53.880
 and beautifully according to your capabilities, outer teacher, and politely, respectfully,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:04.360
 with the keen, and with very, very genuinely, interesting, like to observe as all the great
