00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 Thank you, thank you friends, very much. It's always a celebration to come together, to reflect

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.240
 on the Dharma, to practice the Dharma together. And so when we really connect to the lineage,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.960
 and we ask the turning of the wheel of Dharma, we're actually asking ourselves to show up,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 like may my mind and my heart be available to connect to the Dharma right now. So that's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.480
 really kind of what we're asking. May I become receptive to be influenced by the truth of

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.720
 goodness, the truth of the nature, the truth of love and compassion and wisdom. So we're

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.320
 really trying to become very vulnerable, very flexibly receptive to the truth of interdependence

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.720
 of the Dharma. And so in this way, Venerable Kamparumache always teaches time and again

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.760
 at the beginning of every teaching, at the beginning of all their books, these three

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.800
 things we need to do to like open our hearts and our minds to become receptive to the Dharma,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.320
 to become a suitable vessel, to become able to have a single line of Dharma totally change

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.760
 our lives. There's always these three things. And with these three things, then everything

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 we experience will be like that. It will constantly, will be constantly reinvigorated by the truth

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 of the nature of the Dharma. These three things are renunciation, which is joy and appreciation.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.120
 The second is bodhicitta, genuine, heartfelt, courageous, love and compassion for all beings.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.280
 May every single being be free of suffering and the causes of suffering. May everyone

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.080
 realize their innate goodness, the innate goodness of everything beyond all conceptual

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.440
 designation and see this all the time, no matter what happens. And may I achieve enlightenment

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.800
 personally in order to help make this happen. This is bodhicitta, courageous, the ones courageous

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.440
 for enlightenment, the bodhisattvas. This is the heart of all things Mahayana, Sutra

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.360
 Mahayana and Tantra Mahayana. And then thirdly, more specific to Tantra Mahayana, when our

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.720
 mind actually rests in that awareness, this goodness of oneself, goodness of other, goodness

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.240
 of all situations and circumstances, when we really bravely allow ourselves to relax

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.960
 into that, then we have this, all of a sudden our sense doors relax and they get vividly

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.360
 functional. All of a sudden we get a lot, we get enhanced. So what's that like experientially?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.360
 The Buddha gave millions of Tantras on this. What's the enhancement when we really recognize

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.080
 and like let ourselves believe in our own Buddha nature, in the Buddha nature of all

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.440
 beings, pure body, pure speech, pure mind. They're called pure perception. Our sense

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.560
 doors soften, sharpen, open, extend, relax, get invigorated. We see pure form, pure sound,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.000
 pure speech, deity, mantra, Dharmakaya. This is pure perception. This is like foundational

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.240
 for every single Vajrayana, everything, all three of these. So at the beginning of any

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.640
 session when we study, contemplate, meditate, we really try to vividly make this a living

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.480
 reality, not just a belief that we like have that idea, I'm a good Buddhist so I'll believe

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.360
 these things. Instead we actually try to be a Buddha now, like actually connect to our

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.080
 Buddha nature now. And how do we do that? These three ways. Bring up surging wave of

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.800
 gratitude. How many things we have that are totally in our favor right now. And a surging

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.880
 wave of gratitude, a genuine heartfelt kindness and just bravery. No matter what happens,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.600
 no matter what it takes, I will stay to help every single being become free of suffering.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.680
 And then thirdly, there's not really some big fire to put out. That's actually not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:30.040
 true. Things are inherently good. So that's a very brave view. It's pure perception. All

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.920
 the nightmares, they're all dreams, they're like dreams. So we try to courageously allow

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:42.880
 ourselves to wake up, be in a non-dreaming mode, in a fully wakeful way, to be awakened

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.400
 right now. In this moment, then with these three things, try to turn on, activate, make

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:27.920
 a living. Thank you. So if we do these three things, then everything becomes a dharma. And

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480
 all the 84,000 teachings of the Buddha, they're all just oriented towards helping us make

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.520
 these three things be a living experience. Joy and appreciation, bodhicitta, and pure

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.560
 perception. These are three essential aspects of what it means to be enlightened, to be awakened.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.580
 That's what the Buddha said. That's what Guru Rinpoche taught. All these masters,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.700
 all the way to our very own teachers, Venerable Kenshin Pauldron Chair Rinpoche,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.720
 Venerable Kemba Sanandanya Rinpoche. So whatever it takes, whatever is a skillful way for us to

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 just remember and actually let the fullness of each of these points kind of resonate and transform

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.860
 ourselves, then that means we're actually living dharma. And not just kind of, you know, acting

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.160
 dharma, or pretending dharma, or kind of feel like if I'm, you know, all the ways that we cannot

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.280
 really let it sink in. But when we really let it touch us, the dharma is a living experience,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.040
 these three points as everything we need. And so then there's really countless ways to reactivate

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.120
 this, because then nature is a field of infinite interdependence. So all these things are just

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.840
 helping us remember, hey, you're interdependent. Hey, you're a part of this too. There's no fixed

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.800
 stuck part. Everything's going to be something actually designed to wake us up. And then it's

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.440
 a really a question of how receptive am I to receiving that wave as a reminder of dharma. So

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.000
 there's a million ways we can unpack this. And today, the topic that I thought of the other day,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.960
 just as a personal exploration, and then I just kind of share vocally, as a nobody, speaking to

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:13.800
 a camera with a room of lovely beings, but into the internet land that goes into who knows where,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:22.840
 for how long. So the topic for today, to echo out forever into infinity in digital world space,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:33.720
 is transcendental wisdom rainbow body. How to be uncompromising and flexible at the same time.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.360
 Transcendental wisdom rainbow body, how to be uncompromising and flexible at the same time.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:52.560
 So I've set the bar really high and said, let's see if I can jump off into that. And more it's

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.840
 like a giant cliff. And I get to jump off of it. You get to all watch me fall and splat. So maybe

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.600
 we'll fly for a minute and during the fall. Hopefully the wind will boost us a little bit.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.680
 There's so many ways to talk about this topic. And it's a very, I find it to be a very special

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.000
 topic.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.760
 Because in Buddhism, all these teachings in Sutra and Tantra, they all point we have to come to

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.800
 certainty wisdom about the truth of the Dharma. It's called in this clear mirror. I just was a

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.840
 friend of mine here, a song a member here. This is my big stack of Dharma treasures for today.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.360
 Just mentioned something we pulled a bibliomancy quote, randomly pull a Dharma book,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:51.040
 clear mirror, due to his secret biography. And it says this, once you apprehend the incisive

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.800
 certainty from deep within, that all phenomena of cyclic existence and enlightenment never

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:06.040
 transcend the nature of space. That is called pure space. So this is a random book page poll

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:16.560
 for today. Incisive certainty, certainty wisdom, no she or this certainty unwavering conviction

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:28.840
 in the truth. Okay, uncompromising. All these teachings are trying no matter what happens to

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:36.600
 us in any situation, even the most challenging difficult situations. We have an uncertainty,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:45.840
 or sorry, a an unwavering certainty and an incisive certainty or conviction. This is true.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:57.840
 That's where we're aiming with the Dharma to have unwavering certainty. That's really clear in the

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:06.560
 teachings. Then the question is, what does that mean? Uncertainty, or sorry, certainty, or certain

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:17.280
 conviction, an unwavering conviction. When, in what? And then we get the classic Buddhist answer,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:30.600
 it depends. Centered dependent. And so this is how I thought to explore this topic. Where we're

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.320
 trying to get to is transcendental wisdom rainbow body. All the highest teachings, they say that's

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.600
 the peak, that's the peak sign that we have attained full enlightenment. Not small enlightenment,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.720
 medium enlightenment, big enlightenment. Not our hot hood, Bodhisattva Bhumi hood, full unsurpassed

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.680
 enlightenment. Two omnisciences, you know, every single relative position of phenomena happening

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.360
 simultaneously without omission throughout the three times in the ten directions. That's relative

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:08.880
 omniscience and absolute omniscience. You see that the nature of every single part in that entire

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.330
 infinite inexhaustible web of interdependence cause, condition, and effect. You see the nature is

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:14.440
 the

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:21.640
 same all the time without omission or distortion. That's absolute omniscience. An indication that

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.440
 this is achieved is transcendental wisdom rainbow body, like Guru Rinpoche, the great master of

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:36.800
 Himalamitra. So this is quite a big topic. So as we ascend to that unsurpassed enlightenment,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.720
 that's what we're aiming to do. Boruchitta, may I achieve unsurpassed enlightenment in order to

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:50.880
 serve all beings the exactly perfect way so I can help them achieve unsurpassed enlightenment. And

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.120
 then we can just keep helping each other until every single being is free of suffering and the

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:05.880
 cause of suffering. So along that path, if we see it as a path, if I'm in the mind state that sees

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.240
 myself not there, and then the transcendental wisdom rainbow bodies where I have to get to,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.760
 then in between is a path. And if I'm in the mind state that things like that, then there's steps

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:15.960
 on

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.000
 this path is a sequence, right? This is a gradual approach to Buddhism. And that is always talked

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.280
 about in nimma school as the nine yanas, the nine vehicles, the nine levels or stages of study and

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.180
 practice. And here's where we can get a lot of refined detail about what are we having certainty

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:41.250
 conviction in? Because every single one of those yanas or vehicles has a definitive view,

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.700
 meditation,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:50.820
 conduct and fruition. This has just been repeated so many times by the Buddha, Guru Rinpoche, Long

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.920
 Champa, all these great masters, His Holiness Dalai Lama says, Mipham Rinpoche, His Holiness

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.480
 Dudra Rinpoche, Venerable Kemple Rinpoche, all these masters, they say these same things, these

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:00.760
 nine

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:06.690
 yanas have, they have a definitive view, meditation, conduct, and fruition, according to each level

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.040
. So

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.440
 you asked a different level, what's the certainty wisdom? They'll say, this is the absolute

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:12.840
 certainty

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.360
 wisdom of our view. And everything else is the relative skillful means to help establish that

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:27.120
 conviction. That's true for Yana one, Trivaka Yana, they have a definitive certainty conviction

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.160
 they're trying to achieve uncompromising, no matter what happens, this is the absolute truth. It's

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.610
 called definitive, definitive teaching of the Buddha, compared with the provisional or interpret

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:38.800
able

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:46.920
 teaching of the Buddha. So one is the act the final teaching, undistorted final teaching. And the

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.840
 other is all the skillful means, the supportive networks of circumstances that help us boost to

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.680
 see that for ourselves as a visceral, complete embodied full experience of the truth of that.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:05.040
 It's called provisional. So this is centuries of debate on what is provisional? What's definitive?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.200
 What is what should I do really be uncompromising about? And what should I be flexible about? What

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.200
's

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:18.200
 the skillful means? What's a wisdom? What's relative? What's absolute? This is a very big

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.920
 topic in Buddhism, between Buddhists, between lineages between schools within schools, a debate,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:33.840
 which means that an active inquiry doesn't mean a fight or a war. It means an exploration. Buddhism

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.720
 is a path of internal self revelation. We're disclosing more truth to ourselves with every

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.680
 step with every moment. That's what bodhicitta does. We reveal more of our Buddha nature, more

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.560
 of our self cognizant pristine awareness. Wisdom turns on, shines, it's not blocked. More truth

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:59.600
 becomes apparent to myself, to my mind, my own mind. I become more certain. And what is that?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.920
 My view includes more. And what does that like in terms of a scholar kind of way? All of a sudden,

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.520
 I go to another yana, another vehicle. Now I'm in a new view, meditation, conduct,

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.040
 fruition. And it has a new definition of what's definitive, and a new definition of what's

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.600
 provisional. And that goes all the way up until transcendental wisdom rainbow body, or the level

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:32.360
 of zogchen, up to yoga, the ninth yana, where they said there's no further to go. At that point,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.120
 we're not talking about a path anymore, stages and steps and concepts and ways of refining

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.720
 definitions, things to remove or add. It's not talking in that way anymore. It's a completely

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.300
 different mode. We're not talking about conditioned to mind, duality mind, trying to refine

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.760
 concepts

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:54.720
 anymore. It's talking just about wisdom awareness seen clearly with two omnisciences. Stably,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.280
 uninterruptedly, all the time, every single moment. That just means bodhicitta is on all the time,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:09.510
 in a Sutra Mahayana perspective. So there's so many ways to approach these. And so that's kind of

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:09.640
 the

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.000
 general container of holding that I'm holding this what's uncompromising and what's flexible.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.720
 What's a certainty wisdom, and what's a skillful means that supports us, my own mind, my own heart,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:29.200
 to self recognize that that that wisdom with certainty. And so there's layers or levels or

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:36.440
 openings, and foldings for the disclosement, more expansive revelation, a bigger aperture of more

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.280
 cause, condition, and effect that I'm including. There's a lot of different ways to talk about

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:48.800
 this. But that's kind of what we're talking about. And so one more is like a shout out. This is a

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:48.880
 new

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:55.480
 book my wife Amanda gave me recently. And I'm like, deliciously enjoying it. Notebooks of a

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:01.680
 wondering monk. It's like notebooks of Venerable and Mathieu Ricard. I was like, I just more or

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:01.960
 less

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.080
 wanted to mention this because it's a new book. And it's really like, oh, juicy stories of his

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:13.140
 life with all these great masters. But then I had to make it relevant to talking today. So page 241

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.280
,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:21.520
 he says, as our dear departed friend, the neuroscientist Francisco Varela once told me,

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:29.240
 the best attitude is to leave the door open to new answers on the question of the nature of mind.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:36.600
 The best attitude is to leave the door open to new answers on the question of the nature of mind.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:45.200
 So this is an open door inquiry. This is a personal exploration. That's why in Buddhism, debate,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.800
 study,

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:53.720
 and contemplation, they're all analysis and analytic method. Analysis means to loosen or set

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.920
 free. This is again and again repeated by the great Buddhist teacher, Elizabeth Matisse Namgyal,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:06.240
 to loosen or set free. That's the function of analysis, to open the aperture, to open the door

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:14.200
 of my awareness, my heart. So I feel more, I see more, I include more, I see things more clearly.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.800
 So

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:22.760
 it's not actually just a question of quantity more, but it's actually quality to more clearly. So

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:30.120
 both more and clearly. So without that, then the Dharma just becomes fundamentalism. It's not

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:37.960
 analysis, it's just belief. Just another blind belief. It's not liberative in that case, it may

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.120
 be really wholesome and healthy and oriented in the right direction. But it won't be liberative,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.640
 because in the end, beliefs aren't liberative. Just holding on to an idea is not liberative.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.640
 That's just having a concept. Study is really important. Having good concepts or finding

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.200
 concepts is crucially important. But the main point is to go beyond the limits of conceptual

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:05.400
 frameworks. That's called wisdom or jhana, or prajna, it depends. But to have wisdom is a lived

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:13.320
 experience, the definitive experience of wisdom. That's where we're kind of aiming towards. So

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:21.400
 analysis. What's definitive, what's provisional, what is flexible, and what is uncompromising.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.280
 In Rinpoche's book, Uprooting Clinging, commentary on mid-power Rinpoche's wheel of analytic

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:26.840
 meditation,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:35.240
 it's 58. I think I've read this before, but it's really, I think, very helpful for me.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:45.960
 Each aggregate form, feeling, perception, mental formation, consciousness, each aggregate, this is

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.160
 like core Buddhist teaching. Each aggregate appears like the reflection of the moon and water,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:58.440
 a mirage, or a banana tree. In each case, there's no essence, no solid existence. They're all based

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.760
 on impermanence. They exist in a momentary and changeable state. This investigation leads us to

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.080
 the conclusion the world of experience is an illusion. And since this world is an illusion,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.000
 there's no need to be attached. Attachment and clinging are foolish, unnecessary, and unwise.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.440
 If the world consists of nothing but the five aggregates, and they have no more reality than

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.840
 a reflection of the moon and water or a mirage, then all attachment must also be based on illusion.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:36.840
 Maintaining awareness of this nature is the practice of meditation. The result of a thorough

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:43.240
 and focused investigation is the development of definitive understanding. The perfect understanding

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.200
 we gain through the use of this mental analysis isn't something we need to believe in. This

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.960
 awareness is certainty wisdom. When we meditate in this way, using this analytic meditation,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.120
 old habitual patterns will continually activate clinging and attachment. But if we maintain the

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.920
 meditation, we'll clearly see that even birth and death are illusions. Birth and death are just

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.320
 habitual patterns. The continued application of this analytic meditation will eventually lead

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.720
 us to discover the transcendental wisdom rainbow body, or jalu, that is beyond habitual patterns.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.760
 In the Dzogchen teachings, there are many stories of how great masters developed such an elevated

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.480
 realization of the transparency of reality, based on their realization of the empty,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.840
 illusory nature of everything, that they can move through material objects. They could do this

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.320
 because they had actualized the true nature and thoroughly realized how apparent reality is

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.720
 constructed. The Tibetan phrase for the relative truth of how things appear is kunzob dempa,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.560
 or samvrta satcha in Sanskrit. The literal translation of this is the truth that is

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:57.560
 completely superficial, artificial, or unreal. Relative truth.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:04.920
 The process of investigating using this technique of analytic meditation is so important,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.360
 because it establishes a foundation upon which there can be proper development.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.400
 Without it, even if it appears that we're progressing, there will be difficulty later.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.480
 Any progress made without this foundation will eventually collapse.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.000
 The definitive understanding, or the view established by analytic meditation,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.640
 is to not be attached to any aspect of reality. Arriving at this state of awareness that is

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.640
 beyond attachment causes us to perceive everything as being in transit, moving, changing, and only

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:42.040
 manifesting on a temporary basis. From this point of view, it becomes also clear that when we no

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.240
 longer have attachment, anger will not develop in us. This is one of the principal understandings

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.320
 of

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:53.530
 Mahayana Buddhism. Renunciation doesn't mean being completely removed from the world. It simply

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:53.960
 means

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.720
 being detached. The Buddha left his royal palace to go into the jungle and meditate. That is one

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.000
 form of renunciation. But the more profound meaning of renunciation is having non-attachment

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.760
 that avoids clinging to worldly activities. Having no attachments is a much deeper form of ren

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.240
unciation

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.690
 than simply separating ourselves from objects of attachment. The whole idea or focus of ren

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:17.560
unciation

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.320
 is to attain a clear understanding of the state of non-attachment. When we have no attachment to

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.400
 worldly activities, the ideal of renunciation is realized. Then we can find enjoyment in every

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:36.840
 experience. So if we actually stabilize non-attachment, the result is we can enjoy everything.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:46.280
 Not that we enjoy nothing, which is quite a big difference.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:58.280
 This is so deep.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.000
 Okay, great. So we're doing this big, quick, fast sweep of Nanyanas.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:25.480
 So I'm going to sweep fast. But it's good. It's good to do. What I found is that if we don't have

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:33.560
 some basic fundamental frameworks, then it's so easy to get lost in the maze of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.880
 We've so kindly received these from great masters like Mipham Rinpoche.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.560
 And Venerable Kenshin Paul and Cher Rinpoche, Venerable Kenpo San Doenry Rinpoche, this is one

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:52.040
 of the main lineages they hold, the scriptural lineage of Mipham Rinpoche. Ken Rinpoche said this

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:59.800
 very clearly. So Mipham Rinpoche taught these essential frameworks very clearly. These Nanyana

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.950
 frameworks and the four philosophical schools, we need to have some of these basic bedrock

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:04.040
 teachings

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.960
 so that that's as a firm foundation for our analytic meditation. So then when all these old

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:16.320
 or hidden subtle habitual patterns come up, then we don't break or we don't also tighten and shrink

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.440
.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:23.640
 Then we can have a basic way of framing and holding so we have enough space in the room.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:31.880
 So the object of attention, this big arising, distracting, old habitual pattern comes up,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.360
 and that object doesn't fill up the whole room because we have more space than that because

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:43.160
 it's being held in a much bigger frame. So these are big frame discussions. So the Nanyanas,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.720
 there's always a relative and absolute truth. This is according to Mipham Rinpoche.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.960
 On relative truth, it's always subdivided into pure relative truth and impure relative truth.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:02.440
 Pure relative truth is where tantras begin. Impure relative truth is sutras.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:10.440
 So if we look at impure relative truth, impure relative truth is then subdivided into two.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.080
 Valid impure relative truth and invalid impure relative truth.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.480
 Valid relative truth, impure relative truth is how sentient beings see something in a way

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.520
 that helps them get to pure relative truth and absolute truth.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:36.440
 Invalid impure relative truth is a sentient being using a belief that just helps them stay more in

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:43.640
 some sorrow. Just to believe it's just not helpful, it's just another layer of karmic habitual

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.280
 obscuration that makes us more closed off to being receptive to being changed to influence by

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:53.800
 the dharma. So then we're talking specifically, there's these two types. There's sentient mind

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.560
 that has beliefs and concepts that help it wake up and be free and that don't help it wake up and

00:26:59.560 --> 00:26:59.800
 be

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:07.240
 free. So in the category of the invalid impure relative truth, sentient stuff that just doesn't

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:16.920
 help, there's four types. This is in Gurumache's Garland of Views. Four general categories of what

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.000
 seems definitive to each of these views. See if you can relate to it. I definitely can relate to

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.360
 all four. One, materialism. What's materialism basically? Technically, according to Gurumache.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:37.240
 Why is the sky blue? You plant the seed, it grows into a thing. So when I ask you those questions,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:46.440
 the materialist is like, "Eh, this is boring. I'm gonna go watch TV." Those questions just

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:52.040
 aren't interesting. It's just what's right, what's happening right around me. This is called

00:27:52.040 --> 00:28:00.040
 materialist. Cause, condition, and effect, it's just not very interesting. Materialist, hedonist.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:07.720
 Second, why is the sky blue? Why is good things having a bad people, bad things having a good

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:15.240
 people? It's kind of interesting, but I'm really probably trying to do what feels good to me right

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:23.960
 now. So hedonist is mainly trying to make this life pretty much just nice, comfortable according

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.320
 to what they want. And those deeper questions about cause, condition, and effect, maybe it

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.680
 sparks a little something, but not much. They're more interested in just having a good time.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:44.120
 I can totally relate to that too. Again, what's on TV? Not even say TV now, Netflix. They wanted

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.240
 me to say Netflix, not only to say Metaverse. And they wanted me to say, "I'm watching it." They'll

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.760
 be like, "Which world system are you in the Metaverse?" But anyway, it's about to get really weird.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:29:03.000
 Third, nihilists. Nihilists, they believe in cause and condition and effect only as far as they can

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.760
 see, hear, touch, taste, and think. So they'll believe in cause, condition, and effect, but only

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.400
 so far is a gross, apparent reality. The more subtle levels of causation that might be there,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:26.600
 they don't believe it. Gotta see it to believe it, right? They're seeing is a very specific range

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:26.760
 of

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.840
 things. There's all kinds of things. The great Master's Oxford, Ken Sirimiche often talks about

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:38.100
 this as rationalism, empiricism. We talk about this as modernism, the European age of enlightenment

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.440
.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.720
 There's all kinds of different ways. Some people just call it science, as if that's not talking

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.280
 about it as a religion, because which science? There's a lot of sciences and they've changed

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.560
 almost every science before this century has been wrong. And it's going to be the same with this

00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:00.440
 science right now. So yeah, empiricism, rationalism, what my cognitive sense doors,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:07.480
 how far they go, beyond that, not interested. Or I have certainty, conviction that it's not true,

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:13.560
 it's wrong, it doesn't exist, it's a baby belief, it's superstition, whatever, you insert your

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:20.840
 rationalization. So that's called nihilist. Tinley Norburn, but she talks about this a lot in white

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:27.960
 sale. The fourth one is eternalist. So you have a subtler apprehension or kind of appreciation

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.880
 for cause, condition, and effect. But when the deeper questions come, like where did this all

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.760
 come from? What is the meaning of life? What happens after we die? These are subtle things

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.720
 you can't just see in a telescope. Even with logic, there's different logic systems and

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.360
 they'll have different ways of engaging that inquiry and they'll come to different conclusions.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:55.480
 So the eternalist, they always answer those deeper, subtle, quiet,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.880
 really less apparent questions. They answer it according to their belief system.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:08.200
 Where did this come from? Insert your belief system answer. Where do we go after we die?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:15.160
 Insert belief system answer. So they believe in cause, condition, and effect up to a point,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:21.240
 but when you really get down to subtle cause, they insert a belief. When you get into subtle

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.040
 cause, they insert an effect. At the end, they say you just have to have faith.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:35.000
 Right? And so what's the difference between that faith and certainty wisdom? That's where as a

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.320
 Buddhist, we need to be really careful that I'm not being a fundamentalist Buddhist. I'm actually

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:45.160
 being an active living, living Dharma Buddhist practitioner. Really trying to see for myself,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:51.160
 learn the teachings, and see the chain of cause, condition, and effect. Because that's what defines

00:31:51.160 --> 00:32:00.600
 Buddhism. A full range exploration of cause, condition, and effect. All the way back, beginning,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.360
 beginning, beginning, beginning, and, and, and, and, and wide, small, micro, meso, macro, like the

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.760
 whole

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:13.880
 range of interdependence. That's the field of play of Buddhism. And so here we get into valid

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:22.200
 impure relative truth. And what constitutes valid impure relative truth? In Buddhist terms,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:30.840
 it's a path of liberation. A view is considered valid if it leads you towards liberation,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.720
 freedom from suffering and the causes of suffering. That's what considered valid.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:42.360
 So it's leading me towards absolute truth. You could talk about it like that. And all the different

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.440
 yanas, they would talk about it like that. It's leading to absolute truth or ultimate realization,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.880
 how things are, not just how they appear. Not just relatively how they appear. Ultimately,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:33:00.600
 how are they definitively when seen in an unmistaken way? So this is valid impure relative

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.880
 truth. How sentient beings see things when they're on a path, using frameworks, concepts, study,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:13.240
 contemplation to directly experience and fully integrate wisdom, which is liberative.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:22.520
 So then the wisdom in that context is what is definitive or what we can't compromise.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.880
 But as I said before, each yana, our vehicle has a different answer to what is the definitive

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:37.240
 wisdom. And so here, now we're in this, now we're in Buddhism. Then there's nine of these.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.840
 Nine answers of what is provisional, what's definitive? What do we not compromise?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:50.120
 What do we be flexible on? So this is how Buddhism is very non-dogmatic. Buddhism is

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:58.360
 self-composting. In the end, the system dismantles itself. But we shouldn't dismantle the system

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.970
 too early. Because if we're still on the path, and we need more steps, and we think we're at the

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:04.200
 goal,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.440
 but we're actually on the path, then all of a sudden we can get in a position where we have no

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.200
 more steps, but we're not at the goal. And that's really a hard place to get out of, because we

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.680
 think we're there and enlightened maybe, but we're not really there. So Maitreya said, "Of all the

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.800
 desires we give up, of all the concepts we give up, the goal and desire for enlightenment is the

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:31.480
 final one we stop believing in." It's the last one, not the first. If we give up enlightenment

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.000
 as a goal early, and we're not enlightened, then we kind of, our path gets really wonky hard.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.120
 It's basically a pathless path that we can't change anything about ourselves,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.960
 but we're still really deluded. So then that's really hard to undo that.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:35:01.480
 Great. So here's another new book, Mipham Rinpoche, "Gesar" book.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.720
 And this is a forward by Zogg-Sarkhan Siddhartha Rinpoche.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.240
 And it's a forward, so it doesn't require transmission.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:14.280
 Great. By Zogg-Sarkhan Siddhartha Rinpoche.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.400
 Human beings with all of their confusions, delusions, and self-righteous moralizing

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:28.280
 have relied to some extent on empirical research from time immemorial. Today, empiricism is the

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:34.440
 norm. If a phenomena cannot be validated or legitimized by reputable academics, perhaps at

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.040
 Oxford, or sorry, at Oxbridge or Ivy League University, it is labeled with a carefully

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:46.920
 crafted literary term like magical realism or legend and relegated to a pile of quaint,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:53.560
 old-fashioned archaic beliefs. If it is validated, if a famous academic or scientific institution

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.360
 gives it their seal of approval, everyone else feels safer about using it and won't feel

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.240
 embarrassed about sharing it with others. But no matter what tools are applied during the process

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:12.600
 of legitimization, an experiencer, enjoyer, decider is a must. And the rather vague term we use to

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:20.360
 describe that experiencer is mind. Curiously, empiricists don't appear to have noticed that

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.400
 no matter where mind is, with a shaman in a remote jungle in Peru or a nerdy scientist in a

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:27.880
 Cambridge

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:35.240
 lab, mind is necessarily an unstable conditioned phenomena that falls victim to causes and

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:41.160
 conditions at the drop of a hat. All it takes is an impatient word from a disgruntled spouse over

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.640
 breakfast, or the wrong choice of salad dressing at lunch, and mind flip-flops from happy to sad,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:56.040
 kind to cruel, easygoing to outraged. Yesterday, I was on the phone, and I didn't have like a

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.440
 headset phone. I had a phone, and I like put the phone, and I was like this with the phone,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:07.000
 talking on the phone for way too long because I had to write. And I went to stand up after that,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.840
 and I almost fell over. And for the whole rest of the night, I had vertigo. And I just had to go to

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:21.640
 sleep. Like it was like couldn't stand upright. Literally just my head was like that for too long,

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:28.680
 and all of a sudden I can't even stand. Such an influenceable condition, the puny little,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:34.600
 so fragile being. So fragile. It's just like moving the body in a position for like a little

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:42.280
 bit, and then I can't even walk. We're so influenceable. Oh, I can't have my coffee in

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.120
 the morning. Oh, I can't. I have my day. You know, like I can't, you know, I eat too much. Oh,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:55.160
 it's like so I'm okay. So that just means such a victim. It's so easy to be a victim. Anyway,

00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:02.600
 so that just means my sense of definitive, what is true, what's uncompromising is really weak.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:08.840
 Because if all of a sudden it's all falling apart, and I freak out, then I don't have any

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:15.000
 definitive or uncompromising. There's no ground I can rely on. I'm just reacting.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.040
 And so Buddhism is designed to not just be in a reactive mode all the time.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:26.330
 Because then we're just like any thing that comes in front of us, we are, oh, yeah, it's just like

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:26.520
 a

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:32.360
 kid, like a little kid. We have no self agency, no autonomy, then how are we going to be courageous

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.920
 to help all beings be free of suffering? All the, we've seen a little glimpse of the horrors of

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.520
 samsara right now. We're using all these really luxurious technologies in a warm room with

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:48.520
 full bellies and all that we have no idea what the horrors of samsara are like. I don't all these

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.440
 hell realms and things it's like, if we had a glimpse of them, we would just be shattered into

00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:03.080
 1000 pieces like put a chin Rizzi. But we don't, I get upset if my coffee is not hot enough.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:10.040
 Very weak, very weak mind. My mind's very weak.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.680
 So that's why the path is really important because liberation is just not talk.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:23.480
 Doesn't really do much to just have a patchy, they call it patchy,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.640
 patchy realization, sometimes a rainbow mouth.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:33.720
 Doesn't help to just patch on patch on idea of liberation on a belief system that's totally

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.400
 corrupt. It's just window dressing. It doesn't really do anything when the times get tough.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:45.720
 It just falls off. That's why we need a certainty conviction when the times get tough. These times

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.720
 are getting tough. They're getting tougher. They're going to get a lot tougher. There's a

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.560
 kind of very visceral experience. I think more people are having that the opportunity to prepare

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:02.920
 for emergency is shrinking. Now it's getting to be emergency. And in a lot of places in the world,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:09.880
 they're in that emergency already. They're prep times over in so-called first world industrialized

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:16.360
 places. We're just scared that that'll happen to us. A lot of these countries, it's always been

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.600
 like

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:23.080
 that. They're already post-apocalyptic. All these indigenous, look at the Tibetans, they're already

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:29.560
 in post-apocalyptic times. They're not waiting for the world to end. Their world ended. It was

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.040
 crushed.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.840
 But look at them, how courageous they are, how forgiving. They're still bodhicitta. They still

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:45.400
 care. They're still so curious, so kind. Look at what that system of liberation is doing for them

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.800
 as a people. As millions of people, different people, totally different people. It's not just

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.640
 homogenous group, same person. It's so varied people. How resolutely confident and courageous

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:05.560
 this path of awakening is for them as a general culture. It's really just astounding that such a

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:11.000
 culture in the millions exists when we're trying to think about, oh, how can we deal with these

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.800
 big meta-crisis and all these large-scale problems and all that. There's already been cultures for

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.440
 centuries where you have millions of people intentionally go out of their way to not kill

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:34.040
 bugs. This has been figured out. We've done, look at the Jains. This is not some, just because

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.800
 like a lot of tech bro, white investor guys haven't recognized or heard about bodhicitta,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:46.040
 it doesn't mean it hasn't done here. There's cultures that are grounded and based in bodhicitta

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:52.440
 for centuries now. There's all these books, millions of tantras on bodhicitta. How do you

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.880
 design a culture of enlightenment culture? They've been doing this for centuries.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:05.080
 And now we're going to rely on Mark Zuckerberg to figure it out for us.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:12.120
 Good luck with that. Good luck. He's not going to figure it out. Bodhicitta is the answer.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.160
 With all these things we experience, bodhicitta is the answer. You have electricity, bodhicitta.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.480
 You don't have electricity, bodhicitta. It's the answer. This is the one universal answer. This is

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:28.120
 the definitive truth. This is the uncompromising, unwavering thing. And so all the nine yanas are

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:37.480
 just teaching on bodhicitta. Relative bodhicitta, absolute bodhicitta. Then the super whirlwind for

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.280
 philosophical system, if we go from flexibility to uncompromising, relative to absolute, what do we

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:48.440
 need to be skillful about? What do we need to be clear and unwavering about? One, first, the root

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.880
 cause of all this troublesome sara is the sense of me. I'm the most important thing in the whole

00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:01.240
 world. I'm the same me today and I'm better than you. That's the root cause. First thing to do is

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:07.960
 recognize the selflessness of that. It is an interdependent condition, dependently arisen,

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:14.680
 mere appearance. It's just aggregates. These multiplicity of things coming together

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:22.120
 and aggregating and we falsely think that that is a singular me. That false reification,

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:28.920
 the false kind of like illusory, artificial glazing over of all the nuance into a sense of

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.360
 me that's more important than everyone, that is the thing that has to be definitively recognized

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:42.680
 in the shravakayana for the, what's it called? Vibhashika school, exposition school.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:53.080
 Relatively, everything's dependently arisen. Ultimately, I am selfless. There is no fixed me.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.560
 And what do they call that? They're irreducible dharmas.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:06.920
 Teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny, partless particles of mind, space, and time. That's their definitive

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:12.920
 or ultimate uncompromising position. They believe in these partless particles. What current

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:18.520
 modern science is looking for a theory of everything, an irreducible theory of everything.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:25.160
 So this is the Buddhist version of that in the Vibhashika school. There's micro, micro, teeny,

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.520
 tiny, irreducible. You cannot break them further, unbreakable. Partless particles of time,

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:38.200
 space, and mind. This is the ultimate uncompromising view in the shravakayana for, sorry,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.600
 the exposition school. So then, okay, I believe that. But say I don't believe that. Why? And

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.040
 that's what I failed to say so far. And then I'm going to wrap this up and we'll go practice.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:54.120
 Why? Why would I look at that view further? Why wouldn't I just stop and be like, that is a

00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:00.760
 sophisticated view. If I got the Nobel prize for actually finding the theory of everything that

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.280
 unites strong, weak nuclear force with gravity and electromagnetism, I feel like I would probably

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:15.240
 just chill after that. I wouldn't look further. That's like what no one in that range of scientific

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:21.000
 endeavor has ever come across. Like that would be a good life's work. But so why to go further?

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.760
 More? Is there more definitive? And that's the drive of sukramahayana. What serves?

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.520
 Does that help all beings be free of suffering? It might help some. It might help a lot,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.640
 but does it help all? And so I have to keep looking.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:49.320
 What serves better? What serves now? What is helpful now? That's the drive that leads in

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:56.520
 uncompromising certainty to open, to see its contextualization. That it too is a conceptual

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:04.680
 view that's held in place by beliefs. That's how a definitive understanding of one yana opens into

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:12.040
 become a provisional, a provisional truth in the next yana. So okay, so why would I do that?

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.600
 Irreducible particles of time, space, and mind. How would I do that? The next level of

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.320
 philosophical

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:26.760
 school says that sounds good, but how would I know it? Because they fundamentally posit mind and

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.320
 body

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.040
 material and non-material is two separate things. They're different in kind. So how could they ever

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:38.360
 interact? So what you get in that view is there are these universal, there are these particular

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:44.360
 things, these irreducible kind of partless particles of time, space, and mind. But all we

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.600
 ever see of it is a mental, conceptual map that maps onto it. So all we ever have direct contact

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:57.480
 with is our idea of what's actually ultimately true. We never have direct contact with what's

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.770
 actually irreducibly true. So it's a representational theory of mind, correspondence theory of mind

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.960
.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:11.160
 All we ever engage with is our mapping of this irreducible ultimate reality that's

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:17.640
 essentially not material. Sorry, it's material and there's not material. So not material

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.400
 can interface with the not material. The material can interface with the not material. So there's

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.400
 always like this kind of like corresponding thing where they can't exactly touch because they're

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:34.200
 different in kind. That's the idea. So then mind only school, the next one comes and says,

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:42.440
 but that's how do we know that's true? And what they say is it's not true. That's not definitive.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:49.160
 It's provisional. What's definitively true in mind only school chitamatra is it's only mind.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:58.430
 You have a mental idea of mental expression. It's just mental stuff. So they say there's three

00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.760
 kinds,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:05.160
 imaginary, dependent, arisen and true nature. These are all bedrock Buddhist frameworks that

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.840
 Rinpoche's have taught so many times that all these masters teach, that all these shedras teach,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.960
 that even if we're not going to become a scholar, we should know this stuff basically.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:19.160
 Because this is like a synthesizing something in 20, it's like a 20 minute TED talk instead of

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:25.720
 10 years of becoming a Kenpo or Kenmo. This is a really super condensed cartoon version.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:35.160
 So there's illusory or the imaginary, the Kuntag, Xianhuang, Londrup. Kuntag is imaginary.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:42.360
 Xianhuang is dependent origination, dependently arisen and Londrup or Yondrup is a true nature.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:52.920
 This is mind only school formatting. Imaginary is things like me. They say it's a complete fiction.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.800
 There is no referent in reality that corresponds to that. It's an utter fabrication.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:06.040
 They say it's like a horn of a rabbit. They also give examples like cable, house.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:14.600
 It's all imaginary. All this stuff we think is so we're so worried about.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.280
 It actually doesn't even point to anything that's there.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:26.280
 So Buddhism is deep. So then, okay, then what's next? Dependently origination.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:32.200
 They say that's actually what's there that's interacting in pattern sequences of cause,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.200
 condition and effect. Okay, so then there's impure relative truth, pure relative truth.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.000
 So that's something that can be either way and pause that. And then there's true nature.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.480
 True nature is how does the mind see dependent origination, the dependent part without mistake.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.800
 So they believe there is a non-dual mind that sees that clearly without mistake.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:03.960
 And so it's only mind experiencing itself. And some of what mine creates is utter fiction.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:11.400
 And some of what mine creates is actual patterns of interactivity. And the mind that sees the

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.840
 patterns of interactivity without any error is called true nature or non-dual mind.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:25.640
 This is mind only school. Then, Midway Manyamaka, they say that's provisional.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:34.520
 That's just an idea. It's just a belief. It's just dogma. Show me true nature mind.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:41.560
 Show me. Where is it? Find it. Which part of the body? Which part of the mind? Where? What's its

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:49.160
 shape, size, color? If it's a thing there, like to show me. I want proof. So Midway Manyamaka says

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:55.080
 that the definitive understanding of Midway Manyamaka view is empty of inherent existence.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:02.760
 That's uncompromising view. Relatively, everything is dependently originating.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:08.120
 Everything. There's no ground. There's no birth, no death. That's why they say the

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.120
 three liberations. Empty cause, empty result, empty no characteristics.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.200
 There's so many teachings on this. In general, it's called emptiness.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:27.160
 Lack of inherent existence. Then the other kind of way to talk about Midway Manyamaka school is

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:34.120
 beyond conceptual designation. Not designated by anything, even to say it's empty.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:42.520
 We're not designating an it, a type of being, or a quality it has of being empty. We're not in a

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.720
 mind that designates like that. They call it wisdom mind. They actually don't call it anything,

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:53.800
 like Prasankaka Midyamaka. They just refute any kind of option you put on the table,

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:59.800
 because they don't establish any position. Their definitive kind of view is no view,

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:05.640
 because they show how every view includes a fundamental contradiction or absurdity.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:10.280
 They're all concepts or self-contradictory if you look closely enough. If you analyze and loosen

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:18.200
 them, open them enough, they self-destruct. Concepts, they only go so far. So this becomes

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:24.520
 the bedrock of Tantra. Emptiness. This is called second turning or wrong tongue. Empty of self,

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:30.040
 empty of self-fixation or self-identity or conceptual designation. Empty of that. That's

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:36.440
 called a thorough selflessness of self and other. So then this is the basis of Tantra.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:41.000
 So now we're in, now this is third Yana. So this is all that we've talked about.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.800
 The Vibhāśika school, Sātrāntaka school, mind-only school, middle way,

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.760
 middle way, Madhyamaka. That's the first three Yanas in Nyingma Buddhism. First three vehicles.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:03.720
 Yana four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. That's all Tantra. So that's what this Dujum Teresanandra

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:03.720
,

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.880
 this is assuming this is, we know this stuff. Like when we do Dujum Teresanandra, like these are

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.840
 bedrock things. It's assuming we like kind of should get some degree of usefulness. Why? Because

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.640
 we're trying to get more and more kind of clear on what serves, serves to do what? Liberate self,

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:26.520
 liberate other. Liberate myself from that false imaginary sense of a me being the most important

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:31.480
 thing in the world and liberate other. Like what are the skillful means? It's support, like really

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:37.960
 helps someone else kind of lift the burden of them having that mistaken view too. And the most

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:43.720
 skillful, subtle, accurate, like really supportive uplifting ways possible. That's like actually

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.120
 effective skillful means. But here I'll mention this one thing and then we'll go into the practice.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:55.320
 This book is amazing. Douglas Duckworth. Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of mind and nature. Douglas

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:01.880
 Duckworth is brilliant. He's like Mipham Rinpoche scholar. It's crazy how smart he is in terms of

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:13.240
 synthesizing all these things. So I'm really so impressed. He's just amazing. And he's really

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.880
 overlooked because he's so quiet and humble. He's a student of Chikanyama Rinpoche and he's so

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.360
 quiet. He's like a soft, quiet practitioner, which means he's like more reliable.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:27.640
 He doesn't have a, I don't think he has a webpage or anything.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:38.680
 Yeah, good. So here's one. In this book, 129, the central place of embodied personal knowledge here

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:45.480
 as an active living truth contrasts sharply with the modern ideal of disinterested knowledge or

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:51.960
 impersonal faceless facts. Indeed for Buddhists, transformative knowledge is the most important

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:58.360
 kind of knowledge there is. The supposition that valueless, dead ideas, static truths

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:04.570
 are the only real truths there are is what Donald Evans is referred to as the dogma of impersonal

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:05.000
ism.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.840
 He characterized impersonalism as the dogmatic rejection of any claim that requires personal

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:19.400
 transformation to be adequately understood and appraised. Moreover, disinterested, impersonal

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:26.040
 facts are arguably never completely separate from personal interests and values. An implication of

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:32.920
 this is there can be no real distinction between facts and values, nor between domains of ontology

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.680
 and ethics. And this is as true for the orientation of science as it is for Buddhism.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.120
 So the simple way to say this, and this is a big old philosophy book that's actually really

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:51.400
 easy to read compared to most philosophy in my experience, is that everything, like anything of

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:56.200
 what's of most value is wisdom, and wisdom to get there is you have to undergo a process of

00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:01.480
 transformation. And transformation means I totally have to put my own ideas and beliefs and values

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:08.440
 on the line to be changed and interpreted and basically seen if they're true or not. And that

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:14.680
 means I have to fully engage it as a subjective, intersubjective, objective, interobjective

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:20.920
 experience. This is a full-on investigation, not just the empirical objective part of it,

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:26.760
 but the full-on experience of a lived reality as a person in a world with moving stuff.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:32.600
 So it has to be transformative. And then here, because otherwise wisdom doesn't happen,

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:38.200
 it's just belief. That's just study contemplation. Belief is just study and contemplation, not

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.760
 liberative. Prajna, or wisdom, is actually transformative. And here, there's one other

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:50.120
 thing again by Duckworth, and this is so awesome. This is where he gets to Tantra. And then we'll

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:58.040
 go to practice Tantra. This is from his book. This is a book I just exited. So this is in

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:04.600
 Douglas Duckworth, Jungang Mipham, His Life and Times. This book is so amazing. From 2011,

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:10.280
 it's now getting old, too. It's really, really good. And I excerpted it here. He's talking about

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:15.220
 what Tantra is. So here, we've gotten all the way to emptiness of self and others. Now we're saying

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:15.240
,

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:21.880
 well, what's next? This is third turning, where we establish Buddha nature as the definitive,

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:27.480
 uncompromising position. Everything else is a skillful, flexible means to get to that.

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.520
 Level of position, that level of kind of nuance or flexibility. So here, he talks about this.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.360
 This is awesome. And then we'll go to practice.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:45.160
 Enigma, let me make sure this is the right one. Yeah. Okay. This is wild.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:50.680
 Enigma presentations of philosophical systems, which we did just a minute ago,

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.080
 and it was really clunky and bad. Enigma presentations of philosophical systems,

00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:01.800
 the view does not culminate in the consequent school of the middle way, but ascends through

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:08.840
 the Tantras. Another character of the Enigma tradition is to present internal distinctions

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:14.200
 with the views of different Tantras. In the same way that a hierarchy of four philosophical

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:19.640
 systems in Sutra, the great exposition school, Sutra school, mind only, and middle way,

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:25.810
 in the same way that this hierarchy is represented as an ascending scale with each level transc

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:26.040
ending

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:33.960
 the limitations of the previous one, the hierarchy of views extends through the Tantras. Thus,

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:40.680
 Tantra is treated as the next paradigm that resolves the shortcomings of the preceding level,

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:47.240
 which is the consequent school, while incorporating its insight. In this way, Tantra marks a

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:47.960
 distinct

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:54.200
 philosophical horizon for the Enigma tradition, and here's where it gets really good. In Mipham's

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:59.320
 works, the hierarchy of views of the four philosophical systems appears to be based

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:06.120
 on an internal principle of emptiness as ineffability. The higher the view, the more

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:12.520
 increasingly ineffable reality is acknowledged to be. In this way, he presents the philosophical

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:19.000
 systems of the causal vehicle of Sutra as a hierarchy based on the empty quality of reality.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.440
 The higher the view, the more comprehensive the representation of emptiness.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:32.360
 The four philosophical systems thus primarily reflect an analytic approach. The increasingly

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.920
 eminent purity of reality, however, seems to be the internal logic guiding the hierarchy of views

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:46.600
 within the resultant vehicle of Tantra. As such, Tantra's hierarchy is oriented more towards an

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:54.520
 experiential dimension rather than an analytical one. In the context of the four or six classes of

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.720
 Tantras, we can see how the hierarchy shifts from the principle of increasing transcendence,

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:07.880
 emptiness, as it is in Sutra, to the principle of eminence. That is, the higher the view,

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:14.840
 the more wisdom becomes an imminent reality. Mipham generally distinguishes the hierarchy

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.720
 of all the Buddhist teachings in both the philosophical systems of Sutra in the causal

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.720
 vehicle and the classes of Tantra in the resultant vehicle based on a hierarchy of gradual to

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.120
 sudden.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.560
 That is, the higher the view, the more sudden the process of realization.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:43.000
 So this is cool. The Sutra view is an ascending hierarchy of seeing emptiness more fully.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.600
 The Tantra then takes that up as an ascending hierarchy of seeing the purity of relative

01:00:52.600 --> 01:01:03.880
 reality more fully. So instead of just saying it's empty of being fixated or stuck, then that gets

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.280
 to

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.760
 middle way school. And on top of that, in addition to that, what happens once we're not stuck in

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:17.240
 fixation? The imminent purity of experience starts becoming self-evident to ourselves. And what's

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:17.400
 that

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:24.440
 called? Pure body, pure speech, pure mind. And so the ascending Bhumi paths, like when we get into

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.560
 Tantra practice of Bhumis, all of a sudden it's talking about deity, mantra, and Dharmakaya.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.120
 Whereas in the Sutra, they're not talking about that. They're just more pointing towards

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:40.200
 the empty quality of experience. The Tantras then, based on the empty quality of experience,

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:47.640
 open the imminent realization of the purity of all phenomena. So that's why in Kriya Tantra,

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.640
 you get a pure deity that you line up with through all these practices, and you get blessed,

01:01:53.640 --> 01:02:00.840
 and then you become pure. And then in Upa, you're seen more as like the deity is an equal to you,

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.560
 but you have to still line up to the deity, which is pure. You line up and then you're pure too.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:14.520
 And then Kriya, Upa, Yoga, Yogayana, then it's doing a view where it's pure, more like friends.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.320
 Like you're not seeing as a hierarchy of like their pure and you're not. You're seeing it as

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.560
 I'm pure, you're pure, but you still have to do these ascetic practices to establish that view.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.000
 Then you get to inner Tantras, Maha Yoga, Anu Yoga, Ata Yoga. Maha Yoga says it's all pure.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.360
 Form is pure, sound is pure, space is pure, and that's when they start talking about deity,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.880
 mantra, and dharmakaya. This is a creation stage, visualization practice. This is where it's

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:51.800
 emphasizing a pure mandala. I'm a deity, everyone's a deity doing enlightened activities. Then Anu

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:59.880
 Yoga deepens the purity. Not only is outside pure, my whole inner system is like nested matrices of

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.880
 enlightened mandalas of deities doing deity activities. Then in addition to that, Dzogchen

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:13.640
 says don't use any method to establish that view, because that's that Anu Yoga is completion stage

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:19.720
 with characteristics, using supports like salong tumo, these certain things, using these very rapid

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.840
 skillful means supports to activate the realization of outer purity and inner purity. So this is

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.000
 the

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.080
 eminent purity becoming more self-evident. Dzogchen says don't use those supports. It's an effort

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:31.320
less

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:37.960
 path. You recognize non-conceptual wisdom awareness as the path. So this is the highest resultant

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:43.880
 vehicle, and then you allow that recognition, the total sudden view that everything's already

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.890
 accomplished to just naturally manifest itself. Let's call it the path of liberation, self-liber

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:50.120
ation.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.920
 It undoes itself. It kind of shows its own effulgence or whatever its nature by itself

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:02.760
 without you having to do anything. So that's the definitive view in Dzogchen. And then as a final

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:12.040
 note, that Dzogchen definitive view means it includes all the subviews. Why? Because what serves

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:19.400
 best? It's not just self-liberation, it's other liberation. So Dzogchen includes all of the other

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:26.600
 methods and view meditation, conduct, fruition. It includes all of them, and it always activates

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:32.990
 its responsiveness based on what's helpful. What's helpful for me to wake up, what's helpful for

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.160
 the

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.320
 other to wake up, and it does that seamlessly, effortlessly. They call it spontaneously. And then

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.440
 it activates that view, meditation, conduct, fruition, held within an effortless responsiveness.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:52.120
 So then you get a great completion, great perfection. So it's not effortless in all the

01:04:52.120 --> 01:05:00.360
 gradual stuff's bad. Effortless in all the gradual stuff is done effortlessly. So then it doesn't,

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.800
 it becomes a fully inclusive view as a lived experience instead of a cognitive way to talk

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:11.990
 yourself out of having to do any work on the path, which isn't a path. It's just called samsara.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.680
 And

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:17.800
 then it's like the worst kind of possible position you can be in samsara. Because you, anyway, for

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:23.330
 all the things I've said before about it. So that's the basic thing about how Buddhism isn't dog

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:23.880
matic

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:31.720
 when it's done properly. Because it's a self-composting system. Like what is uncompromising? It

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.120
 depends on what helps, what helps my mind wake up, what helps your mind wake up, what helps the

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.240
 context be more flourishing and nutritious for beings to naturally wake up, for bodhicitta to

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:49.800
 shine on. What helps do that? That's the definitive position in this context. And anything that

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:56.360
 supports that I can be flexible with. Anything and everything. So that's where you get transcend

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:56.600
ental

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:02.840
 wisdom rainbow body. Transcendental wisdom rainbow body is where there's no longer a sense of

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:10.840
 fixation on of any position being held. All you are is a seamless responsive, like a seamless

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:18.280
 responsitivity. Like all you do is seamlessly sync up with large webs of interactivity in whatever

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.240
 way is helpful. As medicine, as a bridge, as a boat, as a mantra, as silence, as a nice memory,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:32.360
 as a breeze, as anything. And all the habitual patterns of mind, body, speech that we've

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:41.240
 reified over countless time. That's all loosened with analysis and actual transformative practice.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:48.440
 So that it's dissolved into its pure natural energetic responsiveness as buddha nature. And

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:54.760
 so all it does is like that's rainbow body, jalu. That's why gurimbatshe can appear in any form.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:00.120
 In any time. That's why when we recite the seven line prayer, they say that is gurimbatshe.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:06.280
 Or we visualize gurimbatshe. That is gurimbatshe. Or we look at our hand. That is gurimbatshe.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:13.560
 Or you listen to someone battle on and on again. That's gurimbatshe. It's all gurimbatshe. This is

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:20.120
 the absolute definitive view from this highest yoga tantra from Zogchen. Everything is gurimbatshe.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.120
 Outside is gurimbatshe. Inside is gurimbatshe. Secret is gurimbatshe. Ultimate is gurimbatshe.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:34.200
 It's all gurimbatshe. And so then that you can say is it's all the guru. And so then that's why

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:39.880
 we use one teacher as a guru to help us see that. It's easier using that with one person who's so

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.330
 primed to be accomplished in study practice. So we use them because they really will help us see

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:45.720
 that

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:51.930
 in them. Then they'll help us see that in me. Then they'll help us see that in everything. And that

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:52.120
's

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:58.280
 called zogchen. That this has all always been the guru. And then we spontaneously start just

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.400
 oh we support beings to help them see this is the goodness is everywhere. This is pure relative

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:11.400
 truth in union with great equality. So I hope that's helpful. I said a lot of things. Then we can

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:17.000
 flash on. Just kind of any experience is kind of like any of that that's helpful. We'll flash

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.760
 that on now and do our practice. We'll go right to the beginning of it. And we'll recite the

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.360
 seven line prayer once. So I know I said a lot. So I thought I knew I was going to have to like

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:37.480
 rip through a bunch of stuff. But I appreciate everyone's kind of patience. Hope it was helpful.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:45.160
 And may I synthesize this as a part of its Borich to endeavor for all beings to wake up

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:56.040
 from suffering the cause of suffering please. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:07.480
 Thank you. Quick final statement. If I could on this kind of relationship between what

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:14.520
 is uncompromising what's definitive and then also what we have to be flexible about

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.640
 what's relative what's skillful then definitely in terms of these highest teachings

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:28.520
 Zogchen talking about transcendental wisdom rainbow body we have to come to the uncompromising

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:36.900
 certainty wisdom of the true nature of our mind. We have to that is something we have to get

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.400
 certain

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:47.480
 about and anything that supports that is a path. And so we get personal instruction from a teacher

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:56.840
 any on a support that works as a coherent ecology ecosystem you meditation conduct

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.960
 fruition anything that boosts that realization is a supportive structure and we should be flexible

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:08.120
 with what is skillful to help us do that why so we can be available to help other beings

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:16.040
 skillfully flexibly with what actually helps not with what we want to help but what actually helps

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:22.040
 what serves so it's really it definitely comes down to what we have to really have certainty about

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:27.640
 is a true nature of mind regardless of what's happening to us that's something we have to get

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:35.800
 definitive about and it's clear in all the Tantras guru yoga is the essential method

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:42.840
 to bring about that realization swiftly that's a non-negotiable technique it's

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:50.760
 all the Tantras say that all the Zogchen teachings say that connecting with the heart essence of

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:50.920
 the

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:56.920
 guru is the embodiment of all the buddhas of the three times that is the swift path

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.720
 of Zogchen so that means we are seeing the guru as transcendental wisdom rainbow body

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.280
 we're seeing the mandala that we're a part of as transcendental wisdom rainbow body

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:15.000
 this guru yoga activates that view so we can really more quickly more thoroughly more

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.880
 comprehensively integrate that view to all the aspects of our being so that's kind of where the

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.920
 pinnacle that all these kind of views of kind of provisional and definitive they all get to that

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:34.280
 of the various different eight practice lineages they all come to that point they agree on that

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:41.560
 and then as a secondary comment in terms of wisdom rainbow body this more i just thought

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.240
 i should throw it in because the topic's so big and i don't know when i'd come back to it

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:55.800
 there's oftentimes a lot of kind of philosophical nitpicking over well just exactly is you know

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:02.440
 which what's the subtlest level level fabric layer of reality in the bardo when it's not

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.160
 conditioned

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.720
 and how does the true nature express itself and is it red or blue you know is it two arms or four

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.200
 is it man or is it woman is it multiple or is it singular is it all that stuff there's so many

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.960
 discussions on that and there's a lot of tantras that make a lot of statements about that but i've

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:28.200
 been in the room when people have asked that kind of question in the bardo after we die and duality

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.720
 mind hasn't turned on yet and all these appearances start coming sounds and beams and lights and

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.040
 shapes

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.720
 and colors and all these things that they're talked about in the tantras in so many ways

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.640
 peaceful wrathful deities and fabiana buddhas and all these things

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:49.560
 what does it have to look like what is the definitive way that it will definitely look

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.040
 like regardless of culture epic time gender class language all that stuff regardless of all that

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.560
 and always in the room the teacher laughs

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.920
 because it's at that level it's flexible

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:15.640
 it keeps being flexible there's no ground you look in vadra safa what's in vadra safa's heart

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.200
 another vadra safa with a different color what's in vadra safa's heart yamantaka what's

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:27.640
 in yamantaka's heart it just keeps folding unfolding and if we try to get too tight around

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.520
 trying to have a definitive thing over a certain relative expression then it usually means we're

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.680
 kind of obsessing over a detail that's preventing us from connecting to practice actually

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:44.920
 and at the same time there are very specific patterns of pure relative truth

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:53.480
 you can't just mix and match them the tantras are also super clear on this if you once you

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:59.320
 pick a game in arena a certain way a certain mandala a certain type of pure land the features

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:06.520
 are the features lock in and they're interdependent and they change but it's definitely specific

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:12.840
 features that's not just a mal amorphous just gelling of any pattern anything it's not chaos

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:19.800
 it's very specific pristine patterns if you zoom in on any one pattern it opens up into a whole

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:26.680
 another universe but before you zoom in it's very patterned because it's pure relative truth

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:33.720
 interacting so it's very precise and then it opens into more precision and it zooms out into

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.920
 more precision and so we have to maintain that flexibility when we're trying to really definitively

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.720
 hold a certain point we need to hold it but hold it lightly so that's the final thing

01:14:45.720 --> 01:15:01.160
 thank you all so much it's always a pleasure thank you thank you all
