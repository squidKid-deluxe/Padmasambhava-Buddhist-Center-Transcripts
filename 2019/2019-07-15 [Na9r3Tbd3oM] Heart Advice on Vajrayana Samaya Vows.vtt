00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 The first is Samayas. Samaya, you all know, I don't have to say anything, but Samayam is the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.200
 commitment, with courage, with yoga, keeping up our commitment, and coming up again, if you want to

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.000
 hear what is mentioned, all Samayas can be summarized into all each other.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.810
 So, we need to preserve the bodhijata. The bodhijata can be understood, or not understood, it can

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.000
 be divided as relative to the bodhijata and absolute to the bodhijata, so to bodhijata.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.970
 And the relative to the bodhijata can be divided as wishing bodhijata and actualizing bodhijata,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.000
 also again relative to the bodhijata.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.140
 And the essence of the wishing bodhijata is all boundless, and we all know that, we join that open,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.000
 so all boundless.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.300
 Boundless love, boundless compassion, boundless joy and appreciation, and boundless or reduce, and

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.000
 boundless economy, keep that in heart.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And to preserve that, again, it's not just a wishing bodhijata, but also actualizing bodhijata.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 It's courage and commitment, and patience, and openness.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 So, with that, keep the wishing bodhijata, and then as we have the wishing bodhijata in our heart,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.000
 family, in citizen status, then do the actualizing bodhijata,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 which is then, the actualizing bodhijata can be many things.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Practicing dharma is actualizing bodhijata.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 We practice such, we just started with bodhijata, and we think that whenever we are all living,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 being really doing something with it, and that's our activity.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 And then also known as sixth part of the practice, all those wishing bodhijata, whatever you can do

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.000
, according to your capability, but with your inspirations.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And courage and commitment, that is what is preserving, keeping that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.960
 And what a great master, known as, I think many of you know that very beautiful life story of the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.000
 life story of God as well, of magical dance.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Magical dance of illusion.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 What?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Wondrous dance of illusion.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 What?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Wondrous dance of illusion.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Wondrous?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Wondrous.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Wondrous, that great master's, his teacher is known as nyunku.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And he highlighted, it's not just only him, he highlighted that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 When we take the bodhijata for example, vows, we keep the vows, that's what we call it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 But to upkeep that, up is the hook, the hook of the commitment and hook.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 The hook of commitment.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So when we take sometimes vows and this commitment, but we lose, we lost the commitment.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We don't have enough hook to hold it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.750
 So really this great master said, have the vows or keep the commitment, but keep up the commitment,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.000
 hook of the commitment.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Dhamjic japchung said that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Dhamjic japchung means hook.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 H-O-O-K.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 So we can keep those.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 We can be reminded that to us.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Practice is why we're not going to practice by someone, we're going to practice our style.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 While we're going to practice, we're going to practice our, rewirling our triggers.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.960
 And due to our own habit effectiveness of the samsara, the level piled up through all the light

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.000
 times,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 already there's weakness times, we can lose, we can kind of fall down on the ditch.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 But not just kind of falling on that ditch, immediately trying to bounce back.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 That is practice, bounce back.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Be, stand firmly, reactivate, and feel the presence of the Gurdwama, some of the lineage masters.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Master their blessings, really stand up firmly and be in our principles.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Then practice, to those old practices.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 So the wishing bodhic jata and actualizing bodhic jata, that really, that is all related to the bod

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.000
hic jata.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And after the true bodhic jata is the meditation, zukin meditation, or the Mahamudar meditation.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 The meditation, that means also kind of the power and energy of the meditation is not grasping,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 clinging too much.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.860
 Even though sometimes we know it's not really good health for our and not good for anything, but we

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.000
 hold up with that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 We do that, not just you, we all do this.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 That is then grasping, clinging on the habit dependence, and guided by the force of that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Then we lose the control, our strength, our identities.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.130
 So bring a little bit of the thought of no grasping, and those are then part of the meditation

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.000
 practice, the absolute bodhic jata.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Then talk with your practice of meditation, what do you already have?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Such as, give up those practices, and all those maintain it as much as you can.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 And we gather it in the Buddha teaching, what's the name of the Master who measures all Buddhas.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Generally, in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 One Buddha in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Hayagirma, Madhya Vada, in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 O Vayakalaya, in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Kirei, in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And Guruvama, Samhara, in bodhis, all Buddhas.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So with that thought, and practice, highlight.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Then we're keeping Samayas of the connection to all the Buddhas.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 So those are basically kind of the, just a reminder of the Samayas.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Then you all, you know.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And the Samayas is the only one to tell, is maintain our practices.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 And we like to, for example, when we get the Buddha blend of the flowers, in the Buddha board,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 we sold out on the flower market, and bought and blended that.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 But then it always comes with the chips.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 There's a small level of chips.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And we like to really keep that beautiful blooming as you saw.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Then you have to try and keep that, those chips.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 That is Samayas.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Then it will bloom more.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Even with beautiful eyes, we don't keep that chips.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Then it goes away.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 I mean, it goes slowly, it goes away.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Perfect.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And then you say, oh, what happened?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 This is not going well.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Of course not.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 It's not going well.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Because we're telling Father Jim's.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 That's the Samayas.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 That's really his, that's it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 That's the Samayas.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Samayas is not keeping for the Buddha, not keeping for the Dharma, not keeping for the other Sangha

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 members.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 But it's for our sake.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 I want our sake.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I mean, that's what it is, really.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 That, you know, I'm not just telling the stories, all that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 So that's it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 So that is really, those are brilliant about the Samayas.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And again, in the presence of all the Madalas.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And you will repeat this following phrase.
