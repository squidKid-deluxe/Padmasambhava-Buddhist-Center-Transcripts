Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\nTranslated by Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nBuy Here:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/chiso/books-by-khenpo-rinpoches/invincible-determination-of-the-princess-yeshe-dawa-a-commentary-on-the-twenty-one-verses-of-praise-and-homage-with-the-root-mantra-of-arya-tara\n\n\u201cNoble Lady Ta\u0304ra\u0304 is truly a living buddha right now, guiding and helping all beings, and she will continually be a protector and guide for all who are devoted to her. How did Ta\u0304ra\u0304 become a buddha? The gracious teacher Buddha S\u0301a\u0304kyamuni gave many beautiful teachings about how she developed her realization and appeared as a protector of this world to liberate all beings. According to a common understanding of gradual development on the path, the Buddha mentioned that her journey began as an extraordinary, courageous princess known as Yeshe Dawa, who eventually reached full enlightenment.\n\nThere are many Ta\u0304ra\u0304 sa\u0304dhanas, covering the entire range of her four activities of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and liberating. There are also quite a few commentaries on the Praises to the Twenty- One Ta\u0304ra\u0304s by many great masters. This commentary is written by the very well-known master and Vajraya\u0304na Buddhist monk and scholar Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche precisely according to the lineage instructions. This is a stainless, pure nectar teaching by one who maintains the perfect lineage of the Buddhadharma and Vajraya\u0304na teachings. The Invincible Determination of the Princess Yeshe Dawa: A Commentary on the Twenty-One Verses of Praise and Homage with the Root Mantra of A\u0304rya Ta\u0304ra\u0304, is quite unique in that it is so comprehensive and complete, and includes all the levels of the Inner Tantras of the Vajraya\u0304na. It includes many methods that we can apply to actualize our realization of the nature of mind, including according to: (1) a devotional level of practice, (2) the creation stage visualization practice of Maha\u0304yoga, (3) the completion stage with characteristics of Tsalung and Tummo of Anuyoga, and finally (4) the completion stage without characteristics of Dzogchen Atiyoga. This book explains these four different ways to explore the profound, secret practices of the Praises to the Twenty-One Ta\u0304ra\u0304s for each of the Twenty-One Ta\u0304ra\u0304s, according to however a disciple wishes to practice.\n\nIt has been an honor for us to translate Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\u2019s commentary. I had the opportunity to see Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\u2019s original, handwritten manuscript in Tibetan, and this translation lines up exactly with his supreme wishes to benefit the Buddhadharma and all beings.\u201d\n\n-Ven.

 "We are looking at this book for so many months. It didn't come somehow, it delayed, it delayed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 And it supposedly comes these early weeks, but then it came today, this really book.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 This book is the Kenkyi Pati Sherab Rinpoche's commentary on the Tārā, Praise to the Twenty-One T

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.000
ārās.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.530
 That commentary, we revise it under the title, as maybe you see, "Invisible Determination of the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.000
 Princess Yeshe Dawa."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.020
 That's under the title of the book. And I had also the opportunity to see his ordinal manuscript by

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 the very hand ratings.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.600
 So I really looked at that, and then, also with other texts, and so combined together with the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 assistance of our Sangha member,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 member Pete De Niro and Bea Mataji, and all the other many Sangha members who really helped us.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 It's mentioned in the whole world, or ethnology, so that now we really put out this poem in honor

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and memory to the Kenkyi Pati Sherab Rinpoche,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 as well as all the lineage masters, and then more than that, and then we wish, by the bless of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 great Mother Tārā,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.720
 that we all have really long life, joy, peace, happiness, love, realization for ourselves, and as

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.000
 well as for the world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 There's no more wars, no more sufferings, commandments, drugs, all those things.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 It really is a complete despair, and it brings the beautiful abundance of the Golden Age

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.000
 opportunity to be back to the world, really, really sincerely,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and then also to scroll the Buddha teachings. And just for every good purpose, really, we do this.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 So I'm very excited and happy to show this. This is the front cover, and this is the back side, and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.000
 so they say,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 "Thank you, everyone."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 - Thank you. - Thank you.
