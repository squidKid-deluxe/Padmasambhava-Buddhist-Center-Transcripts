00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The Madhyamaka is now the second Mahayanan school, and the Madhyamaka has three schools.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 There are quite a few different schools, but a big one in the teaching management is two.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 The Swatantra Madhyama school and Prasang Madhyama school in the Tibetan school is called Rangipa.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Rangipa and Prasang Madhya are also two big famous philosophy schools, two schools.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 And what is the view of the Madhyama, these schools? The view is, in the teaching management,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 both see every phenomenon existing as emptiness. Everything is emptiness.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 All phenomena is existing which is really establishing true truth, relative truth and absolute

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 truth.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 All this phenomena is existing, the relative truth. All this in nature is emptiness.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.690
 The relative truth, there is no substantial solid existing entity whatsoever, is all absolute level

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.000
, is the emptiness.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.510
 On the relative level, it appears as magically, magically, through the interdependent ordination

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.000
 systems,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.510
 through the interdependent ordination, many combinations of all the cause and condition, appears as

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.000
 magically appeared.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.480
 Because the way it is appeared is magically. When the beginning time it comes is magically, it is

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.000
 like magically existing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is like magically, it is all, there is no substantial solid existing entity at all.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 It is all like magical displays, relative truth. And the absolute level is totally emptiness.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.050
 This emptiness and the relative emptiness are absolute truth, relative truth of the apparent magic

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.000
 display, both are inseparable union states.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So that is what here, also T.T. Megan, they all see everything as emptiness.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So it is an emptiness entity, like there is no substantial existence, but relative level it is,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 everything is functioning as it is.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And that is really about the view of the Madhima schools. Madhima schools.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.790
 And then in the teaching of these two famous schools, the Swatantar Madhima school and the Prasang

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.000
ya Madhima schools,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 it is slightly different to establishing that and to emphasize of the emptiness of true nature as

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.000
 it is.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And the Swatantar Madhima schools coordinate teaching and many great masters often said,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.080
 they said, emptiness is on an absolute level is emptiness, on a relative level everything as

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 existing as it is.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.860
 So they have slightly two kinds of different steps. The absolute level is emptiness, relative level

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.000
, everything as it is, all magically, magically existing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.850
 So not immediately say everything is an emptiness status. All emptiness is a poem, poem is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.000
 emptiness, not immediately as a theology.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.820
 So making two steps, in a way, one steps. Both these days, the absolute level, there is no, nothing

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.000
 is existing.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.750
 As the great Shri Kya Buddha taught in the Heart Satra, for example, every tongue, no eye, no palm,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.000
 no nose, no tongue.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.030
 All that is an absolute level, not negated on the relative. That's what the Swatantar Madhima

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.000
 schools say.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 It's not negating that. And that is also more practical for the common, ever-ready person.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Immediately, for example, we meditate, there is no egoless, no egos, no egolessness.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.120
 So that means, on a relative level, we have the ego, or we have the eye. But it's not something

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.000
 existing, it's holiday existing, it's an ocean.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.510
 We have ego. But the absolute level, no ego. So that is how, kind of step by step, these were Swat

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.000
antar Madhima schools, kind of mainly in the TKC.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.330
 Who are the masters of Swatantar Madhima schools? The famous one that we know. For example, our

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.000
 great master, Chanda Rakhetar, Kamal Khila.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And Chanda Rakhetar's teacher, known as Jana Garba, those are known as Swatantar Madhima schools.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 And then Nagar Jana is the father of all the Madhima schools. It's not divided with Swatantar Madh

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.000
ima, nor Prasang Madhima is the founder of the Madhima schools.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.510
 Within the Madhima school, then we can come later. Afterward, Nagar Jana, Swatantar Madhima school,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.000
 and Prasang Madhima school, those are teaching missions.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.340
 So it's brilliant. I'm talking really about how that happened. But both are, that is the view of

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.000
 the, both in the absolute level, is the great master.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.620
 Chanda Rakhetar also said in his very famous philosophy text, Madhima Alankara, in absolute level,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.000
 there is even negation is not existing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.840
 Negation is not existing, and that means what? We may say that no "I". No "I" means also conception

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.000
.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 That is also not really existing, because absolutely goes beyond existing and non-existing beyond.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:38.740
 But he said, since there is no, I mean, also in his teaching, Chanda Rakhetar said, in his teaching

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.000
, in the absolute level, there is no birth, no death.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 That's an origin of it. No birth, no death, or no birth, no seizing. No seizing. Seizing.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.510
 So in the Chanda Rakhetar, there is no birth, in the absolute level, there is no birth, even, and,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.000
 yeah, I'm sorry, even there is no negation existing.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Negation is not existing. That means negation, holding negation is grasping, clinging.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 That is the entrance of the enlightenment or realisation. So that is.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.480
 And Prasang Madhyaman schools, the great masters, such as Chanda Kirti's and Shanti Deva's, those

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.000
 are in teaching in the M.D.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.170
 and so many others in the Tibetan, mostly following Prasang Madhyaman schools, but however, also

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.000
 the Prasang Madhyaman schools, too.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.690
 So those are really about the explanation of the according again, Zoki Point 11, and holding on the

00:07:52.690 --> 00:08:00.000
 will of the emptiness is, again, the detour of the enlightenment or realisation.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.210
 And with that, and then, of course, that's the will, and the meditation is a completely meditating

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.000
 truth.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.510
 Meditation has meditating of the true egolessness, egolessness of the phenomena, egolessness of the

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:22.000
 individual egolessness, and meditating on that state.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.350
 That is the meditation, combined with the perfect, beautiful conduct. Those conduct are known as

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:36.000
 Mahayana, the Bodhisattva conduct, the conduct that will avoid all the negative activities,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.470
 and conduct of morality that will avoid all the negative ideas, and morality that gather in all the

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:50.750
 virtuous activities, and morality that will help into all the beings, according to their readiness

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.000
 or according to your capabilities.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Those are known as the three morality practices, and keeping up the three morality practices,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.440
 really accumulating true marriage with the six of our mothers, and meditating on the true egoless

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.000
ness status,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:20.100
 and achieving this pokaya or tikaya step, or advancing five boomies and ten boomies, and achieving

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.000
 the Bodhisattva achieving enlightenment with the whole world.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.830
 So, that is really about the Mademaka's truth, Mademaka's truth. So, again, as I said, according to

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:41.090
 the looking point of view, when you look at the looking point of view, still they're holding a kind

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.000
 of morality emphasize too much on emptiness.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.920
 That's what they're seeking here to say, too. So, Mademaka apparently thinks all things are as

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.000
 emptiness, that emptiness, that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 And then the next one is the Kriyat, and the practice of the Kriyat.
