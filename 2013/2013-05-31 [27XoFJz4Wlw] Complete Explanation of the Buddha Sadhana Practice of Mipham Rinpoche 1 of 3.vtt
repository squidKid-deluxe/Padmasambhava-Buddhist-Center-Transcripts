00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
 This you will every have the text you look at this teaching. So now, for example, this practice,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.600
 again, every of those great masters always lay out so beautifully, so calm, easy and so practical

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.360
 to the every practitioners, and there are practices that are going to be divided into three groups.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.320
 The first part is a foundation, middle part is the principal part of the practices,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.160
 and the concluding of the practices. Those are the three. First, generally, what the practice is,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 is we all know what practice means, we're practicing of our goodness. Goodness, as I discussed

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 in a title I make in the youth, is our love, kindness, compassion. Relax our mind, relax,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 calm and peaceful state. That is what we're going to practice. With this practice, we like to

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.600
 become

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.240
 that, not just a practice as true to make that, but ourselves we like to become. Peace,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:13.040
 ourselves we like to become. Joy, peaceful, happy, and then appreciate it. As Buddha is, of course,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 we taught the teacher, but Buddha become that. Buddha is true love, Buddha is true compassion,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.600
 Buddha is true courage, commitment, the appreciation, respect. That is what the Buddha is. That is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.920
 our

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 practice that we like to become. And we do that practice, what it's doing, is removing those all

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.230
 unwanted things that we don't like. The suffering, sadness, difficulties, troubles, emotions

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.720
 swinging

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.320
 up in the dome, those, those all removing, those all glaring, glaring, and then what comes out,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.080
 as I said, joy, happy, appreciation, magic, the display of this universe. In ourselves,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.400
 magic, the whole beauty of the magic comes so brilliant, so perfectly, and yet it's so,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.440
 everything comes so, has meanings. That really brings up that philosophy, the practice. So,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.120
 that is what practices. So, we should do these practices. According to Vedic Buddhism,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.240
 there's two practices, two ways to explore these qualities. This is called, then, the practicing,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.680
 such as chanting the mantra, chanting the sardana. This is practice, this is the meditation,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.080
 chanting the mantra, chanting the sardana is the meditation, meditation. And then, also silence,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.800
 what we call meditation, that is a meditation. Both are meditation,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.160
 chanting is not just not meditating, chanting is a meditation. We, what means meditation? Generally

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.160
,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.920
 meditation means concentrating, abiding our mind in one simple status. We know that, disturbed

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.120
 by the distractions of the external force, the external force of the suggestion, object of five

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:19.040
 senses, the poem, song, smell, touch, taste, touch, and imagination, not disturbed. Our mind

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.920
 settles,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.840
 exactly where you landed, where you are, leading mind, resting mind in that state, moving forward,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.320
 is a great exploring of the beauty of the inner mind qualities. So, therefore, this,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.360
 there's true, according to Vedic Buddhism, Vedic and the Buddhism, has two practices,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.280
 two meditating, two meditating, chanting, reciting mantra, is meditation, and silence as everybody,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.400
 that is meditation. This, generally, silence and look, and the journey of meditation, both are not

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.920
 separated from each other. Both are the same. Same is nothing really big difference. Both are

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.200
 because performed, drawn by the mind. It's nothing else drawn by that. Our mind, and we mind is

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.600
 rested as we are designated, as we lead, and we stay. What it brings, it brings joy, and an

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.040
 appreciation, and calm, and peaceful, and devotion, and that all comes up. Then, this is a great

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.320
 meditation practice. So, with that understanding, now, we begin, for example, with this first

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.960
 practice. First, this part of this practice is rafu and bodhisattva. And then, this is the one,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.120
 first practices. Rafu, the brilliant meaning of rafu, is good, strong, presentable kyatamuni,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.200
 right in front of our sky, and is surrounded by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, ahatas,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.800
 and great bodhisattvas, and great bodhisattvas, and six in ahatas, and as well as all the buddhas,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.720
 bodhisattvas, they are right in front of our sky. It feels strongly that presents that thought.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.280
 During the practice, one of the most kind of obstacles to not achieving, not going well,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.200
 our practice is, is known as destructions. There are two destructions. Destructions, for example,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.240
 with your practices, those are the drawbhi destructions, and as a well-scattered destructions,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.360
 two destructions. The drawbhi means sleeping. You know the practices? We start practicing,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.920
 immediately, kind of dullness came, and we feel sleepy, and lonely, and our mind does not become

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.880
 so clear. That is the post-destructions. So if that happens, we have to restate, reactivate our

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.520
 mind,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.740
 more clear, bring up the teachings, bring up the joy, bring up the devotion, bring up the bodhisatt

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.920
va.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.880
 That clarity, that beauty, that strength, kind of clear with darkness, and then bring our

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 meditation, concentration, practice, become more clear, clear, brilliant status. And the second

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.320
 destructions is a scattered mind. Scattered mind, there is many differences. There is something

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.640
 sometimes, scattered mind, is so kind of like so small, so subtle, like low, under low currency,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.400
 currency destructions. Even sometimes we don't notice it. It is happening. That is very subtle

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.680
 destructions, subtle. And the gross destructions, then, such as dark, hesitations, skeptical.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.000
 During

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.560
 the practice, we bring all intellectual ideas, and that, then, how to also disturb it, disturb the

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.360
 practice. Practice means we are settled. We settle with the confident, joy, and appreciation.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.760
 During

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480
 that one-hour practices, hour practices, we are not going to think of all the different

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.040
 intellectual

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:10.480
 ideas taught during the practices. That means we are spoiling our own practice by ourselves,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.640
 with all those different, different tools. Then that is the strength. That will become our practice

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.640
,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:25.120
 become very, kind of like, non-perfect. Like, it becomes kind of deluded practices. So for that

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.720
 reason, during the practices, meditating or practicing, we're trying to really withstand

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.600
 our mind with joy, starting with joy in the appreciation, and devotion, and both each other,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.440
 and we settle to practice whatever, whether you're chanting, trying to follow the meaning of the

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.400
 teaching to what you're chanting. For example, meaning, it has meaning. That word is a reminding

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.840
 of our meditator. We stand on that. We follow our mind with the meaning of the word we're chanting.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.040
 That is meditation. That is practice. That is concentration. Concentration. That is very

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:13.680
 so beautiful. And by doing that with joy, with appreciation, then it's so special practices.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.680
 Practices. We need to come to such as we pass on our Shama, the meditator, as deep,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.400
 without silence, without wobbling, silence, meditation. Still mind with that. Relax in that

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.960
 state. We don't have been disturbed by any of those, those doubt in us, as well as

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.200
 skeletal. We're able to do that for pre-second or one minute. Our mind practice becomes so

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:47.120
 perfect, so beautiful. That is the one really practice. So with this understanding, feel strong

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.560
 presence of the Buddha Shatriment right in front of the sky. When you feel Buddha, it's something

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.100
 that practice is meditator. Really, in the teaching at the beginning of this class, sit in Samadir

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.240
aj

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.920
 circle, sit. Whoever thinks of the Buddha as a golden, golden light, light with beautiful,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:14.560
 beautiful calm and soothing and soothing, call it peaceful. Whoever thinks that, that is great

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:21.600
 meditator. As Buddha said in teaching, it's true. We think that calm, that peaceful, that soothing,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.440
 that blessed, and light. We relax and mangle our mind with that, and not disturb by any other

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.240
 emotional and intellectual ideas. That is relaxing. We're giving mind as good vocations, and so

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.120
 beautiful, so relaxed. You're touching to our own nature, natural rituals. And then sorrow with all

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.840
 the Buddhas and bodhisattvas and our hearts, even though they appear in different forms and

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.240
 different

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.600
 gestures. Meaning is the same. The embodiment of love, kindness, compassion, wisdom, the everywhere

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.960
 right in the blood of us. They're totally enlightened. Once upon a time, they're similar beings,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:06.960
 as many of us, heavily lauded by the emotions. But through their courage and commitment,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:15.200
 both each other and devotion, they become as these great, great beings. They are our role models.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.960
 They are our examples. And we follow the continuity as they did. We will become one of them.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.760
 And therefore, with this thought, full of duels, full of confidence, relax, and then

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:37.200
 stay the rafuddhi. And the rafuddhi pray is this poor prayer. This is poor mind of rafuddhi pray,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.280
 and both the head of prayer is so primitive with the Vedas and Buddhas. This is not just only

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.440
 the one school of Tibetan Buddhism, chanting. These every Buddhist schools of the Tibetan

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:57.720
 are chanting. Many of the great masters say this was composed by the great Dharma king Trasung Ditt

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:57.840
i,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:05.600
 who was the emanation of the Manjushini. He composed. Many of the masters say this was composed

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.200
 by the great master Adi Shah. He is again one of the great masters who was Tibetan. Either way,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.600
 this pray is so famous for all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, everybody gathers. This is

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.920
 blissful. So many great masters, so many great practitioners, giant throughout the centuries.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.560
 Every person of Ditti composed the first time, it started seven centuries, sorry, eight centuries.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.840
 Every Adi here composed it started from the 11th century, 11th century, then continually

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.360
 joined by so many, millions and millions of practitioners. It's really so powerful,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:50.080
 blessed prayers. These first two lines are rafuddhi prayers. And the second two are

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:57.840
 bodhijana prayers. Rafuddhi, the essence of rafuddhi is confidence. Confident, trusty, devotion,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.320
 devotion in the Buddha, Dhanu Sangha, and at the same time understand the meaning of the

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:12.720
 College of our lives, the lives of other beings. The samsara is as it is. Again, we have such

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.280
 beautiful lives, but yet it's not permanent. This is changing, changing, this is changing

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.680
 everything.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.440
 It's not just our lives are changing, lives, everyone's changing. Everything is changing.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:33.200
 There's nothing is lost forever, ever. Bring that clear understanding. This is magical. This is the

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:40.240
 dream. This is the beautiful. Well, I am the beautiful dream status. Beautiful magic status.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.640
 I'm going to make even more beautiful dream, more beautiful magic. Magic that will reflect to me,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.160
 to others with courage and confidence, commitment with the blessings of Buddha, Dhanu Sangha,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:13:00.560
 have blessed. I will follow your examples without disadvantage, courage, and close connection to

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.080
 the Buddha, Dhanu Sangha is known as breathing, taking rafuddhi. Rafuddhi means nandale, our

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.160
 Sangha. Nandale, our Sangha, will be Buddha, Dhanu Sangha, will be full of confidence. Until now,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.240
 we've been wandering everywhere. We've been roaming everywhere, wandering, but today we begin

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:27.920
 shelter to our own home, sweet home. Our home, sweet home, is the shelter. This is the rafuddhi

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.560
 places that we are going to explore as Buddha did, as this great master did. And that should

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.360
 comfort that confidence, correct, and then say this word. How long I'm going to do this? Not just

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:48.560
 this short video, as well I'm doing this phrase, I'm going to take this close, close to my heart,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:55.360
 like this, this until, as in the teachings, until I become the enlightenment, until I become the

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.440
 Buddha. I will take that. I'm doing this not just for myself, but for all the sensitive beings,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:09.280
 for every living beings. I'm going to make that feel that strongly sincerity in heart and mind

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:19.840
 is so special, it's so calming, so soothing, so, so egolessous. This is the egolessous step that we

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:26.560
 imagine. We proclaim that in a way, to our own quality, confidence, without any fear, without

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:35.680
 any hesitation, without interference of the egos and greens, southern borders. We proclaim it.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:43.200
 That's what rabhu means. The second is rabhu is the first footstep to our journey to the joy,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.760
 joy to the enlightenment, joy that will free the suffering, sadness of ours, and all living beings.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.240
 So that is what rabhu means. And the second is, second, third line and fourth line is then

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:03.520
 bodhijata. And bodhijata, of course, all of you know, bodhijata means mind of enlightenment,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:12.560
 mind of enlightenment. It looks very, sounds very fancy, sounds very special. True is very special.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:21.360
 But what means that? What is that? Close enough. That is true love, true compassion, true wisdom.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.040
 That is the word, the mind of enlightenment. This is not something that Buddha owned by,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.550
 Buddha owned, owned by Buddha, or this owned by some girl famous, someone owned, or dollar owned,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.360
 or something.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:42.320
 This is our nature, your nature, my nature. We all have this nature. Today we glorify that nature,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.720
 reproduce that nature. We bring out that nature in the midst of the abhiji patterns, patterns,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.600
 not hundred, covered with abhiji patterns. We bring up that concept. We bring up the true love.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.200
 We bring out the true compassion. We bring out the true understanding to benefit for all the

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:08.480
 sentient beings. Love and compassion and wisdom are the ultimate remedy to remove the suffering,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.400
 the difficult troubles of every single living being and including ourselves. There's nothing else

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.320
 beside that. If we think carefully, whether we are gay, whether we are believer or non-believer,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.920
 whether we are following any religions, this is universal practice. That's what his only Dalai Lama

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.160
 said many times. Love and compassion is a universal practice, not just the preciousness of the

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.560
 human

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.840
 beings, but breaking of everyone. That's what the great master Buddha said. Everyone inherited the

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.610
 Buddha nature. Everyone. Buddha started with love, enlightenment, realizing he started with true

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.280
 love,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:56.320
 true compassion and true wisdom that everyone has. Human beings, non-human beings, everyone

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:04.640
 who, whether we see, whether we don't see, every day is beings. That is their nature. That is our

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:12.560
 nature. We are touching all of our own true beings. This Buddha teaching name many times

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.640
 as Buddha nature, our enlightenment, primordial wisdom, primordial qualities. This is something

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.410
 inherent to qualities. Until now, until the teaching of the Buddha chapter, we go outward with

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:25.760
 habit

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:33.520
 patterns, with all those egos, all these emotions, it's covered up, covered up, covered, it's just

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:40.320
 completely confined underneath that garbage canes. Today, we bring out that beautiful shining

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.200
 diamond,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:48.080
 the jewel, precious, more precious than the diamond, more precious than which profiling jewels

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.760
 in the Buddha teaching set. This is the one we're doing. And we're doing this for all the beings.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:01.840
 That's what happens. So open statement, so incorrect, enlightened statement, as in the teaching set

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.560
,

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.480
 as in the teaching set. By the merit of the generalist and others by me, may I attend

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.840
 the Buddha who for sake of certain beings, for every living means, may I become the Buddha.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:22.400
 That must be already met in the statement. So, so spare. How are we going to explore this,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.880
 this beautiful preciousness of the book, love and kindness completion? That is the truth, here is

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.280
 it,

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:38.720
 by merit of generalist and others by me. These are the tools to discover this, our preciousness

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:46.400
 qualities, qualities, precious nature of this body, the enlightened mind. We're going to discover

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:54.480
 by the tools of the merits, those merits are now the generalist merit, merit of generalist, merit

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:04.330
 of the moralist, merits of the passions, merits of the joyful efforts, merits of the concentrations

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.400
,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.920
 and merits of the worship. Those are the tools we're going to reveal this beautiful nature.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:18.160
 Those are known as in the Buddha teaching, as many of you know, the six paramatas that are when

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:27.120
 paramata means one who leads beyond the, beyond the dualities, to lead the duality. Duality is the

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:34.560
 world of habit patterns, world of the immune, negative emotions, but paramata sounds the way

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:41.600
 one who take the other side, the shows, show of that, the non-dualic status. That is the one

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.920
 that you will need, is six paramatas. So here, of course, this is abbreviated, but here, by others,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:56.000
 but others mean, the other five paramatas that we, again, I listed already, those are the moral,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:05.920
 morality, and patience, and their joyful effort, concentrations, and as well as blessings.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:12.160
 So by that, and then, reaching like this. So that's the bodhicata. Again, this bodhicata is

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.160
 so special. It's one of the extra order teaching of the Buddha Chaturmani that will proclaim,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.480
 in the teaching always, bodhicata is the line's role of the Buddha Chaturmani. It's like line's

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:33.280
 role. It's a fearless statement. This has no body against the bodhicata. Nobody can distribute

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:41.520
 to this bodhicata in the logical, in the reasonable ways. Can't ignore this. Nobody can ignore the

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:47.200
 true love. Nobody can ignore the true compassion. Nobody can ignore the true understanding of the

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.800
 meaning of the value of love and conditions. Nobody can ask. Therefore, this extra only

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.960
 line's role by our greatest teacher, Buddha Chaturmani, who practices this, this, all the

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:08.080
 which is enlightened. When he becomes enlightened, he becomes this bodhicata, straight. So that,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:14.000
 that is the bodhicata. And this is our nature, and this is the nature of everyone. So that is the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.240
 bodhicata, bodhicata. And the next one is then, whole, boldness. Whole, boldness is again,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.680
 again is part of the body, is bodhicata. Reactivating bodhicata. Again,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.040
 de-glorify the bodhicata. And bodhicata generally, I think many of you, maybe you do,

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.840
 there's two bodhicata. Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata. Bodhicata is the mind

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:47.440
 of enlightenment, love and completion of what's the mind that keeps strongly in the mind, wishing

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:56.160
 that to everyone be good, good and happy and peace and joy. Wishing that sincerely from that,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:03.200
 in our heart, that is known as wishing bodhicata. It's just our wish is built for motivation, is

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.920
 wish. With that, with motivation, we need to begin to reflect that in the actions. That is known as

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:17.700
 actualizing, actualizing the wishing bodhicata by action. Action, so wishing bodhicata. So actual

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:17.920
izing

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:25.440
 bodhicata and wishing bodhicata. This whole bond is thought is the, the true or the essence of the

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:33.120
 wishing bodhicata. This is, as great Master Rungjiva said, the wishing bodhicata practices by four

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:40.080
 bondless. And how are we going to do four bondless practices? As in the teaching, he says, first is

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.080
,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:50.960
 bondless love. First is bondless love. Second, it is bondless compassion. And third is bondless joy

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:50.960
.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:23:00.560
 And fourth is bondless of equanimities. Those are known as four bondless practices. Joy, love,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:11.120
 compassion, joy and equanimity. Why is it called bondless? This great Master's teaching says there

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:27.280
 is, is three, when it means bondless. And nature is bondless. And image is bondless,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:36.000
 result, imagination is bondless, and result is bondless. That is three means bondless.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:45.520
 Nature is bondless means when we start thinking, thinking, we don't want any hesitation,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:54.640
 without any doubt. We, great love, great love to all the livingness, where we develop in our heart

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:03.520
 has no restrictions, no restrictions of the, love, love has no boundaries. And therefore,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.840
 nature is bondless. Nature of the way mind is developed, we're not distracted by the egos,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:17.280
 we're not distracted by the traditions, our true love is open to everyone. The way we develop it

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:26.880
 is totally free, open as an open sky, open sky. Therefore, it is known as bondless, limitless.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.920
 The image, as I said, is bondless. Where are we going to project that true love to all the beings,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:45.120
 all the beings? The beings are, in the Buddha teaching said, is limitless. As far as sky goes,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:55.120
 that far there is living beings. As far as space goes, that far there is beings. As far as the

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:03.200
 beings there, that, that much, there's karma and negative emotions. As much as there's karma and

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:11.120
 negative emotions, therefore, that many also difficulty, challenge and sufferings. So therefore,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:19.200
 our love, where we started, is not just limited, but all the living beings. We love all the living

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:27.200
 beings, everyone. Open that heart and open that mind, that attitude from your heart and project

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.440
 that your old living being is known as then. The image, the object, sorry, maybe I should,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.760
 shouldn't use image, object is bondless. The natural is bondless, object is bondless,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.120
 object is bondless. Because of that bondless, the result is bondless,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:55.360
 benefit is bondless, benefit to yourself is bond, bondless, benefit or what, benefit,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:04.000
 benefit to the dual is bondless, benefited to the, to the business is bondless. We cannot count the

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.670
 result both ways. It's immediately benefited to ourself. While we did this, purify all negativities

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:11.760
,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:20.480
 obscurities, obstacles, and all those bad edits, the heavy edits, the stressful edits,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.640
 the dragging down us all the time, down and down, that made with that burden. It lighten up our

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.280
 self

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.960
 and our heart and mind. Truly, it is so special. That sincerely wishing that thought and making

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.690
 these statements, these prayers in the presence of the Buddha, dharmasanas, right in front of the

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:40.880
 sky,

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.920
 that is the most powerful practices, one of the most powerful practices. We really expressed that

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:53.680
 we sincerely, sincerely, in the presence of the Buddha, dharmasana, and we think that

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:00.150
 sincerity to all beings is truly so special. That's what great master, K.T. Paddishya, you always

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:00.800
 say,

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.080
 even just to do this bondless practice of love, love itself is self-great practices.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.680
 And then compare it, joy, and this economic. Each is so special, so powerful practices.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.600
 And there's so many beautiful stories. Even thinking of the one good heart, good heart,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:25.360
 feeling thought, big bond, big result. So many stories, beautiful stories. I mean, you can read

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.160
 those things later and maybe we have some times you can discuss those. We read so many beautiful

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:37.760
 stories. Even one single thought, single good thought, changing the whole vision of that

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:46.160
 individual's goal and future. So powerful, so special, so beneficial. So this is known as

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:54.080
 wishing body. Wishing body, the big essence. We wish that sincerity to everyone and pray these

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.400
 three times in the wind, our day begins in the morning, when we wake up this, treat these

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.350
 techniques with three ruffled, ruffled in bodhicata and do this prayer. That we're setting

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.840
 beautiful

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:13.840
 set for all day, hours out. Something so beautiful. Nobody can distribute this. Nobody can say this

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.920
 is not right. It's truly beautiful. In the Buddha teachings, even the gods and the buddhas cannot

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:28.560
 object that. This is so special. Gods, Brahma, Indra, Shiva, Viphanos. Gods, anybody cannot say

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:36.720
 this is not right. Right. It's truly, we're making something beautiful. And then we're touching our

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.600
 goal of true nature, our own being, our nature, basic nature. Without the interference of the ego

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:50.160
 clean, without the interference of the greed, self-evocate. Something so divine, so unique,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.560
 so authentic, that is what it is. So that is the one that is the first part of these practices.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.360
 First, ponderative practice. With these ponderative practices, once we know these practices,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:10.080
 and then we do this. As in the teaching setting, first, in here, teaching set by Garetha Master

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:18.240
 Mooji. All phenomenal efforts, they are, do not truly exist. Keep this meaning in mind while

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:27.780
 reciting these polar practices. So, everything is magic. Truly, it is magic. Where it came is magic

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.080
.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:35.120
 Where it is here is magic. Where it's ending is magic. Magic. That's the universal. Of course,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.680
 we can say immediately that, but there's many Buddha teachings. Logging and all those things.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.440
 This universe is not here. No one's up on the time. It's our world where we are. It's also kind,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:52.640
 came as many of us came. And now it's existing. And also it's changing roughly every time.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:30:00.080
 Time. It's translucent. And then also it will end. And the way we came here, we're not here

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:09.200
 50 years ago, 60 years ago, not here. And now we're here. And after 50, 60 years ago,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:17.680
 after, I don't know if we were here again. Same thing. It's just magic. We came as magic. We

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:25.040
 hid as magic. We were concluded as magic. And magic continues, a quarter of Buddha teaching.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:32.880
 The spiral continues. This is true. It is what it is. Not just we are taking, talking to the others

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:32.880
,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.200
 their values, ourselves. Everyone is there. We're looking to the magic. We look walking to the

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.000
 magic.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.440
 We listen to the magic. We're feeling the magic. Everything is as much as the status.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:51.520
 Prayer of prayer. Within the magic, there is a magic of the beauties, beauty of love,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.960
 compassion. There are magic too. Love in hand is complete. Buddhas are magic. In light brings

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:04.160
 magic. With this realization, we do that. In the Buddha's teaching, we're touching close with

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.640
 nature's arm. Nature's arm, we don't interfere with the struggle of dualities. We don't understand

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:17.040
 it. Then he said in teaching, and we recognize the Buddha's sacrament. And still, right in front of

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.520
 sky. Sky, we can remain ourselves as what we are. For Buddha, we build right in front of sky.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.080
 Sky, and then all the teaching said here, says, so I don't have to, you all know, the Buddha is

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:36.960
 total embodiment of true love and competitive wisdom. That is what the Buddha, not just that

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:44.000
 Buddha, but Buddha, he embodies all the Buddhas in light brings in one single stage. As Buddha

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.680
 Shaktaman, so calm, so peaceful, so soothing. Buddha is truly calm, truly simple. Look to

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.410
 read his statement. From the first day, first, his teaching, all which are under it, enter

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.160
 enlightenment.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.600
 His teaching is on the true love, true compassion, true wisdom, and respect and

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 appreciation to everyone's. There's nothing higher, Lord, and everyone's equal. Everyone's the same

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:10.720
.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:17.200
 Everyone's the same nature. Everyone, when they walk for their nature, everyone will get

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.160
 same realization, same God as the Buddha did this. Those statements are very uplifting and usher us

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.160
.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:30.480
 It's truly so true. This is true. It's not just Buddha making us to believe that that's not,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:37.920
 it is true. We all have that God, that is, and to visualize that truly as embodiment of all

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:44.720
 enlightenment. And once another state is came, as Buddha, and the living Buddha, not just Amen,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.960
 truly feel that, truly see that right in front of us. And this Buddha is a sovereign body,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.480
 then it goes like this. All different Buddhas, some of them are tired, some of the Buddhas,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:04.480
 but the Vedas are, you know, all at Bodhisattva, 16, all of us. And this, oh, this is great.
