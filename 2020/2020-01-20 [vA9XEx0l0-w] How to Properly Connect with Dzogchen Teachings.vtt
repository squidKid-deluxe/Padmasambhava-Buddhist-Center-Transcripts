00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
 Master Karma Chami is teaching on the union of Dzogchen and Mahamudra, but this is a condensed

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.680
 teaching, so I have to explain it. So this is a condensed teaching. For that reason, he

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.040
 even, yeah, he said that's a condensed. So those people who want to do the practice of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.720
 the union of the Mahamudra and Dzogchen, I will explain the very condensed level. That's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.760
 what the great master Raga Aceh says. So the Amuda, now when you follow the path of the Dzogchen

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.520
 or these practices of Mahamudra, according to the teaching, first you contract with the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 qualified teachers. And the qualified teachers. And also contract with the qualified teachers

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:55.360
 with the proper manner and the proper systems. What is that? That is joy and appreciations

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.800
 and then devotions. You contract that. From the deep of heart, I like to explore and I like to

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.600
 do the practice, meditate, explode, realization, or get enlightenment or some degree of all those

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 visual thoughts, attitudes, people. Then you see the teachings. Teachings and then, but when you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.800
 see the teaching and the instructions, what are those? In the teaching, always you see the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.280
 teachings

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.520
 and the instructions, particularly in Vedic teaching, you see also the empowerment, transmission,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.680
 and a bit of instructions. When you see the teachings and also then practice, follow with

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 the foundation practices, such as the Mundo practices. Those are the foundation practices.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.840
 And all these practices, how we are going to practice, and that is going to practice by the,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.720
 as I mentioned earlier, I mentioned two days ago, and we all know that. We need devotion,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.800
 joy for effort, and anyway, clear mind. We are going to practice, practice. And to get with that,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.760
 then poor renunciation of thoughts, or poor those thoughts. Poor renunciation is again, what are

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.560
 those? Those are the, of course, you all know that it is thinking of the precious within lives,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 and it's like thinking of the impermanence, and thinking of the cause and ethics that are

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.320
 inevitable, and thinking of the samsara has a lot of challenge in the difficulties.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.320
 So, rough relaxing those thoughts, clearly and beautifully, really joy and appreciation,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.960
 with that thought. And then there is a practice, practice, and particularly this song is meditation

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.960
.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.840
 Oh, meditation. There are two practices, generally those are practices of the visualization,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.720
 practices, really, just simply, meditation, resting in the calm and peaceful states.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.320
 So, either one are so special, powerful, but this time, mainly explaining highlight of the,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.960
 of the, of the meditation, silence meditation. And now to do this, this is what? Here, say that,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.560
 all of the, among the, among the, among the method of the realization, it appears in our own

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.400
 mind, among the method of the realization of appearing in our own mind, there is no

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.610
 techniques more profound than the guru yours. And so that's about the great master, Kedokarma Chami

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.800
,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.440
 is highlight of the devotion is so important. What that devotion I asked, we went through,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.880
 and you all know that, that in the devotion is a combination of the joy, and appreciation,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.600
 and confidence. Confidence, that is this three beautiful attitudes are combined together,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.640
 that is known as devotion. In the debate world, there is a general tool,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:24.230
 Tepa and Mugu. Tepa means, I think, it's exactly same as in, in, in English, English pad, F-A-I-T-F

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240
,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 pad. And then, then Mugu is devotion. So, what is the difference between pad and devotion in

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.480
 English? Maybe it's very similar, but in the debate, devotion means, I mean, this Mugu means,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.040
 it's joy, appreciation, and confidence. Feel the precious, really precious. Feel up in joy,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.840
 and like to do, like to explore, like to settle, settle that. No, not lingering of the doubt and

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.880
 hesitations, this and that. Now you settle, now settle. Life is a devotion. When you have that

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.360
 devotion, then, after we continue to keep that, strongly keep that, then it really boom. It will

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.150
 arise in that. That's what we're looking for, of the realization. For that reason, I mean, the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.800
 devotion

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.600
 is so important. Every teaching says, and the Buddha Shakyamuni also, he has so many teaching

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.880
 images. Even he himself has a great deal, even though he's 10 women born in Sato before to get

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.440
 enlightenment. According to the general teaching, teaching is because he was born as a princess,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.320
 and a princess, but he left the kingdom, and to explore, and to search of the enlightenment,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.160
 or search of the meaning of life. But in the teaching said, his determination, joy, and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.800
 appreciation, and perseverance to explore that is unshakable. That tells how strong that is,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.360
 and how his devotees. And then he will set under the Bodhi tree, what he made a commitment to get

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.280
 in life, before we get enlightenment. Under the Bodhi tree, we lay out perfectly beautiful

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.680
 kuja grass, and teaching says, and under the Bodhi tree, facing to the east direction, and he said,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.040
 no matter whatever happened in this setting, without the opportunity, the enlightenment

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.410
 are never, never going to move from this cushion, or this sitting, sitting. Whether my book, the

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.880
 bone

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.320
 is, or my skin is completely dried up, bones are coming apart, but earth is cracking and going to

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.000
 tell bone. But I'm never going to move from this, this, without obtaining the enlightenment, or the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.760
 discoverer of the enlightenment. That shows that courage, and commitment, and confidence.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:09.600
 Then all the Mara's came, and all those that we, we, you know that, that. And then in all the

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.760
 great mass, Gurdhva Maasambhava is known as the totally emanation of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:23.520
 reincarnation of the Buddha Shakyamuni. But even him, in that externally to show to us, really he

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.240
 pursued very assertive practices, many places, received the teaching, and when all the different

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:37.200
 places practiced, meditated, exalted, and then he announced, or he claimed that I received it,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.400
 I've become the enlightenment, or I received the immortality, and so forth. But he is already

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:49.520
 seated. But even though that he showed to us, he showed how important. Then you read all the books,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.960
 there are those great masters, we call the great masters, look after their life stories, one after

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:02.800
 another. Another, they contracted so perfectly, practiced in the meditated, and followed their

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.720
 struggles, and struggles with the courage and commitment with the devotees. Other day we are

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.160
 talking about the one, the person asked, did Telova's, and about the Nara's. And they looked at

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.360
 their

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:24.160
 life stories. How Telova is, how strong he is, how powerful he is, in a way, and the Nara's part,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.800
 how much he's committed, how strong his joy, and the appreciation, the confidence, the courage,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.520
 never lingered, never lingered, even though he wears so many hardships, difficult. In the teaching

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.960
 he said, that purified all the obscurators, being as asad practices, and purified, and then he got

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:55.280
 realization. I mean, all that one after another, it's so, all these great masters. So that's how

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:04.880
 she assures them, that the devotions, and the coordination, confidence, that not lingering,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.560
 that that is so important, important, and necessary in order to develop the realization.
