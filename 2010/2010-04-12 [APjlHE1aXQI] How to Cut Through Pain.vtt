00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 The physical pain that is, I think, depends with the realisation of the practitioners,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:18.280
 because physical is one of the very strong habitual, karmic habitual to any practitioners

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.160
 at that time. And so when it is connected to that physical things, then it is, depends

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 with the realisation of the practitioners. If the very high realisation of the practitioners,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.480
 definitely, then they can cut through or they see this, you can display, if the pain is

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.880
 not really become as suffering.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:01:01.000
 So this is not really dependent, like true pain or sufferings, I think is just a part

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.760
 of the display there. But then also some of those good practices, really good practiciness,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.160
 so often then they use that as even not cutting thoroughly immediately there, but yet they

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.040
 use that situation as the increasing, they move each other, activities such as exchanging

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.400
 and equalising, exchanging, and those are really tapping, so then use that as the part

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the practises, the meditations, so it's not just going to throw only the sufferings,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:02:02.400
 each other, talk for the beings and use that situation, so those are the many good practices.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.200
 I think it's really good to apply, even it's not so, become so comfortable, so strongly

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.560
 that this exchanging body is really good to think that. And then also, when some of the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.160
 meditations, Buddha Dara or the only Buddhists, so this pain is become not pain to me, and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.080
 I think it's really good to find that, to really kind of add that attention, it makes

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.720
 more powerful to purify the karma at the same time, then also wishing up by my sickness,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 may the other beings sickness the free heat, and kind of trying to cultivate more body

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 to the thought, even the big practice, those are the really teaching set to that. But then

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.280
 once in a while we can apply, also the pain is just an illusion, it's just mental display,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.520
 so trying to also evoke that realisation also as much as we can during those feelings, and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.200
 those are all known as taking care of that situation with Dara, with the practises.
