00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 There are two meditations. The first meditation is meditating or inviting the worldly fire deity,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.120
 according to the teachings here. The worldly fire deity is inviting it to the fire by offering.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.100
 And of course also all obstacles, diseases, sicknesses are completely pacified, or please

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.680
 pacify all those obstacles. Then when that happens, the second is known as the fire puja

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:41.000
 of the beyond samsara. So that one may mean that the fire puja of the within the samsara

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 fire puja beyond the samsara. Suppose it is fire puja worldly deity, the fire deity of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.680
 the worldly, invited by offering that is the fire puja of the samsara or world. And the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.520
 second offering is the fire puja which is beyond the samsara. At that time, we are inviting

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.360
 or visualizing Vajrasattva, exactly as what we visualize ourselves, within the fire and

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.480
 then we make offerings. And that means not just only this fire puja or fireplace is become

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:27.880
 Vajrasattva's mandala, but our self is Vajrasattva. And the whole universe is transformed, or wake

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 up to the organ nature status. Reality level, actually there is nothing to transform. According

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.040
 to Vajrayana teaching, or any other teaching, it is already enlightened status. That's what

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:53.720
 in the teaching is often named vajra song, vajra song, vajra mind. That is the organ level,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.160
 that is the pure. So when we are meditating in practice as Vajrasattva, that skillful

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:11.360
 method is immediately dispelled of our duality hindrance. Instantly dispelled, we come back

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 to the organ nature status. So it is more than transform, it is just waking up to that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.820
 nature status. When we are in a duality status, we are in a sleeping status. If it is below,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:39.920
 we don't see things because duality diluted or diluted. But when duality is finished,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.480
 the organ of purity in light state is right here. So therefore, we see the power is the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 mandala of the Vajrasattva. We are the mandala of Vajrasattva state. The universe is become

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.880
 the mandala of the Vajrasattva. And then also we are talking about increasing our bodhicata

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.040
 during applications. As I said, this lineage teaching is very special. It is according

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.200
 to teaching, Buddha Chagamuni accumulated three countless eons. Then finally he become

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.080
 Buddha-enlightened. And what he got the Buddha or when he reached the enlightenment, reached

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 the Buddhahood, what he shared his realization, his understanding, his experience to us. That

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.000
 is so special, so beautiful. Then this is not just that happened, but Buddha came 2600

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 years ago. Still the light of Dharma is here. Why? Because of lineage. All lineage masters,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.960
 all lineage practitioners, their joy and devotion, courage and commitment, really they preserve

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.880
 it. Not just they preserve it, they become that. The actual lights truly become their

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:17.440
 peace, symbol of peace themselves. Happiness, joy, contaminant. Don't eat earth, humble,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:26.480
 happy, yet powerful courage and commitment, confidence, confidence, understanding of everything.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.520
 That is how these lineage masters or lineage practitioners continues. Today we connected

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.220
 to that. In particular these Vajrasattva practices is very special, very special in the new

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.120
 Buddhism.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:47.400
 It is called Mendelung lineage, great master Mendelung, his teachings that continually carried

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.160
 on until now. That is not just only the teaching we have, we have the practice we have interested,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.400
 but we have opportunity to practice this here every year in the new year days by the kindness

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:10.440
 of Jung, really. This is not just also, not just Kanukayo, how many, I mean Niyo is called, I think

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.440
,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.880
 the biggest city of America or the United States. How many people drain the fire pooja in their

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.400
 houses? Do you think? If you say, "I like to do fire pooja in your fire pooja," the devil says,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.200
 "What, are you crazy?" I'm sure really they will say, "I'm not just joking." If really you do,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:42.120
 they will call you 911. Immediately you went somewhere, or we have to go somewhere. This is

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.160
 going to be over and over and over and over again. Jung's, his courage and commitment, his kind of

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.640
 big

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 heart. Really, we're doing this right here. Everything is so good that we all have this

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.480
 opportunity. Again, take these opportunities. We really do this with both each other, with Jung,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.600
 to everyone. Really, we wish this to everyone, to the country, to the city, to the world, to

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.240
 everyone,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.800
 really remove and pacify. I mean, we join this place. You know that what we pacify,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.080
 what we want, what we like to increase. It's nothing but love and kindness, compassion, joy,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.960
 and oppression, to all living beings without any discriminations, or bhiyas, how grateful it is,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.280
 how spiritual. If we do small things like this, we say, "Oh, how great this is." It's true, it's

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.000
 great. A real open heart by the kindness, what's the mind of the Buddha's teaching? We have this

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.440
 opportunity. We're doing this, at least for a short time. It's wonderful. It's special. So, bring

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.680
 up

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.080
 all those really beautiful attitudes. Again, we're thankful, we're grateful, with every level,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.800
 and then also we are here, we're together, we're quite well and quite okay. It's great. Our life

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.640
 is breaking, our life is priceless. You all know. For gathering here and performing this ceremony,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.240
 it's again beautiful, spiritual, as the Buddha said, eating endowments. I mean, every level is

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.880
 all covered with very precious, rare, r-a-r-e, I believe, rare situation, getting together, we're

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:29.000
 here. How beautiful it is. I like the joy and appreciation. Many times, due to our ego killing

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.400
 it, we ignore the goodness. We ignore the goodness. We ignore the goodness. What we added up,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.040
 disappointment. It's not practical. When we have something, we have to highlight, it's good.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.600
 It's rewarding to ourselves, encouragement to ourselves. It's opening our heart, it's good.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.960
 Then if you don't, I'm not just the only good, but it allows, again, modern scientists,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.720
 many of us say that if you bring the positive energy, that will kind of create such beautiful

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:09.160
 health systems, all those new new systems, cells, and everything become very bright and bright.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.640
 Really, they're talking those. I mean, that's a great procedure. Buddha made it a long time ago.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.120
 Many

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.320
 masters make it all the time in the teaching. But now, scientists will be improving that too.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:26.680
 So therefore, all these police, again, reactivate the good things, and with all those beautiful

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:34.280
 more awakened, and then we do these practices. The practices, and now we begin. First, we do

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:42.760
 this inviting, worldly duty. How, again, I will try to translate this roughly into

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:54.520
 English, and I'll do this. First, I'll do the preparation of this ceremony. Again, the five

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.840
 with a little bit of blessings and all the things. So then, we do the ceremony.
