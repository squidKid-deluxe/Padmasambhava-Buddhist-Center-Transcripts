00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 Again, Shanti Deva's teaching, his own words' teaching, said, "Until now, for a long time, from the

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.240
 beginning of times, we are always thinking of our own self. All the time, always thinking of our

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.010
 self. But today, we reverse that. Today, not just only thinking of our self, but we are going to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.740
 think of all the beings, their well-being, their situation, circumstance, thinking of how to make

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.980
 them happy."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 How they make happy, or peace, and joy. How they will perform the suffering, the difficult troubles

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.880
, as I wanted. So, we are thinking of others. Therefore, this wondrous attitude didn't really shine

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.840
 in the egos, in the territories. Today, we are shining, letting that sunshine come in the territory

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.980
 of the ego. It's one of the very beautiful moments, beautiful things. How wonderful things I did.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.130
 How beautiful I did. I met meaning for my situation. I'm going to now follow all those great

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.510
 Masters who make peace, happiness, joy, to all living beings. I'm following the Buddhas, I'm

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.030
 following the Manjushri, I'm following the materials, I'm following the Arya Avalokiteshara, and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 all those great bodies are those Masters, the lineage. Master, everyone, I'm going to really follow

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.440
. They're similar.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.050
 I've been in that part of their medulla, in that group. How wonderful. I'm going to make this. Also

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.320
, my nature is like that. My nature is love. My nature is compassion. My nature is intelligence. But

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.260
, however, the ego-cling spoiled so many lifetimes.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.980
 Today, I rest and I wake up this beautiful nature. And how beautiful. I'm never going to dilute

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.540
 this letter, fall again in that ditch of the darkness state. I'm continuing to keep the sunshine of

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.520
 my inborn body to the light. Sunshine in my total environment. How wonderful that.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.330
 So, that is what is known as the meditating of the joy of ourself. And, feel that, as I said those

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.680
 things, and I'm going to join again teachings of the Shambhidevas. Exactly the meaning there. So,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.960
 we're all meditating in the joy of what our deeds and what we are now.
