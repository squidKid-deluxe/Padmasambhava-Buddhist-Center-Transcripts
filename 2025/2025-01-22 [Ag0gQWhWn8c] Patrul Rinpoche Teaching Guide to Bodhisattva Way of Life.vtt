00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.010
 Rinpoche moves through teaching on the bodhisattva, Karyāvatara, or the guide to a life of the bod

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.600
hisattva.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.440
 He teaches so many times in so many places that, particularly, I think, Baba Ling is teaching that

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 in the summertime.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.700
 And then so many people come to this day, and they're sitting on the open field, even the teachings

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.000
.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 So then, many times, or after teaching, he will let everyone do meditation, silence meditation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 And when you do Jain, and there's one verse in the guide to a life of bodhisattva.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 He says, "You, this board of the body, cross the river of the samsara,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 you never know when we will get this board again, board again, and don't misuse this board."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And they joined that verse, and then everyone taught himself and everyone to meditate.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 I heard that. And it's very... that's what the Raphalam translated, learning.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 So that, everyone said, really joined that, and he used this meditation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 This life is so precious and so important.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We have that precious life, that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And this for people's purposes is really so, so special.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And we're making very special, and we are voting to ourselves.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Or I treat myself, but I went to the Raphalam and I had my dearest, but every year, this life,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 this precious life, you're treating so big to yourself.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Not just that you're treating, I mean, we're treating, not just you, we're treating to the others.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Too many things. It's so special.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.540
 And this great Muslim Raphalam would really give the teachings of this guide to where life's so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.000
 important each time.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And there is really, never had before that area, there is always come the very big yellow flowers.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Yellow flowers, every time, comes and those are called pro of the guide to where life's important.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 We heard the student named them, because any, you never saw that flower before.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And then come that, that, so, so that is the, as I mean, blessings of this great teaching.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And that it will be my show particularly. Thank you everyone, everyone.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone for participating.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 We do short again, very quickly, and then very quickly. Thank you.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Thank you.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Thank you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Thank you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Thank you.
