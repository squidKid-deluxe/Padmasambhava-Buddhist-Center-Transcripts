00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Silence]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 which is one of the beautiful things that we can do in our lives.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 Of course, we have so many beautiful things we do, and we well do, and we are doing,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 but among that, touching to our own treasure, our own heart, treasure is the most important.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 It's standing very tall among all our activities.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It is also very powerful, things all the time, not just once in a while,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 or a short time, but touching to our own heart, and developing good qualities with heart and mind.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 According to the greatest teacher, Vodhachakkha Muni teaching,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 it will continually bright up our lives and our destinations.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Not just only ours, but also for all the things too.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Some really, because of our bodhicitta motivation, our kindness, our understanding of what we got,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.260
 the wisdom, knowledge we received from the greatest teacher, Vodhachkha Muni, and all the lineage

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.000
 masters.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 We put that as much as touch or put in our heart, it is really so powerful, so beneficial.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It is rewarding, it is soothing, it is also healing, it is so powerful.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So therefore, again, it is a very beautiful situation.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 For that reason, again, we are going to inspire ourselves with joy and appreciation,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 and either those qualities, at the same time, bodhicitta, kindness, compassion, thought,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 for all living beings without any boundaries and distractions.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And then trying to see all sorts of things, how everything is a beautiful state,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 according to Vedayana teaching.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And that's because we have practiced Vedayana teaching.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Mostly us, we are practicing Vedayana teaching.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Vedayana teaching opens it, everything is enlightened state.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Not just that we are, I mean, it's true, I'm not just that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 But for that reason, we immediately visualize or be ourselves as different Buddhas,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 known as visualizations.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 That is our practice, that is the goal.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 You have to become, not just become the deity Buddha, short time or well,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 we have good concentration, we become the Buddha, and then we kind of fall back to where we are.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Now, no, we like to stay in that state exactly as it is.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 That's the Buddha taught. Everyone is in that organ status.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 So those all kind of good God, those taught, the motivation is really important,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 and so, so necessary, important.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And with this, then again we go to the great Cheat Master.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 W. Dunyurung which is teaching on this, that which is known as Heart and Wise, for the 14 months,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 by His Holiness, W. Dunyurung which is, or W. Dunyurung which is.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And this is very short, of course we see, it's quite short,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 but it is really touched to the core of the Davari practice that what Buddha taught.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Of course, in the Buddhism, there is a practice such as starting the Buddhism

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 as intellectual levels, levels, but this is not just an intellectual level,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 it's observing the knowledge of what we learn into the heart and the mind to make better.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 This is a very powerful instruction, something that we can touch and keep easily and improve.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So we are going that this through, through this we went and we are going through that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 slowly by slowly, in a more, also kind of like in a way, meditating status.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Short time explanation or thought as a reminder of our practices, then practices.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 This we are kind of alternating the teachings and practices,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 and as part of the big goal as healing practices.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Healing practices, not just a healing for the what is happening situation now,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 but healing for all the significant difficulty, troubles, upruled,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 post-truth, noble truths, suffering truths, causal suffering truths.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 That's the really we are doing these practices.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And then eliminating that or despairing that, that, that for that reason with these practices.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Now we are going to do this, as we mentioned, the whole practice can be summarized

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 as into three novels, beginning novel, middle novel, and concluding novels.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And the beginning novel is the motivations.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Again, the activated motivation, such as a foreign or secure thought,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 technical ruffles, developing the bodhicata, and the very strong devotions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 That's kind of, devotion is talking of the practices.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Have that really kind of sibling quality of the devotions, combined together.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 That means the whole is completely connected, not simply separated there,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 but devotion is on the top.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And that we are going, we are going to inspire ourselves.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 We are going to also see how precious is, how important is, how richness is.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Every aspect is richness and so precious.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Lineage is so precious.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Teaching is so precious.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Brother Dharma is so precious.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Our life is so precious.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Our situation, self-confidence, opportunity, whatever, is so precious.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 The old pressures are gathered to us, bundled up, we are believing,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 completely, for our own payroll, our own payroll, to better the fulfillment.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 And we ignore that.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Then we are really going to lose.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 We are going to lose.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 I call it the greatest teacher, Buddha Kakyamala teaching.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 We've been lost so many times, from the biggest time, until now.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But now we're bouncing back our own ground.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And we are recapturing our dominions.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 We are turning back to our own sweet home, the home sweet homes.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 To read that, that is what really is.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Motivation, all this so important.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Joy, precious and devotions and all that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Devotions are not just kind of dogma or something, kind of like told dogma,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 or kind of like high aqua, what they call it, high aqua rockies,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 high aqua rockies.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 It's not at all.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 We see the value and the importance of every aspect.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 That is really the devotions.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Every aspect, so precious, so sweetly, so beautiful.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 We don't have to be more watery than to someone else.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 We have each of us, we have that precious.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 To ignite that, recognize that, acknowledge that, that is our responsibility.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Your responsibility and my responsibility.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Value in him.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Because of that, it's going to make the performance of what we are, our gain and blessings.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Our gain and desires, it really will make performance.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 So, the one that will perform it, it will break in performance of all the six water members.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Actualizing body, that it will bring to actualizing.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Otherwise, actualizing will become almost a kind of lip service or mouth service.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Just saying that is not.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 We are going to absorb that.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 And we become more practical.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 We have that other precious attitude and feelings.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 We are going to do something more bigger and more important, more deeper meanings.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Then you are wasting our whole valuable time in the situation, the circumstances.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Something completely kind of like short, temporary, kind of bubble like benefits.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 That is not.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 It's not that smart.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 So, therefore, all that motivation is so important.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 With that, then actualizing body.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Actualizing body, then now we will talk about the six paramana practices.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 As I said that earlier, and you all know, the entire teaching of the Buddha Dharma.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Buddha Dharma, when we come to the practice, is all can composite in the six paramatas.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Entire teaching of the Buddha.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Teaching.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Whether it is the Theravada teaching, whether it is the Sutramayana teaching,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 whether it is the Dantramayana teaching, all that teaching concluded within the six paramatas.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Everything in the six paramana teaches.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So, this time we are going slowly by slowly of the six paramatas.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And after that they are trying to bring some kind of, as I said earlier, just now,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 that we are doing practicing and also learning in a way.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Or in the teaching often said, studying and practice togetas.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Sade and practice togetas. That is what union, that's union.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 We are doing this Sade and Duba or Prasad in practice for the healing purposes.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Healing purposes are now one of the difficult trouble of going in the Samsaru, in war.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 We are going there.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 But deep down we are doing this healing purposes for all to remove the suffering.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 True and cause of suffering took every living beings.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 That's what we are doing.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Wider views of the body tellers.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 So now with that, among the six paramana, we went post to paramatas,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 which is generously paramata and morality paramatas.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 And now we are still going on the third paramata, which is the patient paramatas.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Patient paramata is so important, so powerful,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 is so crucial in the samsara.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 In the samsara, when we like to come out of samsara.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And the samsara has so many challenges, the difficult troubles that we know.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I don't have to talk.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 I mean it's not something that happened because the Buddha said that, it's not.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 The samsara has so many troubles.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Really challenges the difficult troubles.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 We have to go jungle, jungles, ruins, jungles, ruins,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 and all the, what's called, discursive or the obstacle courses.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 One after another, like there are so many troubles.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Our precious life, precious time, precious situation is going through those canals,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 through channels, through ruins, through passages.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Really good.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 There are so many troubles.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Outly, inwardly.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Outly, all those so many things, I mean you all know.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 In inwardly, talking about all these emotions.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 This negative emotion is our own creations of the duality mind,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 but it's always waiting us to attack.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 They are like waiting as hyenas in the African jungles.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Or they can't groove, looks like they are naive, they can't do extremely that,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 but they are very precious.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 They really going to attack.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 If you look, facing to those emotions of these hyenas,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 they may be back up immediately and kind of goes back.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 But as soon as we have lost the mindfulness and we destruct it, it come back.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Come back and attack.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 That is really this samsara is just full of that we have to do.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Now we doing this patient practice because our group,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 this negative emotion, fundamentally speaking, that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Fundamentally or genuinely speak of that.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 We like to uproot this this.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And therefore, then we have to be courageous.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 We like to perform the six paramatas, like to perform them.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 How important we generous this.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 That teaching said we went through those, so important.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 It's really so important.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 And then the morality, so important.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 The morality encompasses the entire teaching of the Buddha.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 But our teachings, but we don't have the patient.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Even we did practice of the generous and the morality.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 We are knocking down all our efforts.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 All our, in a way, joyful walks.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 We really smashing knocking down by our own self.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Therefore, patient is so important.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And that is, of course, we went through this.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Now I go over those.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I say, so I mention to you, and also you know,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 I mean, it's not something I tell you, I say to you,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 and then you know that or you knew.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 That's an art case.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 I'm telling you that because I'm reminding.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 I'm reminding what I learned from my teachers

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 and as well as from the books.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And also you do so many teachings from many great masters,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 and you read the books too.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 So we all know this. It's not something that we don't know.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 It's a kind of, we know it's all, it's kind of in the wake of our memories.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 All is in our fire of the memories.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Today we are bringing up, trying to bring up this.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Because of the opportunity, because of the light of the His Holiness,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 the universe, Ojabji, the universe, teaching.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 To bring up that up.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 So we talked about this, I'm with the sixth fire of the Mother,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 the patient.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Already I said, so now I go to this patient.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Again, as in the teaching said,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 the patient can be divided into three.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 The first is, I already said, about three times.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Yesterday, or even yesterday, that patient can be,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 not can be, it is divided into three.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 The first one is, never mind, patient of the never mind.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 That's what I'm translating.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 I'm translating, otherwise in Tibet it is,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 novrila jimanyam zopa, or lord of the zopa, lord of the zopa.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So I, so that means, again if I translate it literally,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 trying to translate, that means patient those to the hum doors.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Patient to the hum doors.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 That is what is the first one.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Second is, patient of the willingness to take the,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 patient of the willingness to go challenges, or the troubles.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Or in other words, in the teaching also said,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 chivsallala kapji zopas, patient for the dharma practices.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Patient for the practice of dharma.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 That is chivsallala kapji zopas.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Third is, is sammi kona matapu zopa.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 In it a bit.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 I have translated it roughly into English.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Said, not scared, patient of not scared,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 with profound meaning of the teachings.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Meaning of the teachings.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 So those are the three divisions of the patients.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 First is, is mostly related with it, on the surface.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 First one is that challenge is on the surface, in a way.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 There is surface of the, on the subject,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and surface that in object, and surface that in subject.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And object level is challenge that coming from outside.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Difficults are outside.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 So this is out, object as object.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And challenge that coming from even, is our own emotions.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 It's kind of interrupting.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Also not interrupt, opposite interrupt, but erupting.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 It's erupting.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And erupting, bouncing up, bouncing up, and up.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 So this is, there is challenge both out and in.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 We need come the challenge of this.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And the teaching said,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 the challenge is not just going to come by only through outside.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 We think, oh that person is, that someone did obstacle,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 or someone did this.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 But there is no, what they call here, Zen Koyin, said,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 there is no sound of the one, one, one palm,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 or clapping one of one palm.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 There is no sound.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 It's true, there is no sound.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Two palms have clap or pull sound to come,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 but one palm, there is no sound.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 So there is not really welcome, only outside.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 When it comes, what do you hear in western states?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 50-50s.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Almost it's 50-50s.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And we like to pay, or we like to be reasonable there.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Maybe then 40-60s.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Or 65 and 35s.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 That's just the way we are making compromise too much.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 I don't know if we made that kind of voting, voting.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 I don't know if we're going to win.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 It's going to say, it's pay is 50-50.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 50-50.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So that means, when we get upset in the emotion,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 we become all that, that person did this, that kind of like,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 almost we are blaming to that person, 100% the one trying to.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Realically, it's not, exactly.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Exactly really like that.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 So therefore we have to be paid, paid.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 This is the recording in the Buddha teaching,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 he said, more kind of practical, analytically,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 analytically, intellectually trying to bring more patient.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 How we bring the patient, intellectually this.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Intellectually trying to bring, we compromise.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 We're smart, we're educated.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 We're knowledge, trying to compromise.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 It's true, it's not making up things, it's not true.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 It's true.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 So we have to compromise.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Compromise that.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And so it's mostly 50-50 on that 60 parties.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 And then now, and we follow with that reason of the party,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 50 or 80 of the 60-some reason, and we clash with that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Then what it becomes?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Again, think, intellectually, analytically think.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Then it really created troubles, as we went yesterday

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 and the day before, you know how.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Then it created big troubles.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 On this ultrafast level, on all the levels it created troubles.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Troubles, it destroyed the hormones,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 destroyed the peace, destroyed the apprenticeships,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 destroyed so many things, one after another.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 That destroyed.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Maybe those, for example, we say analytically, again,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 we say 40 and 60 and 60, 60, 60, kind of like maybe, arrows.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 But 10 percent, we overslept it and did, and actually we destroyed.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 So that is not a wise, not a smart.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 For small purposes, small gain of the short time, maybe,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 and destroying the big things for long range.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 That is not a walk of the smart.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 That opposite of the smart, what's that called?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 If I say the name, I don't know many people like that.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 What's called Polish, no?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Polish.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Polish, oh, poor, poor.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 I don't know which we are going to put to our name, to ourselves, or Polish.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Polish.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 That is not a correct name, and they won't like that.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 But the way they be like or not, they redo that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Really, when we kind of play intellectually, analytically, everything,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 we are making not smart choice.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And they deep down, according to the teaching.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Then we create the karma.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Big karma.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Heavy karma have to play.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Even the anger itself, what in the teaching said,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 anger is the primary cause to go the three low ranks,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 to take the bird in the three low ranks, particularly in hell ranks.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 The anger is the primary cause of that.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Not just in the Greek state, but in the city.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Don't mention to get anger with the humanness or the someone,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 but even you get anger with the piece of twit.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Twit of the firewood.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Twit of the firewood.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 If you get anger, it is not wholesome.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 It is unrighteous.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 There is very little stories in the Buddha teaching.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 I will tell that.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Tell that.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 This is again, as we all heard in the teaching,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 the Buddha went to the heaven to repay back to his mother.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Mother is kindness.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Because mother was passed away,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 seven days after, right, the Buddha chakra man is birthed.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 The prince is birthed.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 She passed away.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 When she passed away, she took the bird into the heavens.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So, you read when she born, she took the bird into the heavens.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Immediately, she had a will where she come from,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 what situation that happened.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 In the Buddha teaching, she said immediately,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 those gods had the capability to see their previous lives and all things.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So, she see and she saw all everything.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 And because she saw the Buddha,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 in the teaching she said many times,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 she are kind of supporting, helping, watching,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 where the Buddha is meditating six years,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 not in the real, not in the real universe.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 All the time, she was helping and supporting.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 So, anyway, when Buddha reached enlightenment and become old,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 when he gave it to turning the will of dharma and all that,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 in the one time, I made it short,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 that Buddha went to the heaven and did three rainy season retreats

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 after she went to heaven.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And then Buddha stayed a little longer

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 than after the retreat in the heaven.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 So, in the teaching, he said all the human disciples,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 in the human world, and particularly in the shavastha area,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 so many devotees are really Mr. Buddha,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 and everyone started asking where is the Buddha,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 and then he said the Buddha is meditating all up into the heaven.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 So then one time, they came to the mongal putra,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 who is also that who was in the shavastha, Jettavan Grove,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 and he asked, "Please, Mongal putra is among all the Buddha's aharas,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 or the disciples, he had the most power of these realizations,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 or spiritual power, or the miraculous powers."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So they came to Mongal putra and asked,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 "Please, won't you go to Buddha and tell to Buddha we miss so much,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 and we heard you in Gharsevan,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 but Gharse can come on this earth to visit us,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 or we can go to the heaven to see the Buddha,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 so therefore, think of us and please will return to this death."

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And so, Mongal putra went immediately.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And the teaching said that youth has the healthy person.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Healthy person, youth has the person.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 The moment they square the hand,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 like arms square and bending, that duration of that,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Mongal putra can go the whole one time or three times,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 the whole universe one time.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 He can go in that moment.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 So he has more speed light,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 more power than the speed of light.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Light, that he can go, that moment.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 So then, Mongal putra accepted the request of the devotees of the Yara Sata,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 he went in to get to heaven.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 And we appointed them, and Buddha said,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 "Yes, I will come this day," and all that,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 and they come back, Mongal putra come back immediately

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and inform them.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 So they're so excited.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 So that's the, like, reception of what's called the anniversary

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 celebration of the Buddha descended from the heavens.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 So when Buddha descended from the heavens,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 there in the teaching said there is a very, very famous naga king,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 king of naga.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Naga king is known as ejli yarpo eli dhamma, eli dhamma.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 So king of the eli dhamma, naga king.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And he wanted me that he was,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 this naga king, he's the king,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 but yet, on the top of his head,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 growing tree, top of his is growing tree.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Tree.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 So he is disciple of Buddha too, he was.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 So he like to come to see.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 See.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 But he don't like to come to see Buddha in his really poems,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 his own poems.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 He like to come to see Buddha,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 he emanated or changed his poems like to come,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 like to come and to see the Buddha.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Buddha.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 So he changed his poem,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 as magnification of the universe came,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 can't vary tremendously for minutes.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So he came and back in for the reception of Buddha,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 reception of Buddha from the heavens.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Heavens.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Everybody started looking who is this, who is this person.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 They never know that.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 They never know.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 They never saw that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 They kind of, everybody was kind of talking that.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 But anyway, so Buddha came.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Finally we Buddha came,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 don't, and then, and everyone was joyfully received.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And there is another story there too.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Ahatopali.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 It's Bhima Ahatopali.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And she also changed her role,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 because she can change,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 because she has made it as a power,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 because she can change her poems

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 and different kind of take the poem,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 like emanated poems she can take.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And she came, emanated poem.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Why she did?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Because it all, we Romans are always second person,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 second kind of lines.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And Buddha comes again.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Of course we can be at the front row of the lines,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 and we have to be second.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 So today I'm going to change my poem

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 and receive Buddha immediately at first.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 So she changed the poem and that.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 So anyway, that's another story.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 But anyway, so when that come,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 and so everybody.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And then Buddha came and Buddha saw that,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 they said, you know, walking, looking.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And Buddha welcomed him and he welcomed Buddha.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 And the Buddha said,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 why you don't come with your own poems?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Our greatest teacher, if I come my own poem,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 no one will be happy with me,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 instead they will be scared with me.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 No, they won't be scared.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 You should show your own poem.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 That will help to the others.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Others.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Because that will help others.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 So as the Buddha encouraged when he showed his early poems,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 so then they see big tree is growing in the head

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 of the big kind of like serpent looking poems.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And Buddha said, look at this what?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 They all say, how that happened?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Why is it happening like that?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And they all start, and Buddha said that.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Ancient time, second Buddha,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 or third Buddha of the 14th Buddha,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 the Kashyaba Buddha, Kashyaba times.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 And there is one hungry demon

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 who is meditating on the jungles and the woods.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 He's meditating on the woods.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 One time he's coming to the city for some reason,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 he's going to look,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 and that his robes are caught by the twigs.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Twigs.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And he walks fast and he tells the robes.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 The robes.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 And he gets so upset with that tree, or that twig.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 He cut it.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Because of that anger,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 because that even he was born as the king of the Nagas yet,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 that karma couldn't live because of that.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 So that's the really teaching, that anger has no values.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Of course we won't see that immediately.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But consequence is so deep and so strong.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Therefore, again, then,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 believing on the teachings,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 believing on the karma,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 believing on the cause and the effects,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 and be mindful,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 is the then practice of the debate.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And then another analytic way, thinking that.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 And what the great Master Chanti Devas said in the teaching.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And so why you get upset with others?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And of course we say,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 they are not he or she.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 She hurt me.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 She hurt me.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 That's why you get angry.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 But then when you get sick, you're not getting angry.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 When you get sick,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 as I say, all yous,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 and they say in the teaching,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 whenever you say, when we get sick naturally,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 or we get sick, we're not angry.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 We try to solve the problem,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 or cure the sicknesses,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 not get angry.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Angry.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 So that when you say, asking,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 because when I get sick, I don't get angry,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 I have no choice.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 No choice, I get sicknesses.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 But when the other person does something to you,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 so you get that anger to that person,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 but that other person's dream is not the primary cause.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 What is the cause?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Their emotions.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 We really like to challenge it,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 like to be challenged or like to hurt.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 You have to hurt the emotions, not the people.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 People that have no choice

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 become as serving tools, as a little robot,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 robot by the negative emotions.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 The counter-mental cause of that,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 what the other person did,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 is negative emotions.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 So then, what point?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 You say that.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Feel compassion.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 There is a sick,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 sick of the negative emotions,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 intoxicated by the negative emotions.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And therefore, that people are acting that.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And that's why Guru is doing that,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 is creating negative karma.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 That's what indeed is really getting anger,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 feel compassion.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 That's the reason I have to activate my compassion

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 and both each other,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 or to benefit from this.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 All the sick persons.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Sick persons.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Same way, when I get sick,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 I'm not getting angry myself.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 I like trying to cure the disease,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 cure the cause of that disease,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 trying to make it, whatever that is.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Same way, help to that with your love, your kindness.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And be able to do that with our mindfulness.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 That is the supreme practices.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 What great Master Chantideva said,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 "There is no bad karma than anger.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 There is no supreme virtue than patience."

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Therefore, every means of the techniques

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 preserve the patient.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 That's what really, I'm going to cross it a little roughly.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 That works.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And we do that.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 We are the bodhisattvas.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 As for the day we were talking,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 sattva were courageous ones.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Truly you are keeping up the identity of what you are.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 The worship.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Or we are keeping up our warships.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 What that will do?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 That will please all the bodhisattvas,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 and all the bodhisattvas.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Our located shortness,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 menjushilis,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 vedya phanis,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 summon the bodhisattvas,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 summon the bodhisattvas,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and sae yinpo.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Dabat namsara, nampo yinpo.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 All those bodhisattvas and bodhisattvas are happy.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 And they are doing clapping, clapping, greeting.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 Really we are fulfilling a beautiful goal.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Truly we are lined up on the client of the warriors.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 How wonderful.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 How beautiful.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 At the same time, we are putting up our naked videos.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Our own kana, naked videos.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 We are accumulating the merits.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 We are getting closer and closer to our own finite destinations.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 Wow, wonderful.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Really, it's beautiful.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 That is what is known as meditation practices.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 So those are the analytic way to do that.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Then, more meditative,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 we are absolutely level.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Where that anger is coming from,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 where that anger is coming from,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 it's not a perfect emptiness.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Really emptiness.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 So all the tools we are teaching that you received,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 from the Mademaka, from the Duktin or Mahamudra teachings,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 immediately catch up by mindfulness, alakness.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Pray that, let it go, disappear.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 And that is known as meditation practices.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Patient practices.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 One patient practice again,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 say this like, never mind,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 or the patient for those who harm those.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Rules. Rules in the teachings is not disturbed.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Not disturbed.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 And also, not returning.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 So that means, not what we call,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 normal language, what we call in samsara, revenge.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Not disturbed.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Not have the thought of revenge.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Not holding the ill thoughts at all.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 That is good.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 These three are known as the perfect college of the patient, never mind.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Then many a times in the teachings,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 how we get upset or angry, many a times in the samsara,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 oh, that's individually hurt me in the past.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 And that's individually hurting me now.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 That individual has planned to hurt me in the future.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 That individually hurt my friend or my side in the past.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 And again, present and planned future.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 That individually has been so nice with my opponent's past

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and also nice now.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 And also, I'm sure that person will continue in the future.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Kind of having all those kind of different thoughts

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 of the analytic kind of circling in the illusory thought

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 of the duality mind of the ego-clinging and then anger's attitude.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Certainly that.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 That is known as ill thought.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Not wholesome thought.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 For if you started thinking those and get upset, angry,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 that what it does in the teachings, it really will completely destroy

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 our constitutional body too.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 It brings unhealthy.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 I will spoil all the elements.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Our compilations become ugly, hazardous and can't sleep also, even.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 It disturbs the sleeping.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 And then you create a so vague karma, heavy karma for the future.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 So all those things.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 I mean, there's so many beautiful teachings.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 You read the guide and ways of the lives of the bodhisattvas.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Really, really, just so beautiful, so practical.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 And so smart.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Smart.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 And also so compassion.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 So loving-kindness.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 So absolutely best for wellness

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 and those doing practice as we're discussing that.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 That's the one.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Those are the practice of the forever.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 And we don't have those this level each other in the teachings said about.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And they said, and we don't have even we have all the very kind of high teachings,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 deep teachings of the Jyotin or Mahamudra or the other teachings

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 that it really won't work.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 It won't work as what we thought it would like to be.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 So therefore, what really must happen, we say that, as I said earlier,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 I'm sure you also know too.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 If you have one thing, it will be enough to lead enlightenment.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 It's bodhicata.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 And we don't have one thing, no matter how much you have.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 You say, I have this and that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 That all become intellectual and just on the surface.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 And not sinking, it's not going to get anywhere.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Therefore, that is what is bodhicata.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 And for that reason, please be cherished and honored and keep bodhicata.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 A score of our heart, those are the teachings said.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 So that's what is so important.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And now, the second one is for this.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 The first one, I spoke about the first one.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 The second one is the patience for the practice of dharma

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 and the patience for the not scared with the profound meaning of dharma.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 And so those two are, I will again continue to talk also.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 I think it's taking time, but thank you again, thank you.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 And your body's ready.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 And thank you again.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Thank you for your passion.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Thank you.
