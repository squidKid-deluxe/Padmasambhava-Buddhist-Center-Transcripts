00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.190
 What we just mentioned, ground is our origin nature. Again, ground that is your nature, mind that

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.220
 is ground.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.020
 This means we all have this ground. Everyone. This ground is another terminology, Buddha nature.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.990
 Your nature of our mind, not just Buddha, but our nature, nature of the mind, the enlightenment of

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.900
 nature, all those synonyms.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:38.600
 We have that nature. Everyone has that nature. Because of that nature, then we start practicing.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.860
 Practice is known as path. Path, you can't in a way follow it, but it's not path external to that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 existing path, we know that.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.360
 It's all developed, discovered of our inner beauties, our natures, follow.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.000
 And to do this, again, with all those what I said, and you know, this beautiful motivation,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 beautiful intentions,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 beautiful and totally known second thoughts, devotions, both each other, rafujis, rafujis, and then

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.880
 practices,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 giant practices, silence practices. When it comes to the silence practices, then it's divided.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.280
 Samad meditation, Vipassana meditation. Samad meditation is at the first stage.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.900
 To Samad meditation, it will help us to settle down our mind, or even in our sessions at the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.680
 beginning of time,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.240
 maybe you can do for a few minutes or five, ten minutes, if you're doing a longer meditation, it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.280
 will be really Samad post.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.530
 Samad. Every time Samad is not resting very well in our mind, you use a concentrated object with

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.460
 concentrators,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.620
 some kind of object, external object or inner object as we went through those things, through those

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.880
.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.040
 And when the mind is a little more able to concentrate, settle down, and then release those

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.760
 concentrated objects and meditate.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.940
 Samad meditation, then just relax. Again, kind of hold that. That means, Samad, you're holding

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 something.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.360
 You're holding the focus, you're holding that stillness. That is, that holding.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.360
 You supported that to maintain that calm and peaceful status, or that calmness.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.660
 That is Samad, abiding Samad status. Once you're able to maintain that Samad,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.000
 you're able to maintain the mind more kind of peaceful status, that more now looks like that, and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 release your focus now.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.560
 Release the focus. Release it to any holding patterns. Lighten up that Yamata with Vipassana.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.560
 Vipassana is brain light within the Samad meditation. You're really lighten up. Lighten up that.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.050
 That's what in the teachings, not flit Samad meditation. Not flit, blame that. You're lighten up

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.960
 that. That is Vipassana. Vipassana.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.360
 When you came to that Vipassana state, there's no difference between Samata and Vipassana.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.890
 Merge Togit, Vipassana and Samata. Togit, that's called union of the Vipassana and Samad meditation

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.260
.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.460
 When you reach that ultimate calm and peaceful clarity, yet it is openness, a world state, that is

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.960
 the Mahamudala or the Dzogit.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.010
 Togit practices. Rest and relax in that state. You're dressed. And when you reach that state, why?

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.660
 Not distracted.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 That's what I said. Not distracted. We use all those different terminology. It's not just we use.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.760
 Those are the great masters, these great teachers, the Buddhas. They explain those things.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.730
 It will help us to usher us back to the old inner state, free from any dualities, those used, fresh

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.660
, natural carefreeze and self-liberating techniques.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.360
 Those all help us to bring back to that natural state. What is that natural state?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.620
 I said so many times and you have the text too. And you know that too. Other Dzogit teachings, we

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.560
 know that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:37.430
 But it is cognitive awareness and emptiness, combined Togit in one single state. That is the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.660
 natural itself.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.970
 And a simple word in the teaching was one. That is known as Rupa in Dzogit teaching. Rupa, the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.260
 fresh Rupa, old inner Rupa, unimpeded Rupas, the Saman Badar,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:01.540
 residing right in our heart center, in the nature of nature. Maintain that. How to maintain? Not

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.760
 distracted.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:14.280
 That is simple words, not distracted. And not regulating. Not regulating. Wanting these, not

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.160
 wanting these, that is the regulation.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.760
 That is not natural. Relax. During those times, even you are asking that state, bring on more joy,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.660
 more devotion.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:35.660
 Occasion, radio, any devotees. And also see everything is magic. Occasion, see everything is magic

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.960
 and dreams.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.760
 But how wonderful. How beautiful it is. Not just looking to the external as magic and beauty.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:53.790
 Our self, the looker itself is magic. Magic and dreamer status. All is in that status. Again, go

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.560
 back to that Rupa status.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:04.610
 That is the meditation. That is the practices. And that at the end, do the good, dedicating

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.560
 marriages.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.280
 Good dedication. We have beautiful those prayers and good dedication. Dedicating means reaching

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.560
 some of the good things to every living beings,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.220
 sincerely from your heart. Really, when I sit here for one hour, one hour, whatever I did, practice

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.560
 that.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:31.180
 Whatever the energy of good things come from this, I share that to everyone and I also distribute

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.560
 this to all, to every living being.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.560
 The cause of every living being is happy, joy and peace, their fulfillment and peaceful state.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.830
 And by the blessings of all, the Buddha is enlightened. With their blessings, with my attitude, joy

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.560
 and courage spread out to all, to everywhere.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:59.560
 We do it in your discoloration. Wish everyone things best, harmony, peace, nonviolence, good times.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.580
 Everyone. Peace, peaceful. Not just not only now, but continually that, until they become the

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.560
 Buddha.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.560
 Wish that. That is known as dedication and aspirations, good aspirations.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.830
 Then we complete beautiful practices, sitting practices, complete sitting practices and carry that

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.560
 energy, that flavor of the practices in the world.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.980
 To your day to day activities or the office. Okay, remember that. Even you couldn't remember all

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.560
 that time, but okay, you can try to remember that.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.830
 And out, bring back to the natural status. And it is strengthening your beautiful intention,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.560
 thoughts.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:53.560
 That is then known as the practices and that I completed these teachings of the great master.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:01.560
 Condensed essential highlight on the teachings of the great master. And so, that's it.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.560
 And then now I'm going to give two transmissions. If you will ask me to give the transmissions.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.750
 And I'm going to give transmissions of transmissions of the poor garlands of the precious teachings

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:19.560
 by Nkipa.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.560
 And then I will also transmissions of the three words that penetrate the heart of the Realization.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:35.560
 Heart of the Realization by Garab Durya, or by great master Parva Rambhuchas.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:45.560
 So I'll give this transmission and then we practice a little bit of our written daily practices.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:54.200
 And then we again with dedication and then I will give again blessings of this text, the teaching

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.560
 itself, like as text empowerment teaching said.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.560
 Nkipa asked me to do that, so I'm happy to do that, also blessings of that empowerment.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.560
 And that is my schedule this morning. Thank you.
