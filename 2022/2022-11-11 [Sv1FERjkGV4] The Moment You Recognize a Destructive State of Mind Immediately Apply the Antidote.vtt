This teaching became popular in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training are some of the most profound and effective practices for us to apply in daily life. They bring greater balance and harmony to everything we encounter. Mind training is widely practiced by Tibetan Buddhist masters and practitioners. It is a great practice of nonviolence and peace that powerfully ushers us straight ahead on the path of enlightenment.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training emphasize the practice of bodhichitta, the ultimate remedy taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava to entirely remove self-absorption by skillfully caring for all beings with boundless wisdom.\n \nSeven Points of Mind Training\n \n1.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 The moment you recognize it, immediately apply the antidote. Don't let it go far. Not immediately.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:19.950
 Whether it's anger, whether it's jealous, whether it's attachment. One powerful method all the time

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.600
 is compassion.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 Allow my kindness immediately and look at the nature of that emotions. That means when the anger

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.600
 arises, look to the anger.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.580
 Instead, looking and searching the reasons. Searching the reasons to that anger, well anger may be

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.600
 more group.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 But if you look directly to the anger, that will really stop. You're looking to the anger.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.260
 When you look to the anger, there's no substantial solid existing anger or attachment. Is mind

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.600
 displaced?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 And mind is empty. Again, same thing as we discussed yesterday and you know that.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 So is it? Display, look at display of the mind. Why I carry with that?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:19.850
 And with that, and immediately then, also may this anger, never this anger disturb all the living

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.600
 beings and really thought.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 And then that anger, or when it arises, also wish and pray, may that become a substitute for anger,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 all living beings.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 And so all living beings are free from the anger, such as anger or attachments.
