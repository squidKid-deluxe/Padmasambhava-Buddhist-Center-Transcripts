 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 "What's the difference between the two of you and me?"

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 We know that first is precious life.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Referecting this life is so precious.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 So beautiful. So spacious.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 It's much more spacious, much more precious than the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 diamond of the same size of the body.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Size of the body. It's more precious.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Referecting like that. And why we have to reflect?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 We didn't get this precious life without

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 any cause and conditions, without a good cause.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Therefore, feel happy in the job. At the same time, good determination,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 courage, and commitment that I'm going to really

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 make this more meaningful. To benefit to myself,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 to benefit for the others. What a gracious teacher

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 a Buddha had when he said in his teaching, "The dual purpose."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 For following one's own purpose and for following the purpose of others.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 That is the modem. That is the goal.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 That is our hallmark.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 How are we going to activate it? Pause, of course. I move these two.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 What do we have to do? Benefit to one's own self.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 It's more important. Once you have that, the second goal

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 is to benefit to the others. With the intention level,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 you can keep that. Always, from the very beginning, to benefit for others.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 But actively level, follow our capabilities.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 We discussed that really, and of course,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 you all know this very much, that.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 As I said the other day, we remind each other of this

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 kind of challenging, difficult times, so that our time of

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 this kind of situation can transform me into the practice

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 of dharma, something rewarded, so we can be happy.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 "Oh, I did all that situation, things that happened, but I really used

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 my sound so beautifully." I reward my growth

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 of the spiritual dharma realization. I use something.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 That is a win-win situation, and we do that.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 We will be happy, not going disappointed, all that.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Even we have difficult troubles. When we have the practice of dharma in the heart,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 our wisdom is so beautiful. Our wisdom is growing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Our wisdom is shining. The inbound wisdom shines so beautifully.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 We can solve the problems, and they really bring more

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 creativity. Oh my God, beautiful activity of the benefit

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 of one's own selfishness to others. So therefore, this is what

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 we really remind each other, each time, for a short time,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 every day, what we've been doing, and we will continue for a while.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 So that is spiritual life. And the second is

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 in parliament. We went yesterday, too. I mean, you all know that.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 In parliament, it is something that we have to go through. Everyone,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 doesn't matter your reach, or your pull, or your learning, or unlearned,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 you're very expert, or you're very beautiful, or you're

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 something very kind of luxurious, and skilled, and very kind of

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 uplift. Everyone is staying, standing,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 and sitting on these impermanent situations.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But this is always changing.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But this impermanent is also a great advantage.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 We use this rollercoaster. We can do the research on the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 samsara, gain the great skills and methods,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 expertise of our inner qualities, of loving kindness,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 the compassion, the wisdom, so that we can help to the others,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 benefit for all beings. We've become the beauty

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 and beacon of the samsaras. Every year, these samsara

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 are solely in parliament. As I said, surfing world.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Really, we use the skills. It's not going to barricade us in them.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 That is not just on the disappointment subject, but it is

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 the window and the door of the progress and the development.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 That is so wonderful. Beautiful. That's what all these

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 great masters, Buddha Shaptyamuni, everyone did.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 That's what they become. They are actually one of the beautiful symbols

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 of love and compassion, kindness, respect to all living beings.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Just really truly, that's what they represent. That's what they talk.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 That's what we try to follow as much as we can.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 That is really what is this environment. And also that is

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 among four, you know, session. That's two, first two.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And British life in parliament.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And next one is cause and effect that are inevitable.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And then samsara has difficulty, challenges, difficulties.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 These two are. That order of this, in many Mundo practices,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 always mentioned, the third one is samsara.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Challenge of the samsara. But what we use,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 what we practice of the short Mundo by His own Guru Ramaji,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 the order is, that order is, part one is

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 cause and effect that are inevitable.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So I'm going to follow with that order. Even though it really

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 doesn't matter. I mean, it's nothing big. I mean, difference at all.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Just at all. But I follow with this as short

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Hindus and stockings. So third is

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 cause and effect that are inevitable.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Now, so that means in a simple word,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 every, I use word, what that is, is karma.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Teachings on the karma. What is

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 teachings on the karma? That was the gracious kindness

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 compared to his first teaching among

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 the four noble truths. Suffering truth and cause

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 of suffering truth. That is what it is.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Suffering truth and cause of suffering truth.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 How the great teacher Buddha said, you must recognize

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 suffering truth. You must

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 give up or abandon the cause of

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 suffering truth. Suffering or

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 challenging and difficult is not arising by itself.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 It has cause. It has conditions.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 This is also that we see in the world

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 in samsara. So many beings we all

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 have different preachers, different

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 experiences, different lifestyles

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 and in different kind of places we say

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 it's all different. Why?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 It's not somebody created according Buddhism.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 It's all is one's own creation of the karma.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Karma is reflecting.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 All cause of suffering truth reflecting as karma

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 and happening all this. This larger level

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 is known as Buddhism interdependent coordination systems.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Everything is connected.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Everything has cause. Everything has conditions.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 This interdependent coordination

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 is what in the teaching many a time said.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 All things, all plumbers are come from the cause.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 That cause is told by the tathagalas.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Tathagalas. One who said that clearly

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 that is the great sage. One who said that

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 great sage. That's roughly translation.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 What do we usually normally chant?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 That is the teaching. Interdependent coordination.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 All phenomena. What means all phenomena?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 All phenomena, the samsara comes from the cause and condition

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 or interdependent coordination and all phenomena

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 in the manner comes from the cause and condition or interdependent coordination.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 For that reason, great master Nagarjuna

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 said in his teachings that nothing

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 is arising with all the interdependent coordination systems.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Nothing is arising.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Whether it's samsara, whether it's nirvana.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 What is interdependent coordination systems?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 All is emptiness.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 All is emptiness. So this related truth is nothing but

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 display of interdependent coordination.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 How that interdependent coordination system arises

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 is also follow the same rhythm, even though it's display of the illusion of medical

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 but it follows the system exactly what cause is.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 It follows the light and it follows the exactly result of that light.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Never changes. Not messing up that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 If cause in that, for example, if we blend it on the external level, every

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 speak, if cause is seed as apple seed

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 and blend the night soil part with the places, it will bring the

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 apple fruit.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 When you blend the seed of the apple, it's not going to bring

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 the fruit of the orange. Never going to bring.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 It's exactly. If that seed is part of the delicious with

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 soil area, particular night, it will bring the result golden delicious.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 All the gala apples. But even it is exactly

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 that full. It's not mixing. Not changing it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 That's how the external law of the interdependent coordination

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 systems works. Brilliant. Of course, you all know that.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 That just reminded me, all each of us.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And then in a level, everything is dependent again

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 with the same thing. Good cause

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and will bring good result. Or good cause of the motivation

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 will bring good result. If it's bad

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 motivation, it will bring bad result.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So this, again, now we talk about, particularly talking about the karma.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 That's something connected with our individualism.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 This karma is again, as already I said, and you all

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 best know that, but again reminding me.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Where is karma coming from?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 It's from the mind. It's not really coming from outside

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 anyway. It is from the mind.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And what kind of mind is? And mind is

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 again, great master and origin in teaching.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 If the mind is anger, or mind

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 is ignorance, and mind is attraction.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 If that, those kind of combination mind will

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 bring the unvirtuous.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Unvirtuous. So that means, unvirtuous.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Negativity. That becomes,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 cause of suffering truth.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Negative emotions are the cause of suffering.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 What kind of sufferings?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 We know anger, or we know ignorance.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 And when we are in an attachment, and with that combination,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 with that motivation there, when it is reflected externally,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 what it does? It hurts someone.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 It disturbs someone. And not just disturbs

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 someone when it is reflected externally, but even

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 ourselves, one who is anger, one who is in great attachment,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 one who is in great ignorance state, then we are

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 dilemma. That individual is dilemma. This individual is

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 confused. This individual is in dark state.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Dark state. And that reflect externally.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Then all the difficult troubles comes.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 But that is known as creation of karma from the mind

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 of negativities. Our negativity,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 mind, reflected verbally, physically,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 to the someone who is of kind of targeted and did that.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 According to the transistive of the negativities,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 and then it hurts so many beings

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 that hurt. Now karma is not ended there.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 That is the beginning, according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It is the beginning. Beginning.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 It is not ended there. It is the beginning.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 And then it will be continued. It is like ripple,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 waves of ripples that continually goes on and on.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And each time, different causes and conditions

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 clash with that and create more karma and then goes on

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 and on. That is known as negative karma.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 So negative karma is nothing but

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 creation of our own mind.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Mind. And then, on the other hand,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 the positives. Positives is also

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 a huge word, virtues and unvirtues.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Now the word. Now unvirtues is the, again,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 result of the negative mind,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 negative emotions. Virtues is, is then

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 result of the positive amount.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 And what is the positive mind? Opposite of those

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 three. The ignorance,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 attachment and angles. Opposite of them.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And when that means what?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Opposite of the ignorance is what? Versedums.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Opposite of the attachment is loving kindness

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 and compassion. And opposite of the anger is

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 again compassion, love. That is

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 all opposite of the attachment is detachment.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Opposite of the anger is

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 loving kindness and compassion.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And when the mind is in that state,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 in that state that the beautiful attitude in our mind

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and heart is reflecting that verbally,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 physically, that is known as activity

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 of the virtues. It is going to benefit someone.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Loving kindness and compassion versus activity

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 is not going to disturb anyone. It will help.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 But equally, love and compassion, activity guided by the wisdom

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 is just the right, perfect dosages. Whoever

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 needed help is not pushing, not kind of

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 imposing, but it is

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 perfect benefit. But that's what the reason, what Grace

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 kindness teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni said, "Do

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 help." Others are calling their readiness.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 That you understand, right? We understand that.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Readiness. That means even if there is something good and special,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 every kind of a little bushy, then it becomes not really benefiting.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Pity, it becomes resistible. Come. It's not accepting. You're not

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 actually really benefiting. Even our motivation is good and beautiful

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 thing, but every a bushy, every imposing, we are kind of opposing

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 that. Then it's not skill-forming. That was called

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 unskill-romance. Why that unskill-romance comes?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Because maybe we don't have enough

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 common sense, or we didn't use enough common sense.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Or maybe we didn't use enough on our intelligence, in

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 bonelessness. So therefore, do

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 help and support accorded readiness of others.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 At the same time, what the gracious teacher, Buddha Chakra Muni said,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 "Also, your capabilities. Even if there's something good and important

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 benefit, do your range of your own capabilities."

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So that means what? When we help and support you

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 to someone else, we should be also always happy,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 joy, peaceful, relaxed, calm, openness,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 mind. With that state, if we help, truly then it becomes very

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 beautiful. Also, help and look like that, so beautifully

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 outward, accorded readiness. Then it kind of goes

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 on. Your readiness, your capability will be, our

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 capability will grow, and their readiness will grow, and indeed

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 you will do the proper, perfect ways.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Perfect way. So that is what really known as the

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 virtues. So now these virtues, the non-virtues, both

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 are best upon their own

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 motivations. The negative

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 motivation is then un-virtuous.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And the positive virtues is then

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 positive mind or motivation is then

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 virtuous. Now, when we are talking

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 about the virtues and the non-virtuous, then that's that of course

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 I think you will know that. There is not as

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 the

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 virtue, sorry, non-virtuous,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 non-virtuous and

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 forbidden

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 non-virtuous or non-virtuous

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 and restricted non-virtuous.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 So now I use three non-virtuous.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 One is just a non-virtuous

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 and the other is restricted or forbidden

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 non-virtuous, two virtues. What that means?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Natural virtues,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 natural un-virtuous, sorry, un-virtuous or

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 un-virtuous

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 that is universally proved with negativities

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 such as killing, stealing,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 sexual misconduct, lying,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 deceiving, slender, gossip

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 and covetousness.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 No saying. And the violence is taught.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And completely closed our mind.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Those all known as

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 un-virtuous. Those all naturally un-virtuous.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Then I use the second terminology.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 The forbidden un-virtuous

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 or restricted un-virtuous.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Those are such as what I have to give.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 So many guidelines, rules.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Many of those are known as restricted un-virtuous.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Such as fully ordained monks

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 should not have upper known tools.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And also such as the Buddha used so many guidelines

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 of how the ordained monks

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 are going to eat. How they are going to sit. How they are going to

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 speak. And how they are going to choose even food.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Choose the food. For example, in the teaching always

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 this is just one example. Where you are eating food, we should

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 not move the food from one side

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 to the other side. So this side, where you are eating there,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 whatever spoonful, porkful you put in your mouth,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 not going to put that in the left side of this,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 I'm sure you see this, and this side, and they put this other side

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 immediately moving pork, pork, pork. And then also for the opening

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 mentioned in the teaching, where you are eating, not speaking so loudly.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Loudly. Or even not speaking.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 And food, so you should take food as medicines.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Food as medicines. Sustaining our bodies. Helping to our

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 cells of the body. All those, and how you

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 dress up your, of course there's not many dresses, but what you wear

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 loves, how you should dress. Those are all known as

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 restricted unvirtuous. Every

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 keep those perfectly is not unvirtuous.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 But if we kind of against it, and we miss those things, kind of

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 ignore that, then it becomes restricted

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 unvirtuous. And that is similar, for example,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 also in the laws, in the common laws, there is so many rules. When you

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 drive on the street, highways, some drivers say 55 miles

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 per hour. If you drive maybe 60, 85

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 miles per hour, that is then you've been beyond

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 the rules. Then you break the rules. Actually

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 reality level is nothing negative or anything like that. But

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 it has some reasons. They put the rules, 55 miles

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 per hour, or 65 miles per hour, or 75

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 miles per hour. Whatever they put, maintain that range,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 then we are perfect. It's not now, uh, unvirtuous.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 But if we break that rule, then we know police can stop

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 and they keep to get to us. That is, that is kind of like

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 similar, restricted, unvirtuous.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 So this is what we are all known as, and

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 this is what, when we do those things, what happens, whether it is

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 a virtuous or non-virtuous, what it does? Then we create

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 the karma. It creates the karma. Then karma is not

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 just going to, whether it is a virtuous or non-virtuous, it creates the karma.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Even the smallest karma of action can be

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 resolved. And in the Buddha teaching

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 making, for example, small sparking

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 fire can burn, burn whole

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 areas. There we know, in the Buddha teaching making,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 we see this so many times, those fires start from small

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 things, can be burned. And also even small things

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 can be hugely resolved, benefit, good things. So

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 therefore, what in the teaching said, even in the smallest things,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 if it is good, shouldn't they ignore? Do that. Be happy

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 with that. Even in the smallest things and negatives, trying to

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 don't also kind of ignore, and trying to avoid that.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Avoid that. That, if we do that, then what is that?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 That is known as mindfulness. Then we are keeping

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 perfectly. Everything is a bit of a perfect and a beautifulness.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Then when the karma is kind of rapid, it is not going to finish it.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 But then, as I said, it is going to go on and on.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 In the teaching said, the minimum karma

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 is going to go again and again 500 times.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 At least minimum. It could go over

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 500 times the result. One thing we did,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 one time we did, but it has a ripple effect of 500 times

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 minimum. Whether it is good or bad.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 So this is the really hard. It is also not going to

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 karma is not, according to teaching, is not going to be experienced by anyone.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 We cannot transfer that to anyone. We cannot share

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 that karma to anyone. Once, whatever we did, we will,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 whoever did that, that individual experience

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 clearly, soundly, or clearly with sound

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and brilliant with themselves.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Therefore it is for that reason, British teacher,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 the teaching, karma will not be experienced

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 by the water, fire, wind, earth,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 or cannot be transferred to anyone. Always, it comes

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 to one's own self. The truth. It will come back to the dual

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 itself. This helping could take so many years,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 so many years, but when the conditions are perfect,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 it will materialize exactly that.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 And for that reason, what again Buddha said in one of his teachings,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 to be told, oh, to be told to his disciple kings,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 oh great king, when you leave this world,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 nothing your retinues or your

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 lecturers will follow, except only the garment.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Karma will follow with you. What does that mean?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Our body is left behind when we die, for example.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Body is behind. It's gone. But what is

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 developed, who is going to take rebirth? It's consciousness.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 So karma is combined with consciousness.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Consciousness, it will go. And then it will go,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 as he said. It could be happened next lifetime, or

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 up to two times, or maybe many lifetimes, but it's truly

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 it will happen. Unless we start to purify,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 recognize the purify. Then in the teachings,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 if you start doing the purification practices, according to the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 teaching method, whatever you method we use, it will lighten the karma.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 It will lighten the karma as much as you do practice, and then can clear

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 with all the karma. But otherwise, it will wrap in,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 it will come on that anxiety to dual

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 itself. We're never going to

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 escape that. So that is my

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 brief talk. And karma is, again,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 is what? Suffering truth.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Karma is suffering truth.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 All truth of troubles, truth

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 of challenges. And what is the cause

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 of, whether we use technology, trouble, challenges

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 or suffering, cause is negative emotions.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Or positive thought

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 as it started from our mind.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Therefore, always it's kind of thoughtful with our actions.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Whether it's big and small, we thoughtful if we do that. That is also known

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 as discipline, gentle and peaceful.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Very beautiful, gentle, peaceful manner. So always

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 beautiful. It is a gentleman, it is a gentle lady.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 It's good, it's an ornament. Of course, all different

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 ornaments we have in the world. For when we are gentle, peaceful,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 mindful, more thoughtful, that is true,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 the beautiful ornament. That will be admired according to the brother teaching.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Even the gods, gods in Heavens,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 they will admire that. Even the non-wizard wings, they will admire

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 that beautiful, gentle, peaceful attitude.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And that's the story of that ancient time.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Two poor friends. Poor friends, it's a long time.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Those are the former life stories of the Buddha Chacamuni. Always at the very monasteries

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 they have those illustrations. I'm not going to talk about all those things.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 You all know. That is how we, this poor friend becomes so

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 beautiful, so friendly and harmony, peaceful. Not just

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 they become so harmony, peaceful, but all areas become so harmony,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 so peaceful. There are timely seasons,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 raining timely, winters are coming timely, or seasons are coming

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 all timely. The whole climate is really changed in the teachings

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 said. And then in the Tushida Heaven, the gods will see

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 these things, what beautiful things happen in some sort of world.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 So how that happened all that in the many gods, all those are the reasons

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 of these poor friends, so harmonizing, so peaceful. That

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 energy is spreading everywhere. Now everything becomes so

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 perfectly beautiful. Perfectly beautiful. It's just so

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 harmonizing everything, kind of calm, peaceful, gentle. Seasoning

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 everything perfectly. And for example, this time there's so many

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 common nature and disasters. One after another happened because it's also our

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 old kind of emotions, the rolling costs, and

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 thinking of all different things. It also can be reflected to

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 echo the great city of Buddha Shakyamuni and other great masters too.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 So therefore, our love and kindness, compassion, good attitude

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 is also great distribution of contribution to the

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 climate change and the environment level. And that's my

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 reminder, and thank you very much everyone again for participating. And again,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 we see you tomorrow. Now we do the second, our

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 meditation. Thank you everyone.
