00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 "Your beautiful motivation of the bodhichitta, devotion, joy and appreciation for the strong

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 presence of the Bhadavajya Sattva, or fire right in front of you, and we are also each of us, and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.560
 in a state of the Bhadavajya Sattva, visualizing our Sattva people."

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.950
 "Exactly the same as the manner of the three Vedyas always in the teaching set that we heard, and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.780
 that is our practice, not just saying that we have to actualize that. So, Vedyara bodhi, Vedyara p

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.480
ong, Vedyara song, Vedyara mind and space, that is what it is."

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.000
 So, we kind of respect and ignite that qualities with joy, appreciation, courage, commitment, and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.440
 confidence, as well as a very strong bodhichitta. We are doing this practice for all living beings,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.860
 to everyone, to ourselves, to our family, those who are born on our side, those who are alive, and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.640
 to everyone.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.930
 And then also here, one of the Sangha ladies, said to the Vedic family, he asked her to pray for

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 her father. He asked for his name as Rashi Tharpo.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.830
 So, many of you know, but think of all those deceived persons. I mean, this bodhichitta has no

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.240
 boundary, no territory, bodhichitta, true bodhichitta is pervasive, like this.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.620
 So, really, kind of trying to bring up those qualities, in which everyone is pretty familiar.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.440
 Whatever they are going through, troubles, sicknesses, getting old, dead, or having difficulties,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.650
 troubles with birth, or the consenting, all these things, whatever declines, not fulfilling the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:52.080
 wishes, and losing their hopes and goals, whatever they are going through, and for all that wishes,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.720
 in the context of the bodhichitta,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.120
 love, kindness, compassion, joy, and appreciation, non-volence, peaceful manner, in that state,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.320
 really wicked. That is what... So, please, re-stand them.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:13.460
 I mean, I've said it many times, the day before yesterday, and I'm talking today, and then you know

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.870
 all this. It's not something that I'm talking new things that you don't know, so please, re-stand

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.000
 them, that you re-stand them, that I try to re-stand those thoughts,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.480
 and then we do these practices.
