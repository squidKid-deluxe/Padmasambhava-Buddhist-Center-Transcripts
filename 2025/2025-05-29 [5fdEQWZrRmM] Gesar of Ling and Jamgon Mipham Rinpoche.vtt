00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 The emanation of the group Emma Sambaba, and Avalokkuri Shora, Manjushri, and Meja Pani.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:15.040
 All that comes together in one single state as a great warrior, great courageous ones,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.680
 great powerful ones who defeat all negative forces, powerful all the witches.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.740
 That is the Kesa, and the Kesa is very, very special, and particularly also this Kesa is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.400
 very highlighted by the great master Muharambhutya, Jang Muharambhutya, Muharambhutya.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.420
 You all know he is one of the great masters in all the time in the Buddhism.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.080
 He was the emanation of the great Mejushri, as well as the great task letter and the founder

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.600
 of the Anu Yoga teachings in Tibet, known as Sanghi Shri, Nubchi Sanghi Shri, Muharambhutya.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.080
 So he was the, Muharambhutya was the emanation of that.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.520
 And then with Mejushri he comes together as a single state, as a great master Muharambhut

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.620
 who came in the 18th century, around the 18th century he was really so famous, so also humble

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.440
 and simple, hermitage and traveling, going to mountain to mountain, cave to cave, and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.720
 practice meditating and teaching, and then practice so humble and simple.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.840
 And even though become one of the great masters in that time, and as he said all the time,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 but himself as so humble, low-key, he was also a born as a simple person, not recognized

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 as big things and all that things, but later on his great qualities, realizations, and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.600
 knowledge explode and become, then everyone said he's the emanation of this and that things,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.400
 and particularly great master known as Yavin Chinti Wanku, and Jang Wukum Rambud, they all

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.440
 glorified him there, but yet also his state, so simple, humble, nothing really that, more

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.520
 than that, always in the cave, and hermitage that.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.360
 And this is the Kesa, this teaching, Muharambhutya revealed the Kesa teaching, and the Kesa is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.120
 so special, but that particularly Dijan Dijan time, when there's so many kind of like power

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.960
 of the pipe bosons are approaching every direction, kind of dark clothes, and then kind of spoiling

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.600
 all the peace and joy and happiness, and prosperity, will be really kind of destroying that by the,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.240
 kind of all by that.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.680
 And then also that same time, and Gurbimasama predicted, there's raging disturbance by the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.040
 elements, one after the other, and this time maybe we much more kind of news all that things,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 also.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.440
 But I don't know why this is, looks like more, this element, this disturbance is also coming,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.840
 these so many things.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 So this kind of time, it is really the power and work, the power of the Kesa is so special,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.240
 blessed, and also is known as, the Kesa is Buddha, and the Buddha of the courage, Buddha

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.000
 of power, Buddha of abilities, and the prosperity, and defeating all the negative forces, bring

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.160
 the Victoria banner of the positive and the virtues to our heart and mind, and our bodies

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.680
 become like photos of the old blessings.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.400
 Our speech becomes so powerful, truthful, and echoing as thunders in every different

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 direction.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 Our mind becomes so courage and strong as lions, and actigals, and garudas, and that

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160
 all really in the teaching says.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 So practice of the Kesa is so special, and by regularity, this time, when you raise up

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.800
 the lungta, the Victoria banner or the raising of the wind hose energy, and do the Kesa practices,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.280
 that combination, and that condition, the circumstances makes perfect, also to bring

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.480
 up our courage and commitment, confidence in our heart and mind, mind and the kind of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.440
 vitality to our body and all that, really is so special.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.320
 So, this is also teaching of the Moharm which is very special, and so we, again, and this

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.280
 is also one of the very dear practices of our great master, Kinti Pardeshir Rinpoche.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.640
 So, with those, I mean, with those understanding, we do these practices now, and feel strong

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 presence.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.320
 Of course, we join this in the English, so you will know what we joined, and visualize

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.080
 the meditate, meditate, feel the presence.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.280
 When the teaching opens, when you have the, when you have the, with the devotions and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.600
 connections, with all the doubt and hesitations, interference, then whenever you thank the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.000
 Buddhas and the Bodhisattva in light beings, they will be right in front of you.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.960
 They are not just strengthened by the time and the spaces, right there.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.360
 And only why is not happening, lack of our courage and confidence and commitment, that's

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360
 really in the teaching.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.640
 And that time, when Buddhas effort, that's not just the Buddhas do everything, that time,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640
 what are we doing?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:24.000
 We activated our hidden college, our warriorships, our bravery, our courage and commitment, which

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.440
 is commonly known in the Buddha teaching, not commonly, it's very sacred, the Buddha

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 nature.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.200
 Buddha nature, it really will wake up our Buddha nature.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.120
 And then, so, their blessing light as a condition, our potential and the seed of the Buddha nature

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 wake up, and then we become also quite well-equipped, ourself, to move in the jungle of the samsara

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.560
 to can fulfill our good wishes.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.520
 Those are in the teaching making, so have those beautiful motivation toward and combine

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.560
 that with the Bodhisattva and practice is, then in the world, in America, they said win-win

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.680
 situations.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.320
 It will bring all that, so, yeah.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.040
 So now we do practice, again, with a little bit of field presence of the [INAUDIBLE] in

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:23.160
 separable with the [INAUDIBLE] and then our [INAUDIBLE] all combine together right in front

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
 of us as great master [INAUDIBLE] teaching.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.080
 This is also his teaching, he's not just he's written with conception, thinking how to write

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.760
 this and done, and with that, it's just sub-internally arising, really, from his, what's the mind,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.320
 arise as this.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.640
 So this is [INAUDIBLE] and of the great master [INAUDIBLE]
