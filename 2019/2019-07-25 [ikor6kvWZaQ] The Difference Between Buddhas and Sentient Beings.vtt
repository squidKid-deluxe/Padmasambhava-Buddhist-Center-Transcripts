00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 Thank you very much, everyone. Welcome. Thank you. Come and participate. Thank you.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 Again, to continue to follow the teachings of our gracious and completionist teacher,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 the Buddha Shakyamuni, we activate our good motivation,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 and which is joy and appreciation, and both each other, and purity, realization.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.100
 I think many of you already know, amazing, so many times about purity, purity.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.140
 According to the Buddha's teaching, according to the Vedayana teaching,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.080
 everything is enlightened. Everything is really good.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.000
 In even Sattar Mahayana, teaching also said, "Of course, this time, it's not really good."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.940
 We continue to follow the teaching and practice meditation,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 and then gradually, everything will become beautiful.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 Gradually, beautiful. Our minds will become beautiful for gradually getting filled in the field,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.280
 and also, our outlook also becomes filled in the field, so that means what?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 Gradually, our subject will be filled in the field, and our subject will be filled in the field,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.940
 and ultimately, everything is filled in the state, and that time comes as enlightened states,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.070
 and perfect fuel and perfect physical, perfect retinal, perfect hope, that's what we're discussing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.580
 there.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.720
 So that is what the Sattar Mahayana teaching is.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 And the Vedayana teaching is not waiting for a long time to gradually, gradually,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.940
 immediately be activating that, as it is, according to the teaching.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.620
 So for that reason, always in the teaching, there are three major stages.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.840
 That is the Mahayoga teachings. In Anayoga teachings, there are three mandala stages.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.780
 Everything is the three mandala stages.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 In Maha Avin, the Zuki teaching says, "All in three kaya stages."

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.820
 Three kayas are dharmakaya, sambakaya, namakaya.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:18.160
 That means subject is three kaya stages, object is three kaya stages.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.820
 All is in three kaya stages.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:30.120
 Three kaya is then enlightened, as we all know, dharmakaya, sambakaya, namakaya stages.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 So then why we don't see now? Again, same reason, eulogies.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.860
 What is eulogies? Again, that means grasping, or when it is grasping, or clinging.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.990
 Clinging to the subject, clinging to the object. Then there are three things that are called eulog

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.660
ies.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 That is a niche mode. You all know better than me.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:04.180
 But the main is known as zungzi, or idi, with grasping on the subject, grasping on the object.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.760
 Idi means duality, dual clings. That, that.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.260
 So what is that? Actually, it's good.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.160
 Both are drawn to the board, and the job drawn to the board is clinging.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.880
 Where does clinging come from? From ignorance, or unknowing.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 Where does unknowing come from? From the pure nature of the truth, you can't.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.860
 That is known as death. We deluded ourselves.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.060
 That is the starting point of the Inazoki teaching of the samsara.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.780
 Unknowing is the beginning. And that's what, you know, we've been joined, or it's not just like we

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.780
've been joined.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.080
 In the kundasakupri, three moves, kundasakupri, ordinaly is built.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.120
 But, due to the ignorance, then there's tripat, ken.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 One who recognize that ordinal feel as it is, they become enlightened.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.900
 One who recognize, not recognize that ordinal feel, they start roaming to the samsara.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.480
 That's the dividing point, is ignorance.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.680
 Ignorance is also known as subtle ignorance, gross ignorance.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.760
 Subtle ignorance is, is then grasping, subtle grasping to the, when arising energy came from the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.180
 ordinal nature,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:48.420
 the pure energy came, we, kunwalai, instantly did not recognize that is our own display, we panic.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:57.480
 We very still, still panic. I mean, small panic. Small panic, then we escape.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:08.200
 Oh, there's fear. F-E-A-R, fear. Let her fear. There's still, let that panic, panic.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.300
 Panic, and that combination of that, panic is a combination of let her fear, fear, and kind of let

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.360
 her doubt go ahead.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.200
 That is the beginning of the subtle in-bone ignorance. Very subtle.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:31.680
 From that, known as then, the gross ignorance, which is known as exaggeration, ignorance, that

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.980
 which you develop.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:42.380
 From that, ignorance is then crude of ego clinking and negative emotions, all that arises.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:50.740
 Reality is pure. As we discussed yesterday, ground is pure. Foundation is pure. That is dukkim.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:59.140
 States. Pure ground dukkim is purity states. In that level, we, we and the buddha kyakhyamuni on

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.340
 the buddha samantabhara,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.060
 we don't have difference, all the same. For that reason, in the prayer of the kundasamto, what it

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.380
 says,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.520
 "I and all the sentient beings share the same nature." Same nature, we don't have any difference.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:27.000
 For recognizing that nature as it is buddha-hood, not recognizing as it is, begin the delusions of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.340
 samsara.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.600
 That is, what is dukkim teaching or the very un-teaching, we're not going to wait to get that

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040
 purity up and long-term.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.410
 Immediately, we're activating that. Instantly, we're activating that. Therefore, siddhi, everything

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.180
 is purity states, purity states,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.290
 kri kaya states, dharma kaya, and sambho kaya, namakaya states. So, that is just like, I mean, that

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.100
, that's how.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:03.250
 So, we're activating that purity states, prestige. So, yo-ho in appreciation and as well as both

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.020
 each other and that purity states.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:15.120
 Now, again, when we think, of course, it's true, but yo-ho in appreciation, the both each other and

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.380
 the purity states, what is that?

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.920
 That is, everything of the ultimate level, absolute truth, that is duality too.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:33.820
 But this duality, this good beneficial duality is lining up exactly where the nature is.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:41.070
 It's not something that we're distending from the nature. It's lining up to the nature. Therefore,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.540
 it is important.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.290
 Then everything, purity of sathya's dharma kaya, sambho kaya, namakaya, we talk always in the

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.860
 teachings, but it starts to loosen the states.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.250
 Translucent states, as a lamp of bodies. That is what it is, nature is. That is what Buddha Chakry

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.780
amunya, the greatest teacher,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.020
 combustion teacher, taught, and for example, that we guide, always, many of them, we guide, I'm

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.860
 sure many of you know, heart sutta.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:24.390
 What is it in heart sutta? Poem is emptiness. Emptiness is the poem. Poem is no other than the

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.860
 emptiness. Emptiness is no other than the poem.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:37.860
 That is the ultimate nature. And completely kind of pulling down and also lifting up every notion

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.860
 of the grasping and clingings by that.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:50.200
 There is nothing to hold. Grass vine is holding. If there is something to hold, that's perfect. But

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.860
 there is nothing to hold.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:09:00.640
 Hold. And nothing to hold is also consumption. And for that reason, the greatest teacher, what is

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.860
 it, is inconceivable.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:11.750
 The true nature is inconceivable or inexpressible. That is nature. From that nature arises all

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.860
 these displays.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:25.960
 Without any pinpoint source, even scientific physics, I don't say they will know, they will say, it

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.860
 is coming from here, it is coming from there.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:36.270
 All these divisions are kept on the relative levels. All that relative truth in the greatest

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:42.860
 teacher, compassionate teacher, Buddha taught, has interdependent co-organization.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:53.330
 Interdependent, interconnected. All these things happen not just by itself, by one atom producing

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.860
 every norm.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.720
 There is so many trillions and trillions of atoms, molecules or whatever. The particles are

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.860
 combined together.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:11.800
 Gross levels, subtle levels. It is all joint together, like as Jyotsa puddles. All that gross level

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.860
 and coming, all these things and functioning.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:28.350
 Everything. All that. And all that also based on the same nature where it came from. It is great

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.860
 emptiness, great openness.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:42.810
 Everything. Therefore, integration, compassionate teacher say, everything is illusion. Everything

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.860
 is a dream. Everything is a magic.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.800
 It is not just a making of trying to make those kind of puzzles. That is what reality is, relative

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.860
 truth is. That is everything.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:05.440
 And to see this God, for example, this is, of course, this is like, God looks like solid. But to

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:14.910
 become this, this trillions and trillions of the articles or particles combined together came not

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.860
 by one thing.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:26.140
 And then to come here, also there are so many factors behind the same, on the same, all that came

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.860
 here, all that got here. It is not just that, it is everything.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:38.590
 Everything. To come through, every simple thing. For example, how many things do we need to do to

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.860
 break everything? There is this, this, this, this.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:48.940
 At a close level, there are so many subtle things. All that. That is known as in the Buddha's

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.860
 teaching, interdependent coordination.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:58.860
 Co-ordination. For that reason, great master Nārajana said, if it is interdependent coordination,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.860
 it is emptiness.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.860
 If it is emptiness, that is what can interdependent coordination.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:16.030
 That is what is all. Because of emptiness, it is all coming. If there is no emptiness, if there is

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.860
 no openness, it is blocked. It is stopped.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:28.840
 This is about everything. And therefore, our mind is also open-ended. Our awareness or the Rūpa is

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.860
 here. Open-ended. Therefore, there is trillions of the conceptions arising.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:46.560
 Came, and arising, and welcome. And gone too. And they are here. But it is not congestion blocking

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.860
 and all that.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:57.460
 Such total openness, because of the emptiness, awareness or Rūpa Kumbha. That is what really it is

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.860
.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:06.400
 So therefore, this nature is that total openness, flexible state, in a Dharmakaya status. In that

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:14.150
 openness status, that Dharmakaya status, 'I' and 'Kundu Sambo' or 'We' and 'Kundu Sambo' or the 'B

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.860
uddha Shaktamuni' has no difference.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:26.400
 No difference. It is the same. But then, Buddhas, why they are called Buddhas? Because they are

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.860
 recognized.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:37.860
 Nature and we did not recognize. The way things are, they are in nature. Then everything started.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:45.010
 So therefore, this is known as, then, brain beauty, at least lining up toward that direction. We

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.860
 are not going to stay completely dark corner all the time.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:55.310
 We stay in that corner, dark corner, according to the Buddha's teaching, for the biggest time until

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.860
 now.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:06.360
 How long is it? There is even no numbers. Countless time, we stay in that dark corner. We carry the

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.860
 powerful river of the dualities.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:21.860
 Carry that us. That duality is once more created a river, a force of a river. We are not Kundurini.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.860
 We are struggling.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:43.440
 We are completely struggling. We are desperate. Desperate situations because our own creations, our

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.860
 own mistakes, that is what the duality is.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:58.030
 Duality is holding to things, to the gospel. Reality, there is nothing to hold. Mind is sight that

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.860
 salvation does not exist as we think.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:14.420
 Therefore, the greatest teacher, the Buddha said, "Empiness mind." Oni Doki said, "Rupa tumba." "R

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.860
upa means the awareness." "Tumba means the emptiness."

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:24.010
 "Empiness awareness." That emptiness awareness is known as tarmakaya. This is what the greatest

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:29.860
 master, mostly one of the famous masters, Navarajana said, "Again and again."

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:38.860
 "Again and again." He pointed out, as the Buddha told. Clarified that. So strong, so beautiful.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.860
 Known as Mademaka.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:52.860
 Me? No. No holding anything. Free from all extremes. This grasping, clinging is extreme. Holding.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.860
 Then we nominate so many things above that.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.850
 We put the idea in the conception and the beliefs and this and that. It's just piling up all that

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.860
 grasping.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:12.790
 Reality level, there is nothing that you can see and prove. Prove. And what is that? That is known

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.860
 as the inconceivable, inexpressible.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:25.050
 This is not just making up things. That's what we think now. We think now. And so, to break that

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:30.860
 realization is then to bring up that exactly as it is in front or leaning toward that.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:42.850
 Even we have been grasping the duality states over that. It's known as purity. Purity understands.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.860
 So with those told, again, we follow this great instruction from His Holiness.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.860
 His Holiness.
