00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 "To restore all those in several areas, once upon a time is the flourish of Buddhist countries,

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:17.000
 completely destroyed, but to greatly stay continually until 50 years. One forget Buddhism."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.760
 "So he said, 'Hendalagi, he is not going to be invaded by non-Buddhist Buddhist.' But however, he

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.000
 said, 'Abramay Mahaparin Narvanana, there is Buddhism.'

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.770
 'Well, true Buddhism school, whether divided or came, and then it will disturb the structures of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.000
 the Buddhism. Buddhism, the current or what we started.'

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 'What you, Chasondebi, myself, Angar Bhammasubhu, it will disturb.' So then, Chasondebi asked, 'How

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.120
 I do? What I do then?' He said, 'At that time you must invite my student disciple, Kamala Shala, to

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.000
 help these situations.'

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.800
 And then he said, 'If you ask, he won't come. If you don't come, what I do?' He said, 'I will leave

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
 the letter. I will leave the letter.'

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.220
 And then the great master, Chanda, left the letter. He said, 'We need to invite you, and he needed

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.000
 that you must come. If you don't come, you are not my student.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 We don't have the Samayas, but you can echo the very energy. You brought Samayas.'

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.190
 So he really left that strong letters, letters. So then, after Chanda wrote in the past, 'Oh, I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.000
 tell Mahabharata Narayana,' in the debate, they had then difficulties.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.930
 And they called, and this one was a very famous historian. They said they had the difficulties of

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.000
 the Hashing, this Buddhism, from China.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 And it is quite different from what Chanda Ratal and Gurbala Sama told, and what these Hashing

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.000
 masters taught.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.380
 And then, because they are just big in our practice, so Sangha said, 'Divide it, in a way. Split

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.000
 the Sangha, in a way. Split it in having this harmony.'

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So they thought, 'This is the master's time, now to invite the great master, Gama Nakhshala.'

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 So he invited Gama Nakhshala, and he came. And then, they were debated, and it is very famous in

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.330
 the very Buddhist system, that they debated between Gama Nakhshala and Hashing masters, great

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.000
 masters.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.950
 Debated, and then, whoever lost, according to this term, debated, whoever lost the debate, and that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.000
 had to be, leave the areas.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So they met the debate, and Gama Nakhshala warned the debate.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.390
 And then, so, then it is all, then can be reordered, re-located, reordered, to now stay in one

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.000
 system, one system as told by the great master, Chanda Ratal and Gurbala Sama.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 And then, at the conclusion of the Vedic Nagar University teachings, combined together, together

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.000
 and keep the practices there.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.070
 So when the Gama Nakhshala came, and then, so now everything has settled, and it can't be asked, '

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.000
Please, could you ask to Gama Nakhshala? Please, could you write?'

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.760
 The book that tells exactly to start in the Buddhist teaching, contemplate in the Buddhist teaching

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.000
, and meditate on the Buddhist teaching, and about the 'Vuyu', 'Vuyu' or the egolessness.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Could we write the book?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.300
 So, Gama Nakhshala wrote, book, known as instructions on the meditation, the first book he wrote,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.600
 instructions, instructions of 'Vuyu' of the meditation, maybe I should say, 'Vuyu' of the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.000
 meditation, known as Gomuram Tango, first Gomuram books.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.480
 And then Chasondepi read that. Chasondepi is one of the greatest scholars to, of course, his eman

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.000
ation of the Manjushini.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.080
 Manjushini is one of the greatest scholars. He wrote so many books, which is still existing in

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.000
 danger. He wrote many books, Chasondepi himself, greatest scholar.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.700
 So, he read the books, he was so happy, he really liked it so much. Could you write another book,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.000
 tell exactly how to meditate this?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.520
 Not just talking about the 'Vuyu', about important meditations, but how to put it in practice,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.000
 practice the meditation and stop it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.400
 And then Chasondepi wrote second books, second book, known as second book of the meditation, Gomur

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.000
am Tango,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Gomuram Tango, Gomuram Tango, Gomuram Parpa, Parpa.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 He read, told that he read and looked and read, he really liked it so much.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 He said, 'Please, could you write, if you continue meditating in practice, what result will I get?'

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And then, Chasondepi, sorry, Gomuram Tango, third book, called Gomuram Tango, last Gomuram.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.700
 So, in there, then he also explained about the Hachim Mahayana, see, like instruction is not

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.000
 exactly following, it's lined up, the Buddha teaching.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And so, he kind of reported that, to get really achievement of the meditation.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So, Kamalachala is one of the great masters in the debate of Buddhism, really.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Contribute this stone, big, the authenticness of the Buddha teaching of what we have now.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Kamalachala has very much to do with this great master Kamalachala, Shiva.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And so, Kamalachala, in that teaching, the second book of the Kamalachala's teaching,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.160
 said, 'So, there is six cores of good meditation, or six condition of good, cause and condition of

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.000
 the good meditations.'

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That's what great master Kamalachala said in his teachings.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 'Those six are trying to list you and your control.'

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 The first is sitting in perfect places, all comfortable places.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 And the third is supposed to call this place, sitting in perfect places.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 All that means perfect hermitage, perfect hermitage.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Second is less desire, less desire.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And the third is more content, content, content, content.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And the fourth is less engaging activities, port cause.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So, less activity, or not activities, activities.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And fifth is good ethical, or the moralities.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And sixth is less thought.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Those are six good cause and conditions of the meditation, to become good meditations.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 That's it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So, first is hermitage.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Hermitage, we spoke for the day, and you know, hermitage.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Hermitage, this Bhema Samhale, is one of the beautiful hermitages.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And that is great master, again, Magdalene said.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Those I said the other day, I think, 'No.'

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So, I won't maybe repeat that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 And so, that is hermitage, perfect hermitage.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Good place, good support, good area, not obstacles, tickles.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And so, beautiful, excellent, as I said, beautiful water, beautiful earth, beautiful air,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 and beautiful sky for those of key meditations.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And those are hermitage qualities, hermitage qualities.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Then, second is less desire.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Less desire.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 That means not too much kind of obsession with all the like worldly things.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Less desire.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 When you come to the hermitage, then try to stay less desire.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Desire, this needed, that needed, this, that, read the life story of the great masters.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 For example, you learn what meditated three years in the Samhale Mortis.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 He stayed in the caves.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And think of those to compare with us.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 We are just practicing as luxury, as king style, our brand, luxury, what we get.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So, come then, and feel happy, not too many things.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And more content.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Content means more appreciation, more happy, the joy, what we have.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Generally, what the Buddha teaching says, in Hinyan, for example, in Theravadas,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 "Whoever has less desire, more contentment is noble."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 But that's it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Less desire, more contentment is noble.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 That is noble, noble.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So, more contentment.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And then, when we come to the hermitage, less activities,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 at least this and that things, many things, trying to do this.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Less activities, when you are practicing, when you are retrieved.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Less activities, that is.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Then, morality, good morality.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Morality has many, generally in Buddhism, you know,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 opossums, monks, and olden monks, and the very others.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Olden, whatever is basic, kind of keep those.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Whatever you have, come to simplify it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 More gentle, more peaceful, more contentment.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 And generally, those are known as morality.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Morality.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 And then, less thoughts, or not thought.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Thought means, generally, of course, when you are meditating,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 we are stuck, all trying to reduce the thoughts.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 But not recollecting the past memories.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Many tried.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 During the meditation practice, we collected the past memories,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 and particularly related with some emotions.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 It will make our mind so wide.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Less disaster, all kind of provoking our future plans,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 this and that during the meditation.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Again, we are related with emotions.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Emotions, past memories of the past emotions,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 or future plans connected with emotions.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And our meditation, our thought will be agitated,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 agitated, and become very disturbed.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Disturbed.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Then, meditation won't come.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Then, really, we lose ground.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 So, those are the great master Kamalachala pointed out.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And we have those six.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Our meditation causes good, conditions good.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Our meditation will come. Beautiful.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And to do with this, again, to summarize that,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 what many times the teaching says.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Hermitage of body, hermitage of speech,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 hermitage of the mind.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 These three summarize all.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 And hermitage of the body means less physical activities.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 During the meditation, or at least during the meditation.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Hermitage of the speech, not carried by the gossips.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Don't carry by the gossips.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Hermitage of mind, then, as he said,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 not recollecting of the past or the future.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Stay wide.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Wide and peaceful.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 So, that's what in the teaching says.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Pozum.
