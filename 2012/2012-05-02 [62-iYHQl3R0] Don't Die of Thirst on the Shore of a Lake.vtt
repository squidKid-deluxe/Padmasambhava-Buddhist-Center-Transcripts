00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Something more light, more simple, will not become boring and tired and deep-wrested and then can't

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 be composed.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 And if we do this, then what we said here? He had a great master's.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.220
 If we said here, then if we do this, even if you know all those things, if we do important

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.000
 practices,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 then it's same as a person who is so thirsty, so thirsty,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 and died with thirst, right the shore of the big lakes, big lakes,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 right the shore of the big freshwater lakes. He died by thirst. Can you believe that?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 That is the one. If we don't practice, that is the one really going to happen.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 When this happened, what actually happened? We scared our empty teachings in practice,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 didn't put them into the practices, didn't put them into the practices.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 And then we become, almost, we don't know, I'm composed, I'm composed, I don't know what to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 practice,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I have so many practices, I have so many teachings, I read this and that, kind of calm those things

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.000
,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.600
 and then you might try, it looks like you have to close the desert, desert, desert without any help

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.000
.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.490
 Kind of feel that. And then we say for a moment, just call it, just call it, all that comes, one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 after another.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And then, kind of maybe it started, kind of almost like making commentaries on the teachings,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 or the t-shirts, or the sunglasses, and then finally, maybe turn back to one's own self,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 start to make the commentaries, the field disappointment, all that really falls.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And that is what is happening because we didn't organize it, and we didn't put enough inspiration,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 joy in appreciations, joyful effort into the practices.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And that happened, when that happened, many times in the teachings said that four things,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 we kind of completely neglected everything in the four stages.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 What is it? All the studying become intellectual.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 All the studying, the teaching, all that become intellectual.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Intellectual in hovering in the brains. And our kind of, whatever the experience,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 anything what we kind of feel, even close, or this kind of sense, it makes sense or something,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 that we left on the book, we left on the book, or the text, or notes, your notebooks left.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 You feel, oh, that's nice, you write, write down notes, but then it's not in the heart,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 it's on the shelf, in the book, and maybe on the justice of a few different religions, like that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And then what that happened, what happened?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.220
 All this hovering in the brain and kind of intellectual status, you repeat the instructions that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.000
 you received.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Occasionally, we use that in the mouth, verbal.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 The pitta structure is not sinking to the heart.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Heart, we're using as kind of like to something of the advent day, or to show up.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Show up by mouth, speaking, that's speaking.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Practice is not just speaking, pitta structure is not just speaking, making speech.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Pitta structure must sink to the heart and simply from there, grow, dribble up, glowing.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 That is what the beneath practice means.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 If it comes to the mouth, that's what the great Master Bhagavan Mooji said,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 and as the great Master Kinti Bhadishara Mooji said, 'ren boh mouth', 'ren boh mouth'.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 'Zogchin' is not in the heart. 'Zogchin' is on the mouth.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And using that, when you look those, when you say,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 maybe it's something that you're using to show up, to burst your ego,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 or to show up some kind of something of the air, those worldly concernings,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 or something kind of arrogance, using those words, but not really is sinking.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's not the speech of devotion, it's not the speech of that joy, appreciation and bodhicam.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 It's immovable. That is what happens.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 When that happens, when these three things happen one after another,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 what is happening? Our mind has become so ordinary, so habitual, loaded with habit patterns.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And we mix the dharma as un-dharma, dharma.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And that's what the great Master always teaches it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 See, if we don't practice the dharma as dharma, dharma can become as poisonous.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It hurts us. It hurts you, it hurts others.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 And our mind becomes so ordinary.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Maybe more ordinary than the person who is in the street or in the business place.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So what is now benefiting our practice?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 That means our dharma and our practice, our song, went to different directions.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Even though at the beginning of the time we started something nice,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 something good intention, good intention, but because we must handle it,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 and then it went to different directions.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Then we become emotionally kind of like,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 instead of practicing, we become emotionally kind of like critics.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Critics, right? Yeah, critics. We become critics.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Critics, artists and kind of watchers.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Watchers and what is happening, you're falling in a ditch.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 You're falling in a ditch. Dharma is not going in the right directions.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 If dharma goes in the right direction, what are the teachings said?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Here in the books and everywhere.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Your love, joy, devotion, bodhicata.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 All are just coming out at sunshine, warm, so tender, so gentle, so peaceful.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Your activity of the body, your verbal speech of the speech and your mind,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 so blending in essence, so peaceful, so gentle, so respectful,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 appreciationist, and so humble.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 That is known as the practicing is going right direction.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Practicing is not just right direction. You become dharma.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Dharma, you're not separated. That is the one practicing is.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Therefore, for those reasons, these great masters say, say, say, say,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 is, is, therefore, if we don't really practices, then what happens?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Happening, even you know all the teachings of the Buddhas.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Buddhas, when we leave this world, we just become,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 we left this world with the only, as very only, very only.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Even if you died, I'm as used here. You already have these books.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 You already have the commentary sections.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 You died in the bed,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 died in the bed, the scholar, you died in the scholar body.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Scholar body died in the bed with the scholar head.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Head of the scholar and died as the only person in the bed.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 If that happened, then really nothing is really too much benefited.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Of course, in the teaching said, when you practice or when you start dharma,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 it will sing to the heart. It will skip in the alaya,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 so how can the straw out status?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Sooner or later, it will benefit one day, but not really that moment.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 We died as great scholar name, name, but nothing more than that, only the name.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And therefore, these great masters, the Paramahansa, you say, watch out.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 We should try to avoid that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 We should try to avoid dying with the thirsty, thirsty at the great, very fresh land, fresh land.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And we should try to watch out.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Watch out as knowing all the teachings, but not practiced and died, very kind of like all new ways.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 We should, shouldn't we, shouldn't we?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And therefore,
