 "Wiking Breathe is a very, very special meditation. Definitely it is a very special meditation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.140
 It is one of the great techniques that will bring the mind more stabilizing, more stiff,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.000
 concentrated.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.880
 So therefore, the Wiking Breathe is a very special meditation. Definitely we should do that for a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.000
 while.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.140
 Even for one period of the meditation, for example, let's say you are doing meditation for one hour

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.000
, practice for one hour,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I would say really those I do for maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes, like that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.510
 After that, when the mind is a little more stabilized, then maybe you don't have to follow the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 breathing.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 Because the purpose of that is to stabilize the mind more concentrated, more systematic, putting

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 them.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 So once your mind is a little more stabilized, then you can relax.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Because when you're Wiking Breathe, there is still some effort.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 So effort, there is some degree of concentration that involves effort.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 So then, I want to use this level stabilized mind, then maybe, then relax the mind.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.980
 We don't have any effort to relax in the present state, present state, and the past, future,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.000
 present.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Even in the Dokki teachings, it goes beyond the present state.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 So this three times is the consultant state.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 And this going beyond the present state is the fault state, fault time state, which is the natural

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 state of our self, everything.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 So relaxing that natural state.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 To do this, then we don't make any effort.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Just be in the present state, keep normal breathing, and then relax.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And that status, and the thought will come.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Thought will come, that means don't try to prevent it or stop it from thought.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 For that reason, let it come.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And also, when thought comes, we're not going to analyze the thought and hold that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 That we analyze, we're not letting go.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 So we're not going to analyze, let it go.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.390
 As wind blows in the sky, let it come, wind in the space, let it be in the space, let it go in the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.000
 space,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 and the wind never affected sky quality at all.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 And similarly, if we keep that system, in the teachings said, it will never affect our nature of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 the mind,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 or nature is looking, just only displays.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Mind comes, mind stays, mind goes.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And the nature of the mind, that coming towards consumption, is also empty.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 There's no substantial solid existence.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And so when you look to the past memories, there's nothing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 When you think of the future, there's nothing.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 When you talk to the spirit of thought, if you think of this, there's nothing that we can hold.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 It's all empty, it's displayed.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 So to kind of behold and to bring that realization, then in the Dzogji teachings said,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 let it come, let it be, let it go.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Relax in that, but don't distract it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 This is the one to teach it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 If we distract it from that, then it becomes the conceptions.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 So therefore, keep being aware, aware of that, with that aware, awareness, aware,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 and then let it come, let it be, let it go.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Then that is the according, I mean not according, in the Dzogji teaching,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 or in Mahayana teaching to you, Mahadeva teaching.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 That is the principle practice.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 That is then, when you be in that status, then did that become as natural?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 What is it?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 There is an insect behind the blind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Okay, I can't really remind the porcupine.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Porcupine is either here or somewhere.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 So are you able to remain, I mean it's like that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Then really apply this, as we say, inconceivable, inexpressible,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 unborn, unceasing by nature, the sky.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That is the essence, that is the heart of the Buddha and the heart of the political.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Thank you.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Thank you.
