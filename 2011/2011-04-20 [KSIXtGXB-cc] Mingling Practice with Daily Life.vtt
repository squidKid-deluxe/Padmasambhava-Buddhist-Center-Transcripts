00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240
 Many times, our Dharma and ourself go in a separate direction. We started together as one, mingled

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 that, but then as we go in a path, as time goes, Dharma becomes kind of like Sai, and ourself

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.000
 becomes a completely different Sai.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.240
 When that happened, then we are not going well, as we wished, as we started. And then, it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.330
 completely separate. Therefore, connecting Dharma to our heart center, and ourself becomes as

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.000
 Dharma.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.020
 And mingling Dharma is really so important with our mind streams, mind streams and ourself, and so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 that ourself becomes like Dharma, Dharma, that's what we like to be.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.840
 What is Dharma, as you all know? I said so many times, and can't hear why they hear it, and we said

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.000
 so many times.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.250
 So, Dharma is nothing but goodness of ourself. It's love, it's kindness, it's compassion, it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 understanding, thoughtful, as we discussed yesterday, thoughtful, mindfulness.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.800
 All those beautiful ingredients, that is Dharma. Make something of ourself happy, joy, peace, and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.080
 share that to the others. Have that attitude, have that ourself. Fill ourself out and in, and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.000
 between, everywhere in that state.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 Then, ourself is a mongol with Dharma. That is what it is. And so therefore, this is so important.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.000
 Start with that beautiful attitude, and then we practice. We practice and say, "Yes, what?"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.450
 Practice is, start with that beautiful attitude, then deepening that practice is the practice. Drip

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.000
ening, more deepening, restatening, and glorifying, that is really practice.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.890
 And this is, then we have, in the Vedayana practice, we have true. In the Gyanarana speaking, is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.000
 the virtualization and the completion state practices.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 The virtualization is the meditative aspect of ourself. Instantly, bring our hidden qualities,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.220
 nature, Buddha-nature, bring up completely in the state as what we are, and then see the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.000
 environment, everything in that state.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.120
 And that is, essence is, again, always in the Vedayana teaching said, the blessfulness of the great

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 emptiness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.230
 Vedayana practice, Buddha-nature is blessfulness. Buddha-nature is open and relaxed. Bring that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.000
 instantly to our state, and then visualize according instructions, teaching.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.100
 That is the virtualization practices. And that is meditation truth. We have completely connected

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
 our mind with that virtualization, with that meditation.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.120
 That is meditation. We are relaxed, resting, and staying in that state, not disturbed by all the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 mundane habitual patterns.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 And that is the most powerful, skillful means practices that immediately we lift up from the dual

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.000
ity world to the organ and nature of our states.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.510
 And that is known as the Vedayana skillful means practices. So that is the virtualization breathing

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.000
.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.240
 And then, complete state practices, is then known as completion state practices, dissolve, I think

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.000
 the next one, as we call it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 But what is dissolved is duality. Duality, structure, holding, anything that is dissolved.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.120
 Where it is dissolved? It is dissolved in this case. Generally, everything is in the great

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.000
 emptiness states, the transparent, lucid state.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 But in our case, or the two kind of like, to explore the root of the nature, go with the root.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.430
 And that is the mind. So, all is dissolved into the mind. Mind started and dissolved back to the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.000
 mind.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.840
 And relaxing that state without any consumption, without any duality. And that is known as Zocchi

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.000
 meditation.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.090
 Completion state is Zocchi meditation. Relaxing that status, in that original status, free from the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.000
 duality, free from the structure, free from any thought.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 And relax and move forward with that. Relax, open, not holding, as is the arising different thought

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000
 and different energies in the mind.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 We will let that go. Continually stay in the course. Course is natural and instant moment.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.380
 We stay continually in the course. Whatever the sidetrack came from the display of the mind, we are

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.000
 not going to hold with the sidetrack.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.830
 Track or the energy, we stay in the center. And our cruise, cruise level. Cruise level, course, and

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.000
 continually move that open state.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 With joy, with relax, with nature, with happy, and continually. And peaceful, and natural.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And as great master his holy said, and in Zocchi teaching, he said, "Relax every senses.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.570
 We are not going to regulate the senses and try to do something manipulating with joy. Do this and

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.000
 do that, or analyze that. We are going to relax."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And all those are sidetracks. Sidetracks when we are talking about the course of the nature.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.110
 It's a beauty, relax, and that's it. With this understanding, and then that practice is continually

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.000
 to the external.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 External, that is known as post-mediatric, external world, particularly this post-mediatric.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Post-mediatric we need to come. Then we discussed many times about samayas, vavas.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.640
 Those all are trips, all are instruction as I said so many times, and you've heard that so many

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.000
 times from great masters.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Such as like Kintin, Roach, and Zocchi. You've heard that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 This is like all this. It's all tips. It's all instructions.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It is also tips of the way we are going this journey.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 What kind of the science and the regulations of science will come up?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.760
 And what kind of like how we can move forward without distracted by those signs, signs, and labels

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.000
 on the road.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.450
 We're not going to disrupt that with signs and labels. We're going to check that as tips of the way

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.000
 we are driving.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 We're going to use that as you all know.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 These signs and regulations, speed in hours, all those, they didn't sidetrack us.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 They didn't. They used that to smooth our light, safe drive, nice drive.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.240
 Similarly, these samayas, guidelines and all that, when we take this journey, there's all those

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.000
 welcome.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Definitely welcome. We're not going to sidetrack, and distracted by the sidetracks.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Take those as precautions. Take those as expert instructions.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Take those as advice.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Take those as fit instructions of the experiences, hearing their journey to us, where they went.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.830
 And so that we can be as them and follow the footsteps, and then we reach to our destination with

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.000
 these signs.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 This journey is not outside, right? That you all know.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 We're not taking journey outside. We're talking journey inwardly.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Discovering, exploring our beauty, our nature of the Buddha nature, that's what the Buddha taught.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 From all the teachings, that is what we are discovering and exploring.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Exploring so that we become as Buddha, or we become the Buddha.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And becoming Buddha is not just also strange, or it is kind of alien that we're going to become.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 We become true to what we are.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Presenting what we are is in one way, alien, ourself.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 We're carried with the force of the duality.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 We're hovering on the outskirts of the natural beauty.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 We're just completely distracted with somewhere in the corner,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 where we're not really experiencing and discovering richness of the Buddha, Buddha nature.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 But practicing means we are exploring that,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 and we're going to see whole panoramic world of the true nature's beauty as it is, as they.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 That is the practice. Look at this Buddha chapter many.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 We read the life story of the Buddha chapter many.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 How he is drawn to the Earth.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 How he is simple, or how he was simple.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 How he is so normal, so thoughtful, so gentle, so peaceful, so accepting.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.840
 And then all those great masters, one after another, those great masters, they are great

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.000
 practitioners.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 They're not just become as great master came with that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Because of that joy and devotion, courage and commitment, they become what we call great masters.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.990
 And when we see as great master them, how they are really drawn to the Earth, and how they are too

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.000
 simple.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And how so? So just look at it.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 This is what the Buddha. When we become Buddha or something, it's nothing changed.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 We become the true beings, the nice, decent guys and girls.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Girls and girls, boys and girls. We become nice pokes.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Nice, really good pokes. Nice pokes.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 That's what really when we become the Buddha, it's not something that alien or something distant.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And this is what really the practice is.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So when we move with this, then I'm not going to now talk too many, all these things.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 We go move to the here, to the here.
