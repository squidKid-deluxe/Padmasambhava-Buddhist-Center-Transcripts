NOTE     "synopsis": "Medicine Buddha Empowerment and Teachings by Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nDecember 8 and 9, 2018\nPalm Beach Dharma Center\n\nAll the teachings of the Buddha aim to reveal everyone\u2019s inherent goodness nature and dynamic health. According to the Buddha, everyone\u2019s essential nature is naturally peaceful, intelligent, loving and free. However, in different degrees, we do not recognize the truth and treasure of our situation and therefore experience many different kinds of temporary challenges and limitations. The Medicine Buddha is renowned as a living reflection of wisdom, compassion and healing, who soothes and frees ourselves and others from imbalance by reconnecting us to our true essence. This practice is extremely concise and potent, radiating multitudes of blessings for the benefit of all beings.\n\nWe hope you can join us for this very special occasion when Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give empowerment, transmission, and pith instructions of the Medicine Buddha according to the great master and co-founder of Tibetan Buddhism, Shantarakshita, as revealed by the great Nyingma and Kagyu master Raga Asye.\n\nAs a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice from the basic teachings of mindfulness to the most advanced meditation techniques of Dzogchen, Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche has lived and been a friend of the Palm Beach community for over 30 years. He has an amazing ability to communicate profound topics in simple words, touching people\u2019s hearts and opening their minds to their innate potential of wisdom and compassion. He is the author of many learned works in Tibetan, and has co-authored over 30 Dharma books in English with his brother Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche travels extensively within the U.S.A. and throughout the world, giving empowerments, teachings, and guiding students with personal advice.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPalm Beach Dharma Center\n1205 North Federal Highway\nLake Worth, Florida 33460\n\n(561) 547-4711\ninfo@pbdc.net\nwww.pbdc.net\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Thank you very much everyone. And as you all know, this morning I'm going to offer the Empowerment

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.000
 of the Medicine Buddha.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.510
 Before I offer the Empowerment as part of the ceremony, I'm going to bring the introduction, which

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.000
 is part of the ceremony.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.410
 Even though many of you already know this, but again it's part of the, again as you say, lineage

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.000
 instruction is a remembering of how all this teaching happened.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And everything teaching what we offer here or again is the teaching of the lineage.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.560
 This lineage is started from the greatest, kindest, complicated teacher from the Buddha Shaptamuni,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.000
 who came 2,600 years ago in India.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 This lineage is continued until now as unbroken lineage.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.860
 Often in the teaching you say "stainless teaching" as natural or "stainless natural, golden natural

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 teaching" that continually, until now, is uninterrupted, diluted, and continually carried on that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.450
 And preserved that integrity of the devotion, courage, and commitment, and loyalty kept that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.000
 teaching from the time Buddha shared this teaching until now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 So that is what today we are connected to that again, to that teaching.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Again, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shaptamuni, who came as I already said to you and you know him,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 2,600 years ago he came.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And he become the Buddha at age 35.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Until, from the age of 35, until the age of 81, he continually gave the teachings.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.880
 And that teaching he relied on to understand what was done or the realization he achieved that he

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.000
 shared that with others.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 He relied on the nature of the mind, one's own nature of the mind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 And he saw the nature of the mind is full of the beautiful qualities, love and kindness, compassion

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.000
, courage, commitment, and confidence, and that richness that he revealed.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 When we discover that nature, that our own beauty nature, what we have, then we completely become

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.000
 as fearlessness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 We become the indestructibles.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 We move on this world or in this samsara of the world without fear and difficulties.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Because in the present time, we don't have that realization or understanding.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 That's why many times we are struggling, struggling all the time.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.700
 But once we explore our beauty in the nature, then you become, each of us become as completely,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.000
 totally happy, peaceful, free from all the obstacles and fears, disease, sicknesses.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 That's what the daily teaching says. That's what the Buddha discovered.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.120
 This teaching of the Buddha is totally love and kindness, compassion, and wisdom combined together,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.000
 thinking of every living being.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 Every living being has also that potential, that richness. It's not just only the selected group

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.000
 has that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Everyone shares the same nature. As we, everyone shares the same element, fire, water, wind, space.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.400
 There's no distinction between somebody shares, somebody don't have to have the element, or the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.000
 space, or the ears.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.700
 Everyone needs A. Everyone needs the space. Everyone needs these elements, same where the nature

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.000
 and the beauty is the same.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 There's no difference. That is what really the gracious teacher Buddha told.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And he gave the teaching that, as I said, started from the age 35 under age 81.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 And those old teachings are, can summarize in the teachings known as the Nainyana teachings,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.000
 teachings that summarize them.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.620
 And all that teaching came to Tibet in eight centuries. At the time of the great, known as the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.000
 Great King, Darmapetra, known as Kintasong Devti,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.410
 through his courage and commitment is his dedication to bring this authentic and beautiful richness

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.000
 teaching as a gift to the Tibetan peoples.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.590
 Really, he made such a big effort. And because of that, his courage and commitment, he was able to

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.000
 invite the great master teacher,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 known as the Burb A Masambhala, and a great teacher known as Shanta Rakhta, Ache Shanta Rakhta.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 The both, the both are invited to Tibet.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 These three individuals come together and brought the entire teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.020
 That whole, his teaching, there are 45 years teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni brought to Tibet

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.000
 completely.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.610
 Everything brought to Tibet. Those teachings are continually preserved by all those dedicated

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.000
 practitioners.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Practitioners. And essentially, until now, everything really is preserved.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 They practice. How they preserve it? They practice. They made it.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 They not just let the intellectual status, they receive the teaching. They practice.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.650
 They made it full of devotion, courage, and commitment, and compassion, and loving-kindness,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.000
 respect, and appreciation to every living being.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.110
 And both the beauty of non-violence, peace, they completely, individually become totally a symbol

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.000
 of the peace.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Peace, and love, and compassion, and humble, and humility.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 At the same time, they share that knowledge with others.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And continually preserve that teachings.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 So these teachings are done in Tibet.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Of course, most of the old Vedans are Buddhism.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.280
 Even in the Tibetan, there are a few different sub-schools of the Buddhists, known as the Nirma

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.000
 schools, Gaju, Satya, Ghelova schools.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Particularly, this teaching, what came today, is come from the Nirma schools of the Buddhism.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.170
 Particularly, this great teacher, the master, Shanda Rakchada, who was one of the co-founder of the

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.000
 Tibetan Buddhists,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 he was a very famous practitioner of the Meris Buddhas.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 He really highlighted the Meris Buddha practices in Tibet, very much.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 He himself practiced it. He shared that teaching to the others, and came to some Vedans.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 So the Meris Buddha becomes a very popular practice to all the schools of the Vedic Buddhists,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 and particularly the Nirma schools of the Vedic Buddhists.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 The Nirma schools of the teachings are then continually carried by two Tamil lineage systems.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Those are known as the Kama and the Thelma. Those are both the Ayurvedic languages.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 But Kama means oral transmission teachings.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 From the teacher to the student, from teacher to the student, continually carried on that.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Again, he kept that, as I said, with devotion, with courage, with commitment, with loyalty.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 He kept the authenticity of that teaching. They never deluded that teaching.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 With the consumption of thought, 80, this and that, they really kept evaluating things represented

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 at the time and continually now.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And that is known as the Kama teaching. Kama means oral, oral transmission-mitted teachings.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 And then the second technique is known as the Thelma teaching.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Thelma teaching is known as then, the heathen.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And that is by the great Martin Gaurupa Masambhava, Muslim Rakhini Ishin.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.590
 So the female lady, very highly realizing the beings, again, she reached the enlightenment within

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.000
 that lifetime,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 in the disciple of the Maasambhava.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And they both are hidden, these many teachings.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And then as well as other many great Masambhas too, hidden and rediscovered that teaching.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 And that is known as thelma teachings.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.040
 And that is the particular, this Kama and Thelma teachings are very specifically linear systems of

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.000
 the Numa schools of the Vedic Buddhism.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.980
 Numa is the one of the, what is to be, that again is to be the word which means ancient schools of

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.000
 the Vedic Buddhism.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 It started from, at the time, very much time or the 8th century until now.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 So that is the teaching continually now that the Numa.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So this particular today teaching, what I'm offering you is the combination of the Kama and Thelma.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Thelma and Thelma joined together that both linear teaching.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And again, very famous who did this, very famous teaching, teacher known as Raga Aksi.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Raga Aksi or the cat of Karma Chami.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 He was one of the very famous great masters in only, in the 17th century I think, around that time.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And he was also master of all the Buddhism.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And particularly he was very famous master of the Numa and the Khaji schools of the Vedic Buddhism.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And it is Raga Aksi.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And he himself as great practitioners of the Meris of Buddhas.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And he was also great writer, great beginner, and great scholars, and great practitioners.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 He practiced also hermitage. He really practiced so long and retreat all the time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 I mean, his whole life in a way.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Practicing, meditating, and retreat in a cabin.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And also he was a fully ordained monk.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And also very humble, very respectful for everyone, to everyone.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 And he was one of the very famous great masters.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 His teachings are all very simple, easy to understand in the Tibetan kind of colloquial levels.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And so simple, but yet so profound, so direct, he really touched the heart.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Heart of the individual practitioners.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And so kind of simple, it just reigns in the heart.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 So beautifully important.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 So these great masters combined these two lineage teachings together.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And he has varieties of the Meris of Buddhas teachings.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 But today, while offering is one of the very conversant teachings,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 of course, we go to more details in this open of that.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 So that is what this Meris of Buddhas teaching continues.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And now we talk really about the Meris of Buddhas.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Meris of Buddhas is the Buddha of the healings.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 This Buddha, generally in Buddhism, there is many, many Buddhas.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Why? Because according to Buddhism,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 the Buddhas taught that every living being has the same potential,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 same nature as Buddha Shapta Muni himself.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 There is no difference between man and woman or any poems.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Regardless any poem you have, the nature is the same.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Potential is the same.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 If you walk for your potential, your nature,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 you have the 100% right to become or discover that beauty and that nature.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 So therefore, there is so many Buddhas who discovered fully that nature.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 What is that nature?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 That nature is loving kindness.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 That nature is compassion.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 That nature is openness, not solid object.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Not just concrete or solid, openness.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Another name in the Buddha's teaching named emptiness.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 It's the empty of the solid, empty of the grasping, empty of the cleanings,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 empty of the poem, poem.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 That mystery, that beauty, that openness is combined with compassion,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 loving kindness, wisdom, understanding.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 That is what nature is.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 In order to discover that nature, you have to do that same thing.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 You have to explore more compassion, more loving kindness, more mindfulness, combined together.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Then when we start with that, when it comes immediately, it brings more joy to individually.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 This is not pretty tale of stories telling someone.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 If you start touching to your own nature of love, kindness and compassion,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 and mindfulness or the wisdom, what it brings?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 It brings joy.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 It brings peace.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 It brings calmness.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 It brings openness.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 It brings realization, the beauty of one's own self,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 really about others, not located in the kind of corner of the darkness

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 and not seeing anything and only kind of with hope and affairs, kind of continually challenging.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 You really become totally warriors of the love and compassion and kindness and the wisdom.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 That is what nature is and we have to do.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 So therefore, whoever does that, if they follow that,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 they have 100% right to become Buddha or another world

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 who becomes fully discovered, you are in it in nature.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Whatever we named, Buddha, enlightened beings, or whatever we named, everyone.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 So therefore, there are so many Buddhas.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 There are many Buddhas, there are women Buddhas.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 There is peace of Buddha and also there are very powerful, peaceful Buddhas.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 In order to defeat the ego-clinging, in order to defeat the neurotic mind,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 in order to defeat the self-important, self-centered minds.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Therefore, there are also many of those enlightened beings or Buddhas,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 who are prepared to benefit and help other beings,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 guide and discover their beauty and their nature.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So therefore, there are many Buddhas.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 According to Buddha Shaktamuni, these Buddhas are in every different direction.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 This is what we call the world, but this is not just, according to Buddhism,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Buddha Shaktamuni is teaching, this is not just only this world, this single world.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 There are so many universes, so many worlds, every direction,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 up and down and every direction of this where we are.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 So where is the Buddha? Is he leaving the Buddha right now?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 It's not asking the Buddha who came and gone and become like historians,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 or he's going to come in the future.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 He is right now leaving the Buddha.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 According to Buddha Shaktamuni, according to all those great practices,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 the Masters, he's leaving the Buddha, where is he now?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 In the east direction of this universe, our world, is the direction.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Not just only in the close of our neighborhood like the world,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 according to Buddha Shaktamuni, many, many universes pass to this direction.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 One after another universe, one after another universe,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 many universes pass beyond the pure land of the very Buddha,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 the Buddha who is right now leaving the Buddha.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 The Buddha is a total enlightenment.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 His wisdom has no territories, no divisions between time and space.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 His love and compassion has no time and space.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It's beyond time and space, every direction.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 He is right, leaving the Buddha now.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 That was also Buddha Shaktamuni when he was in India.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 He was usually traveling with bare feet,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 manipulating with his students.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 One time he came in the city of the known as Vishalis.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 When we came to the Vishalis and the time and the situation,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 the circumstances and gathering, everything is so perfectly beautiful

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 to explore the teachings of the Protestant Buddha.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 That moment, through the power of the Buddha Shaktamuni,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 he immediately opened the door of these directions.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 All the audience, everyone who was there,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 began to see the Protestant Buddha.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 The Protestant Buddha is so.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 He showed that, he kind of ushered and opened the door of that.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 This is the Protestant Buddha.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 The Protestant Buddha of your land is the complete healings

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 because the fundamental cause of the sicknesses and difficulties

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 is our own negative emotions.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Our negative emotions are ignorance, attachment, or grasping, and anger.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Anger is connected with fears.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 How many fears?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 That tendency, that negative emotion is the fundamental cause of sicknesses.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And pure natural medicine Buddha is totally free of that.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Free of ignorance.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Free of the grasping or the attachments.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Free of the angers.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Therefore, there is no sicknesses.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And everything is healing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Everything is healing qualities, healing powers, wisdom,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 shimmering light, that they really see that.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 And at the time, Buddha Shaktamuni gave the teachings on the Marys of Buddhas.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Marys of Buddhas.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 There is a quote, "Suktara of the Marys of Buddhas."

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I bought that text.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 It's more than in shine.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I will give you as a blessing to you later.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Later.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 I have that text.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I'm here.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 It's a part of the teaching.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 That is the Marys of Buddhas teaching.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 The Buddha gave that.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 So as the Buddha gave that teaching, that time,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 then this teaching of the Marys of Buddhas is continued now.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Until now.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Completely.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Everyone begins to practice on this.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 In Tibet.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Really, there are no different schools of Buddhism.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 It has differences.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Everyone practices meditating on this.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 This is the Marys of Buddhas practicing.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 It's not just the Marys of Buddhas practicing.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 It's only where we are sick or the healings.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 This is practice for this life.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Next slide.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 In the Bardo and all the time.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Every time.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 This is so special practice.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 For the healing.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 For the longevity.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 For the increased lives.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 For our varieties.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 For our performance.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 For our all the, like, any relationships.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Our successful.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Really, Marys of Buddhas is one of the great practices, teachings.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And therefore, this becomes one of the very powerful

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 and very influential practices in the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 And a particular human.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Since this is so special.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Therefore, in Gharipya Masambha, also give a lot of these teachings.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Teachings.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 And there is also many Therma teachings of the Marys of Buddhas.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So many Therma teachings.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Hidden, rediscovered by many great masters.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 One after another.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Another.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 So that is what the, what this Marys of Buddhas is.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 And today, then I'm going to give you this as empowerment.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 This, or the blessings of empowerment.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Again, the empowerment.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Now, so that is really about the Marys of Buddhas.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And now about the empowerment.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 I mean, of course, most of you all know this empowerment.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 But what means empowerment?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Empowerment means it's breaking our potentials.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Our Buddha natures.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 The Buddha nature of the Marys of Buddhas.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Such Buddha sattamis.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Love and kindness and compassion and wisdom.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 That, we have that potential as I said, repeated many times.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And you all know, according to Buddhist philosophy and teaching, always said that.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 We all have that belief in nature.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 There is no difference in that.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 But this time, our that beautiful nature is like in a way, sleeping mood.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It's kind of sleeping.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 It's not completely alert status.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 So the empowerment, it will help to activate, to bring alert status.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 At times, or at least, sometimes.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Once we got alerted and brought up that alert status,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 then we continue to carry on that, then it will bring very beautiful result.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Even though we didn't do that, but once we received, because it's touch to our nature.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 What we have the nature, what do you receive that?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 It's connected together.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 It's not just going to react to each other.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 It is merged.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 It's mingled together.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Your nature is, as I said, many times.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 It's love, compassion, kindness.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Teaching is what you receive the empowerment.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 It's love and kindness, compassion, wisdom.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So it's completely blended in.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Blending, there's no reactions or counter reactions.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 There's no counter reactions.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 It's just blended in.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 And therefore, it will activate it in the teaching sense,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 even though it didn't do anything now, a short time.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 But it will help to activate it in the future, because it is blended in there.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 And that is really the meaning of the empowerment.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And in one way to say that.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 There's some other way to explain those things.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 And now, and how you receive this empowerment through meditation,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 through linear blessings, through the richer audience,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 and through the mantras.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Those way, you receive this empowerment.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 So that is my brief kind of introductions of this part of the teaching,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 or part of this empowerment.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And now, we do the empowerment itself.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 The empowerment itself, again, is going to be divided into three seconds.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Beginning, and middle, and concollating.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Concollating, and so beginning, and middle, and concollating.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 So we begin.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So now, in order to do the empowerment,
