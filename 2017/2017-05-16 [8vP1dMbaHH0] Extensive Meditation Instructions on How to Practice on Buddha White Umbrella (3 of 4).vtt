00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800
 "Be by the body and the tiri by the speech. Gopa is laughing, very happy, very joyous, joyous

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.980
 status. Very laughing. And Shiva.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 Shiva means revealing the arrows of the others. Wearing that speech that reveals instantly the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.980
 mysteries and witness of the egos. And egos, like all the activities, reveal immediately.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.730
 And then Shiva, sorry, what's called structure? Structure is not just also when they reveal that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:49.210
 arrows and mistakes, not just short, short ways, but very powerful way, very, really, very strong,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.800
 very, very, in a way, loudly, loudly, clearly, without any kind of like, that we are not going to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.960
 say, 'I am unheard.' We are not going to say unheard.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.620
 That, just so strong, so powerful, so accurate, those are the, by the speech, speech, the principle

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.960
 qualities of speech. And then, yin gi, namba, kyo a, this mind.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.220
 Now, even though those external looks like so stressful, so powerful, so dramatic, so kind of

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.110
 frantic, but the heart or the yin gi means compassion. It's completely compassion, compassion

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.960
 status, kindness and compassion.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:46.030
 And then, namba means that is also very deep. Namba means deep, very deep compassion and wisdom and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 compassion, so deep, deep. And then here is peaceful, total peaceful status, calm and peaceful,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 relaxed, that is what it is. That is free by the mind.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:13.300
 And this is what applies here. For example, here, here, there are two hundred facing, right eye,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 yellow, frightening and laughing wide. And two hundred facing behind are the splendid and the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.960
 shutting tongue.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.890
 Those are the different oscillator and the mighty broken oscillator. Two hundred facing left are

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.960
 the green and peaceful, expressing the compassion.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.400
 Two hundred facing outward are the blue, outward and outward. So those are the expressions of have,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.960
 body, speech and amongst the mind qualities.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.980
 And then, along with this, also known as, she is immediately she is performing four activities of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.960
 the buddhas, all five different activities of the buddhas.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:04.130
 Those are known as the pacifying activity and increasing activity, magnetizing activity and subjug

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.960
ating activities.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.460
 And then, all simultaneously performing activity, those are known as five activities that she is

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.960
 performing immediately that, that is symbolized by these five different goggles are facing.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.100
 And then, similarly, also it is symbolized by the Vasudas as well as two. And then, these three,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.960
 each face has three eyes and those are symbolized the three Vasudas.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:41.620
 Three Vasudas, or that she is passed in prison, clearly everything, things, all that Vasudas knows,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:51.260
 perfectly called, the nature of the cause, perfectly knows, or that Vasudas knows perfectly the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.960
 nature of the result.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.550
 And then, Vasudas knows it perfectly, called the nature of the both cause and conditions. Those are

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.960
 in the Buddha teaching also known, named as three dolls of liberation.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.790
 And which is the like cause, result, and the characteristics of the both cause and result, result

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:23.910
 or purpose, that. And so, those eyes are rolling, rolling, and eyes are moving with the sparking of

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.960
 the western light and the fires.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:38.410
 And then, he has two left, two, sorry, ten, ten, one thousand arms, or the hands, and all holding

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:46.960
 those, the soles, as you say, and again ten, one thousand feet.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.910
 And then, he is also crushing and subduing all the like, negativities, obstacles, and obscurations.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.700
 And then, also these two obstacles, the biggest two obscurations in the teaching are often known as

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.960
 the two eagles.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.220
 These two eagles are known as the individual eagles and the phenomenal eagles. Those are all in

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.960
 another way grasping to the individual, grasping to the all phenomenal existence.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:25.800
 These two grasping are the most powerful obstacles. And she is crushing both, that symbolizes this,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.960
 both, both completely.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:38.220
 So, this 500 extender right legs, crushing all the fears, fears, that is then symbolizing all the,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.960
 what's called, these, the phenomenal eagle clangies.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.640
 And 500 legs are bent inward, crushing all obstacles, and that is then an individually eagle clang

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.960
ie, related with that, all obstacles.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.320
 Then she is the embodiment of all the Buddhas, all the Buddhas, three times, vast, present, future,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.960
 or ten directions.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:14.110
 To symbolize that, the seven, seven million Buddhas are counted on her paper on chakras, or her

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.960
 head, seven million Buddhas.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.630
 Adun, Maikron, or the white umbrella kron, which is Maaj, and the seven levels of the white canop

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.960
ies, or the umbrellas, spanning over her head.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.490
 And this is three, seven different levels of the white umbrella that span. That also means her

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.960
 inner channels, yeah, they don't pose.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.340
 There is a different many channels in the chakras and all that. But there is also known as seven ch

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.960
akras.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 Seven chakras are that, you know most, the kron chakra, spirit chakra, heart chakra, navel chakra.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:00.960
 Then there is two more chakras. Those are known as then, the chakra of the secret center.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.260
 And then one other chakra, which is known as then, chakra of the fire, fire or the chakra of the

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.960
 wind, wind and fire trigger,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.960
 which will ignite the great blissfulness, and as well as the movement of the wind energy that.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 So those, and then there is, so that way, there is seven chakras.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.960
 So, again, I think we got a little bit below.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:40.400
 The kron chakra, spirit chakra, or kron chakra, spirit chakra, heart chakra, navel chakra, now I

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.960
 will go one.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 And then higher chakra, higher chakra, then below there is called wind chakra,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.960
 and below there is called secret center chakras, or secret center chakra.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.960
 There is, that makes, I think, seven chakras.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.960
 And this is totally enlightened, great blissfulness.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 When you reach enlightenment, everything is completely enlightened, great blissfulness states.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.960
 Because, free from the dualities, because the wind energy, as I think maybe we talked yesterday,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960
 wind is something,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.960
 and that wind, the current wind is completely transcendent into the great wisdom status.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:30.960
 So therefore, all chakras and all channels are in refined, wisdom-like status.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.960
 Everything is glowing in rainbow, in blissful status.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.960
 In order to symbolize that, that glorified, and then seven chakras, or seven umbrellas,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.960
 spreading over her, and spreading the great blissfulness, happy in the dual,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.960
 peace to all the living beings, and to us, to us.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960
 So that is what this symbolizes.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.960
 And then she is, is like all the head.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:05.960
 Hair balls of my, hair balls of my balls, balls of my body, are the splendidly video-wisdom lights.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.960
 Really, let her play.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.960
 Because she is semi-wrathful, or let her model of wrathful status.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.960
 So therefore, then, wisdom-like, and the same way, smacking that.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.960
 That is also not just a light, it's the light of the great blissfulness,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.960
 light of the great wisdom, uplifting status of that wisdom-world.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.960
 And then, she is wearing, aware that, you know, clothes and ornament,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.960
 the peaceful and wrathful Buddhas, all those beautiful ornaments are,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.960
 she is wearing that, which symbolize richness of the Sambokaya qualities.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960
 All the richness.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.960
 Sambokaya is also in the Tibetan called "Lung Jyukzoka".

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.960
 It's not, nothing is really missing.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.960
 Sambokaya means the rich.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.960
 The rich of the Buddha's nature is completely reworked,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.960
 without blurred by, or hidden by the obscurations of the duality.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960
 Therefore, richness is totally glowing, from in and out of all,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960
 to symbolize that, that is all beautiful ornaments are there.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.960
 And now, more than that, then she is also a body member of all Buddhas.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.960
 Buddhas, as I said before, and that is more also she is.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.960
 In her forehead, there is Buddha Varajana.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.960
 Now, all the body aspects of the Buddhas are crown and she embodies,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960
 and that is symbolized by the Buddha Varajana,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.960
 in this syllable "Om" in his head, crown chakras.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.960
 And all the speech of the Buddha, Buddha, she is all embodied,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.960
 and that is symbolized by the Red "A" and Amitabha.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:59.960
 Amitabha in her speech.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.960
 Oh yeah, in the speech center and in the heart also.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.960
 So there is like, here, here, I am sorry, I am doing this correctly,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.960
 and there is like three Buddhas, Varajana Buddha in her forehead,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 up on the chakra, in the speech center, Amitabha in the speech center,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.960
 and Veda Sattva in the heart center, heart center, center.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.960
 And in the Amitabhas, in the heart, there is Varajana's heart,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.960
 there is white home syllables, Amitabha's heart, there is red heart syllables,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.960
 and then in the Buddha Veda Sattva's heart, there is blue homes.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:52.960
 And that symbolizes embodiment of the old Buddha's body, speech mind that she is.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.960
 And then here, through nothing, through me, those things to go home, home, home, home.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.960
 And then in the heart center, in here, her heart center,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.960
 in the deep, here like the great Master Chama Nambuja said here,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.960
 "At the lower part of the mind, heart."

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.960
 Heart, so because I think when we realize the two homes,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.960
 that place letter, I think for the mostly beginner practice,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.960
 next letter, what's called it, inconvenience.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.960
 Therefore, we move to Veda Sattva, that's the lower, lower to me, as you said that.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.960
 But every discomfort, I'm sure it's okay, all in the target, in the right, in the heart center.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 Just if you feel a little uncomfortable to visualize this to the clarification,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.960
 then you can move Veda Sattva, a little bit lower of your heart center,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.960
 and right above there, and then her heart, then you can visualize it on the white home syllable,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.960
 on the moon dresser, as in the teaching center.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.960
 And then circle them under the same thing, as in all the Buddha teachings,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.960
 the Vedana teachings, and her teats, upper teats, teats, ten teats,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.960
 or upper teats represent all the ten ratvadittis,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.960
 and lower teats is all the prima ratvadittis,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.960
 and she has then all these bolts of the upper lip's blessing,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.960
 so the bolts of the upper blessing with fire and tone,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.960
 and the bolt of soul, soul everything,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.960
 and in my portal, the sun and moon, and my body is my plane,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.960
 or she is right in the middle of the western plane, as end of the eons,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:41.960
 and then molecular beings everywhere are instantly salinated,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.960
 and all destroyed burn, everything destroyed,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.960
 and that means everything that's destroyed up there,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.960
 maliciously their intention, thought, or their bad, bad motivation,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.960
 bad action, that complete burn, and everything becomes perfectly enlightened status,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.960
 and now there's no more obstacles and a hindrance,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.960
 everything is transcendent and removed,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.960
 and she is the demotionally dominating, enlightened beings,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.960
 that dominate all the entire universe, all the three realms,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.960
 and all the buddhas and bodhisattvas has as her reactions and her circles,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.960
 and she is the demotionally powerful one,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.960
 and that is now our self, for your self, with that meditation,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.960
 and then with that meditation, circle the matra in heart center,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.960
 as a counter-clockwise way, as often in the teaching centers,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 and then join these prayers, these prayers, this is generally,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.960
 of course, it's translated, but this is really mantras,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
 all these mantras, this is generally Buddha's teaching,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.960
 as I showed yesterday in that text, it's all in there, there, in these mantras,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.960
 then you join this, as the teaching said, seven times, or five times,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.960
 or three times, according your times, you join these mantras,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.960
 and then after that, you join, and this, what's called,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.960
 this the root mantra, which is in bed twelve,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.960
 and then there is a short mantra, which is again very good with mantras,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.960
 you join as much as you can.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.960
 So this is now, what, up to, again, I think, up to, what's called,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.960
 up to this point, in bed seven, up to point seven,

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.960
 is the meditating, and mainly to the head, regular body,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.960
 and our, at that time, we are in the white umbrella status.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.960
 And again, often in the way, visualization, meditation,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.960
 often said, that you have to have three things.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.960
 There's many beautiful qualities that you should have that,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.960
 but, oh, practice it, but, three things is,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.960
 Sarva, Tawkwa, in the Thema, in the Thema, in the Thema, Sarva,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:24.960
 Sarva, S-A-L-W-A, Sarva, Tawkwa, D-A-G-P-A, Tawkwa,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.960
 in the Thema, T-A-N-P-A, Thema.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.960
 So what means Sarva? Clarity.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.960
 And what means Tawkwa? The purity.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.960
 And what means Thema? Stable. Stable.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:51.960
 This clarity, purity, and the stable are very, very important.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:58.960
 And, of course, clarity is, again, for us, for many of us,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.960
 it's not so regular that it becomes clear,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.960
 clear because our concentration is not so strong.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.960
 And therefore, it won't come clear.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.960
 But even though it didn't come clear, always in the teaching set,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.960
 you feel the presence, presence, and you just feel, feel that.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:30.960
 That feeling, feeling is supported by the purity and the stable.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.960
 These are very important.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.960
 If it didn't come clear, clarity, perfectly clear,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.960
 as in the teaching method here, if it comes.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.960
 But if we have the purity and the stable,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.960
 then it will bring the result, bring it.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.960
 And then gradually, it will also become clarity, too.
