00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Thank you all the sangha members, all the Dharma brothers and sisters. First of all, I would like

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 to take this opportunity to extend my very warm greetings and best wishes to all the participants

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 who are here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 And also I would like to thank Kenji Rinpoche as well as all the members for inviting me here and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:47.000
 giving us very warm and traditional welcome from our arrival here in this very beautiful monastery.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.190
 And it reminds me of a great temple so many statues and paintings and offering of this very great

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:10.000
 joy for me to be here and to share some moments with you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.550
 And then I've been requested to give some teachings here. So I decided to give this Mahabhguru Pad

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.000
masambhava's seven line blessing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Because today is the 10th, especially according to some traditions, which is the fifth fundamental,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 which is a very special day.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.140
 So although we did not specifically plant in this way, but it so happened, so it is very auspicious

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.000
 on this day that I'll be bestowing this evening and blessing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 As you know the Buddhism came from India to Tibet in two different periods of time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 The earlier time was the great habit, Samdharajta, Mahabhguru Padmasambhava, and the Devas dharmak

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.000
im, and some of them.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So during that time innumerable teachings brought from India and translated into Tibetan.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:02.710
 And the first time actually I established the Devas dharmakim in Mumbai. And as Kimbrough just

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.250
 mentioned that Sakya lineage is actually founded and established and flourished by the current

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.000
 villages.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:22.260
 And so at that time onwards, the Khandagandharastha was the one of the first Tibetan to receive the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.000
 full fledged bhikshu ordination.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:38.160
 As Tibetans have never received the bhikshu ordination, so there were 7 persons chosen as a trial,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 whether they would be able to keep all the Vinaya rules or not.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So sort of to test it, they have chosen 7 persons, so one of them is a Khandagandharastha.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And so they were all very successful in keeping their Vinaya rules.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.670
 So it was the very auspicious beginning of the created Tibetan monastery, where a number of mon

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:20.000
asteries, where there were hundreds and thousands of fully ordained Sangha members.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.970
 And so the earlier friends were all following the Yumma tradition, and they are all great Yumma

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.000
 masters.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And then after many generations they felt the time has come now to establish a separate school.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.470
 So during the Khandagandharastha, they founded the Sakya school, and all the Yumma teachings were

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.000
 concealed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And then since then, Sakya school belongs to the New tradition. This is the second Buddhist time

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 that another Buddhist started translating and brought many teachings from India.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:28.210
 And this new Sakya school, our main monastery, which is also in the town, is also called Sakya,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.000
 because actually Sakya means the great earth, or white earth.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.400
 And then the original monastery was built in the mountain, which is shaped like an elephant, and in

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.000
 the center of this has a white patch.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So the name Sakya came from that, it means the great earth.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And so this, our main monastery, also we used to say that it has three special kind of qualities.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.720
 And the first one is that a Guru Brahma Sambawara came there when he was totally within, when there

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.000
 was no one there.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:35.180
 And he made the prophecy that in the future there will be a great monastery, and it will benefit

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.000
 many florists, good dharmas, and also benefit many centipedes.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 So he blessed the ground and built four stupas, one stupa on each direction.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.880
 So the very one here said actually the Sakya monastery was blessed and established, first

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.000
 established by the Mahabhu, Brahma Sambawara.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And then the second specialty is the great Indian master, Atisha, who traveled from India to Tibet,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 and on the way he came there in Sakya place.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Of course at that time there was nothing.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.020
 On the white earth he saw seven syllables of letters "B" and one syllable letter "C" and one "Bhum

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.000
".

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.510
 And he said there will be seven emanations of the Ushri and one emanation of the Dhawara Vudeshwara

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.000
 and one emanation of the Bhajar Fami.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.880
 And also in the future there will be many emanations of the deep bodhisattvas, and he did prostr

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.000
ations and made offerings.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 So that was the second specialty.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And then the third is the great Rama Sakya path, Kunga Ninggog.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 In one day the Mahasiddha, because the Sakya tradition has actually innumerable teachings.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And among these the most important is the Lamda, Lammi path.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 It means deserved path including result. That's actually a very abbreviated way of saying.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 It actually means the base path and result altogether.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 So this particular teaching original source is from the Mahasiddha Vruba.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 So the Mahasiddha Vruba himself appeared to the great Rama Sakya path leading to this white earth

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 and said that this earth belongs to me.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So he blessed. So the first one, Mahasiddha Vruta Masambhava.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Second, the Bhagavan Lattisa. And third, Mahasiddha Vruba.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So therefore, of course, we have very special connections.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:33.690
 And so today I am giving this. So according to the ancient or the Nyingma tradition, the teachings

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.000
 are divided into three.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:48.890
 The long lineage, which is based on the Buddha's teachings, they pass down from one master to the

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.000
 next.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And then there are treasure teachings. And then there are pure vision teachings.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.410
 And so this one is actually a treasure teaching. And they are innumerable as you are already

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.000
 familiar with.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.670
 There are many innumerable treasure congress who are actually a combination of Bhagavan Masambhava

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.000
 himself.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And so when the time comes, these damnations will appear and reveal the precious teachings.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.150
 So this one, the history of this particular blessing is in the seven lines, the famous seven line

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.000
 world, say, Gurgaon Masambhava play.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.230
 And it is said actually, it is an invocation prayer to invite Gurgaon Masambhava for the talk of

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.000
 peace offerings.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And long time ago, in India, one of the greatest monasteries here is the Nalanda.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And in the Nalanda, they had a great debate between the heretics and the Buddhists.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.710
 And the Buddhists funded mainly defeat. And so at that time, they were kind of a very desperate

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.000
 situation.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And then many of the Buddhists, they had a dream. In their dream, the jakimis give the prophecy

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 that you will not be able to defeat the heretics.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 So one new way to defeat the heretics is to invite the Gurgaon Masambhava.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And then they ask, where is he? Where is he staying?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 And he's staying in a very far away, in a great, very dark cemetery.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And there's no way to invite him, they say.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.400
 And then the jakimis reply that whoever has the deep faith and devotion, the Gurgaon Masambhava

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.000
 will appear.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 So the fundants made a great offering on the roof of the monastery.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And with incense and also with music, they invited.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 And the jakimis told the fundants to recite the seven lines of Gurgaon Masambhava's prayer.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So they decided, and then instantly the Gurgaon Masambhava appeared on the roof of the monastery.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And then through his great wisdom, he defeated all the heretics.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Then again they reached a challenge with their powers, with their magical powers.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:46.700
 And then the jakimis, the same Gurgaon Masambhava appeared and they were also defeated through the

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.000
 magical powers also.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:02.150
 And then through this, they've been able to defeat the heretics and Buddha Dharma has been able to

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.000
 again flourish in India.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.530
 And so since then, of course, this seven line prayer is very popular among all the teachings, among

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:23.000
 all the monasteries, all of Tibet.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 And then as Gurgaon Masambhava came to Tibet and he gave many teachings.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 And then for the future, for the benefit of the future, fortunate disciples.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And he concealed many treasuries in the lakes, the mountains, and also on Earth.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 And sometimes also in the minds of the special disciples.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 So that when the time comes, these will be revealed.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 So when Gurgaon Masambhava was staying in the southern part of Tibet, this is called the Yalu Sita.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 It is a cave, very special cave.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:25.410
 There, the Harvi Sifuya and the Prince Muthiktambo, two of them made a great feast of them, top of

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.000
 them.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.060
 And then they requested to bestow special teachings and Gurgaon Masambhava gave this particular

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.000
 teaching.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 And then also concealed for the benefit of the future.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 The disciples, followers that he concealed in the minds of the Prince Muthiktambo.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:12.050
 And so then they said, actually during the last century, in the eastern part of Tibet, this Prince

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:18.000
's incarnation of emanation.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 The actual name is Bao Shindoji, but popularly known as Apantheta.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 He was the one who later, after he was one of the later treasury founders.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And so, according to his treasury teaching, this is the essence of the empowerment.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 So now to receive this, as always, the very first thing is to create the right motivation.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.810
 Because whatever practice we do, whatever teachings we receive, where they eventually lead depends

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.000
 on one's own motivation.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:25.160
 So one must have, since this is a very special and very high teaching, one must have the unique and

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.000
 special motivation.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And so that is, space has no limit, so are the sentient beings.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 There's no limit in sentient beings.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 So the limitless sentient beings are all our very dear mother and father and so on.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Because we believe in labor, this is not the only life that we have.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.770
 We have innumerable lives, and we also will continue to have life, unless we attain the liberation

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.000
 and environment.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 And so the life goes on.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 And so therefore every sentient being is actually very closely...
