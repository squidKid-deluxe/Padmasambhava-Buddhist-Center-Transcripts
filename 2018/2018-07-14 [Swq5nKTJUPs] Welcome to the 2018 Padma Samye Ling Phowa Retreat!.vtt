00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 Welcome everyone and welcome. This is the one and again beautiful moment in our lives. Definitely

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.840
 we have wonderful beautiful lives in our lives, many times that we can highlight. We will be

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.120
 thinking and reflecting in our lives. But truly this is one of the beautiful moments in our life.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.600
 We are glorifying our inner beautiful nature. We follow the footsteps of the great

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.960
 Buddhist teacher Bodashakamuni and reflecting his teaching. His teaching is not teaching

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.360
 something the way he's talking something story of the outer space or in the universe or galaxy.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.720
 He's talking true nature of our own self, how we should glorify our self, how we should

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.630
 make ourselves beautiful life, meaningful life, no matter what however we are staying on this earth

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.720
,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.360
 we make something meaningful, tangible. So we live this world with happy, with joys,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.440
 with kind of feel happy, with reward and not leave this world with empty hands, disappointment,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.960
 and kind of in regretful. We live with glorious competence. To do that we are reflecting to our

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.760
 inner nature, great beautiful quality, what we all inherited. What great teacher Bodashakamuni

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.920
 talked

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 about the loving kindness, compassion, joy, happy, peaceful, how to revolve that nature, how to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.080
 make

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.240
 that to our self, make beautiful ourselves and to benefit to the other beings. So that's why I'm

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.320
 talking this one this will be the one beautiful again moment in our life. We're touching to our

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.200
 own true nature, true being, and true rich in the scholars. And therefore again we should feel

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.760
 happy

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.160
 and joy. Joy and happy, this is the one again as he said many times, beautiful time,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.840
 and mighty grateful joy and appreciation. We should bring up those thoughts. At the same time

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.480
 we should combine that joy and appreciation with the body. As gracious teacher Bodashakamuni said

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.120
 and all the master said of one voice have ignited loving kindness compared to all the sentiments

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 including our self. Thank you. We wish really what we're doing together. Not just only helping

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 our local life lead way to our own self, but really wish that made benefit to all the living

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.080
 means. Everyone, many different levels, free from suffering, difficulty, trouble, bring more wisdom

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.080
,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.840
 more understanding, more respect and appreciation to each other. So the world will become more calm

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.360
 and peace and happiness pleaser. So everyone sitting enjoyed that really wish these things.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.480
 And then that also combined with the Vedayana teaching. Vedayana teaching always say that

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.120
 everything is the enlightenment status. This teaching what we're going to follow is the teaching

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.440
 of the Vedayana. Of course it's the Buddha's teaching, but it is the Vedayana teaching.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.430
 So reflecting everything as a purity state, kind of bringing up that, opening that door. Why we don

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.560
't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 see this purity right now? Because due to the cataracts of our duality, it's beloved of true

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.880
 reality, so it's too natural as it is. But at least we opened that door. So cataracts of the dual

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.120
ity

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.360
 happen in bed. We're going to free, remove that. Momentally remove that cataracts of the duality.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.080
 That moment we began to see the glories of the beauty of the nature of the out and in everything

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.480
 in that state. So also kind of lining up ourselves to that situation, not completely close the door

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 and kind of stay in the dark corners. We should not stay there all the time. And of course the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.560
 sentient beings always, we have so many unsure and kind of that unknowing situation that really we

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.080
 don't have anything kind of better understate. If we count the folks of our percentage, how many we

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.080
 know? Maybe two, three percent we know. The resonating eight percent is the darkness. Completely

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.160
 kind of like we don't really know any presumption, hope and expectation status. But reality level,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.680
 according to the teaching of the Buddha, everything is called beauty. Everything is so nice and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.840
 wonderful. That all have to open from our side. It's not going to come from outside to open that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.320
 door.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.730
 We have to open ourselves up. To do that is to be able to understand, is at least to open that door

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.920
,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.480
 kind of leaning toward, not completely closer with the duality as it is or the habit-dependent.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.480
 And then we can't enforce that duality with the kind of like not doing anything. That is then

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.760
 mistakes to us. So therefore we should kind of distant and open those beautiful qualities.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.040
 And then we follow in the other teachings. At this time, during this one-week retreat, our

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.240
 retreat will be known on power, as you all know. Power is the debate of all which means

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.800
 transferring. Why do we want to transfer the consciousness? And that also means in the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.160
 Buddha's teaching, life is a continuation. It's not just one time we take this bird on this earth

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.120
 and then finish. It's not just like finishing the kind of like butter lamb or the lamb

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.800
 blow away by the wind and then it's gone. That's not the case. According to the Buddha's teaching,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 life is continuing. When it started that, life is from the big endless times. And how long it will

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:48.720
 go? Endless it will go. It is like journey of like continually as what is a continued journey.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.320
 That is consciousness. Consciousness is like light. Unstoppable. Undestoible

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:05.280
 as light. Consciousness is. Nobody can destroy. Nobody can stop. Nobody can prevent it.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:15.360
 It is moving force. It moved from the big endless time until now or as we are. And when the wind

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.160
 leave or when our body is finished or that expired or kind of like become kind of what's

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.240
 called unstable or cannot uphold what we are. All elements are become old and they decline.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.480
 And then what is left? The body left behind. But according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.040
 the consciousness continues. It is what continues. So it is just a rough example as like

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.760
 consciousness

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:55.360
 is immovable or sorry, unstoppable, indestructible light that will move continually from one place

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.080
 to the places. In the present time, we are moving how we are moving our consciousness.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:11.400
 With the mercy of our karma. Mercy of our karma. Who created the karma is one's own self we created

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.520
.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:21.840
 That karma. Karma force become as perfect condition, perfect condition or perfect situation

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:31.120
 that will activate it and that will carry on our consciousness. So we don't have any choice.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:38.720
 As I said, it is like in a way, mercy of our own karma deed. Our own deed that will move.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.560
 So the Doha practice, we will practice in Doha. What it does? It will make some directions.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.120
 Again, who's going to make that direction? Ultimately, we are going to do. Each of our

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.080
 self make practicing Doha and make the direction of that. So it's not just a become karmic force,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.160
 carry way, will carries. We make the direction. We make the choice. We stand behind our

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.880
 consciousness.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.760
 And we in a way recollect it.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:20.160
 Present time, the mostly sentient beings, when they pass away, there is no directions. According

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:29.760
 to the teaching, it goes as I said, the mercy of the karma activates it will go wherever.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.560
 So the Poga is so important, so special. And who taught this? Again, the greatest teacher,

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.360
 Buddha Shakyamuni, gave the teachings. When Buddha Shakyamuni reached enlightenment,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:53.680
 age 35, he gave continued teachings until age 81. So over 46 years, or 45 years,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.120
 that he continued to give the teachings. Those teachings are divided as according

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.440
 in my teachings, in my schools of Tibetan Buddhism, nine yana teachings, nine different

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.240
 teachings that Buddha gave. Why he gave many of those many teachings? Because of the

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.920
 individual's motivation, their interest, their kind of like,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.320
 wishes, so Buddha gave the difference, their teachings. Therefore, according to the wish and

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.920
 capability and suitable, each person Buddha made the choice of the teachings. They will

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.040
 well lead the same goal, but according their capabilities. So those level, those called nine

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.240
 yana teachings. All those teachings are teachings that are designed to discover our inner nature,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.320
 make the destination of our beautiful future destination of the next lives, or even up to

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.160
 knives, life after lives. That really will make that. But the Poga teaching is one of the very

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.000
 special teachings of the very yana teachings, very yana, which is the highest center or in it,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.040
 of course, you all know, most of you all know, a few of you may be a lot more familiar with that.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:15.680
 Very yana teaching is known as esoteric teaching of the Buddha, Buddha, Buddha gave that teachings.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.280
 And very yana teaching, what is the teaching? What do you say? If teaching says, for example,

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.120
 like there are those nine yana teachings, but suppose maybe I call nine yana teaching roughly,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.520
 roughly that many of you already know, but how will the first one is known as

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:40.000
 the shara kayana teachings, we, but shara kayana teaching and the second teaching is known as the

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.520
 Parthi Buddha teachings. Most of the time, those teachings are the basic Buddhist school teachings,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:52.480
 you see, that two are shara kai, shara kai, and the Parthi Buddha, first Buddha teaching,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:00.000
 what will Buddha give? Teaching that which is in enlightenment age 35, he give for novel truth

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.360
 teachings. Those all teachings are considered as these teachings of the shara kai, teachings

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:14.240
 of the Parthi Buddha. And ever but more can be simplified, that means foundation teaching,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.720
 foundation teaching means foundation teaching of all Buddha's teachings. All nine yana teachings

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.680
 are best upon those teachings. First Buddha teaching is the foundation teachings, and that

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.560
 is also such as Theravada teachings, and the Sarva-sagavadaka teachings, all those are known as

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:42.000
 deity teaching, and when you practice that foundation teaching practices, realize that

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.760
 you know what you're going to achieve, known as ahadahut, the one who defeated the enemy.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:57.440
 What is that enemy? Enemy is ego clinging, enemy is obscurations, all the negative emotions

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:05.600
 that defeated. So Buddha used the metaphor, the one who destroyed enemy, but according to Buddhism,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.720
 the true enemy is one's own ego clinging, one's own these negative emotions are really true

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:20.080
 enemies. They're not just being enemy for a short time, but they be enemy or opponent, obstacle for

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:28.400
 us from the biggest times. Now always they make a toggle to us. We don't notice, we don't know,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:37.110
 they're behind the scene making obstacles. In the old level, old enemies, they are very

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.000
 contemporary,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.160
 maybe obstacles, not long-lasting enemy as ego clinging as negative emotions, but these ahadahas,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.280
 one who destroyed practicing of these basic Buddhist teaching, what he destroyed,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:13:00.800
 destroyed that long-lasting enemy of the ego and as well as negative emotion together.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:09.280
 Ego is the boss, negative emotions are ready to use, it's like entourage, entourage and all

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:17.120
 joint together make the toggle to us from the biggest time. That's what they are known as enemy,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:24.880
 that's what Buddha used the metaphors. And then third level of the teaching is known as bodhisattva

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.840
 yana. Another name of this is known as the Mahayana teachings. Bodhisattva yana teaching

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:40.960
 can be divided, nor can be divided into two. Causal buddhyana teaching, result buddhyana teaching.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.920
 Causal buddhyana teaching is the alternate, formally known as Suttara Mahayana teachings.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:56.640
 Result Mahayana is known as formally the Vedayana teachings. Teaching, both are,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.200
 Veda is Suttara Mahayana, Veday is Suttara Mahayana, or both are Mahayana,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:10.880
 best upon all that pandeic teachings. Pandeic Buddha teaching, such as Theravada

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:20.000
 or Sarva Isbad, known as Sarva Isbad, or Theravada teaching, formally now, morally. And it's not

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.320
 just

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.040
 modern, it's ancient, ancient name to Theravada. This is the foundation. Veda is Vedayana teaching,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.840
 Veda is the Mahayana, Suttara Mahayana teaching. According to new Mahayana teachings and to very

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:39.840
 Buddhism, all is best upon all on the Theravada teaching and Sarva Isbad teachings. Sarva Isbad

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.240
 is maybe another kind of need, terminology to you, many of you, but Sarva Isbad is known as,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.880
 in ancient time, when Buddha entered Mahaparin nirvana, after 100 years, above 100 years after

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.040
 Buddha's Mahaparin nirvana, the old Buddhist schools of teachings, all were started kind of

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:06.320
 making different schools, known as Theravada schools, and Sarva Isbad schools, and Mankwar Deva,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:13.440
 Parthin Deva, I mean with those you said, but Sarva Isbad and Theravada are Sanskrit world or

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:20.400
 the Pali world. Well, so different schools emerged. In reality, these are all same teaching,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:28.080
 but different schools, teachings. So Sarva Isbad is kind of mainly, kind of become the part of the

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.800
 Mahayana teachings, which is called Vinaya teaching, Sarva Isbad teachings. Theravada is now what

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:34.960
 is

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.080
 called modern time, southern Buddhist schools, Sri Lanka, and Burma, and in Thailand. And the Sarva

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.240
 Isbad school is a northern Buddhist school, such as in Tibet, Mongolia, in China, and then I think

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.360
 Japan, and all of Bhutan, and all those become the followers of the Sarva Isbad schools of Vinaya

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.440
 teaching, or the basic Buddhist school teachings. So the Vaidyana teachings, the Mahayana teachings

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:10.800
 are on the best of these teachings, all rooted on these teachings. So now, these are the Mahayana,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.800
 and then Mahayana, the Suttma Mahayana is Bodhisattva Mahayana, Bodhisattva Mahayana.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:23.360
 Above that, then all is Vaidyana teachings, so that means, above that, according to Nainas,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:30.320
 three of them, now I have listed three, and now the six is, six is all Vaidyana teachings. Those

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.480
 are

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.200
 known as, also, within the Vaidyana teachings, divided into two groups, known as out-tentra,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:45.200
 inner-tentras, and out-tentra is known as kriya-tentra, opa-tentra, yo-a-tentra, those are

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:54.320
 Vaidyana practice teachings, those are known as out-tentras, and why is it known as out-tentra,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.240
 this, even though this Vaidyana practice teachings, this is more, kind of like, communicated and

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:07.440
 associated with the way, world, where things are, kind of more connected to that, that, and

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:15.360
 such as, cultural level, very perfectly clean, beautiful, vegetarian, and all those, just really,

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.880
 like, as, like, in the world, the world, like, considering those are good, that's what they really

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.520
 follow in that, that, and practicing, then meditating, visualizing, and reciting the mantra,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:35.120
 those are out-tentras. The inner-tentra is then, mainly not really focused on the conduct too much,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:45.200
 but more focused on the mind, mind, and activating the nature of the mind, and it's as, as I,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.120
 early I mentioned, and whenever you know, that everything is enlightened status, and more focus

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:58.880
 on that status in, in light state, outward universe is enlightened, our inner mind is enlightened,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:06.160
 physical is enlightened, connecting to that with instruction, and meditating, and reciting mantra,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.640
 but the nature is the same, as long kindness, compassion, relaxed calm, and openness, and that is

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:21.840
 what really practice, so this is called very inner teachings. A more practice is the inner-tentra

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.200
 teachings. Of course, there is many others, but basically what we're going to learn is, I mean,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.280
 there's many poor, poor practices, but what we're going to more focus is the very inner teachings,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.920
 inner-tentra teachings. Now, inner-tentra teaching is about reaching enlightenment within these

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:46.240
 single lifetimes. That is the leading teaching of the inner-tentras, which enlighten or become

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.720
 Buddhahood within these lifetimes, using those instructions and techniques in what Buddha taught,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.160
 with the pull of devotion, pull of joy, courage, commitment, practice, and reaching the ultimate

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:09.040
 goal within these lifetimes, within this lifetime. Somehow, if we couldn't succeed that, succeed

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.680
 that

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:17.760
 goal in this lifetime, then the great teacher, Buddha Chagamuni, taught these poor teachings,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:25.840
 so that we, poor teaching, may then be directed our consciousness, consciousness to the next our

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.600
 favorable spaces, so that we can continually activate our practice, meditate, and engage in

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:43.120
 life. That is the basic meaning of the poor practices. So this is the general understanding

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.040
 of the poor practices.
