00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 This Dzogchen devotion, the application, it's not going into one way. When we have Dzogchen

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.000
 devotion,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 that might make most, ourself may more become more calmer, more peaceful, more soothing, more

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 humble,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 droned in our, developed in so much common sense. Not going to miss this again and again.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 And that bouncing to again, again I did that, or again that happened,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 again that we do that sort of breathing, that some once in a while, to ourself at least.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Even maybe we don't like to omit that, that, that, but we do that to ourself.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Then really, kind of, then and maybe, oh I've been practicing for this many years,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 this many, I don't see result. But how we start, how we live, we doing, and all that.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 People, kind of, many times we see all these foundation practices, these and that things are,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 are to take, or to eat, that, that is ego tricks.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Great master, great master, Malarema never said foundation is, is not necessary, is easy.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Great master, Dzungcheeba never said it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.570
 And Mahan Rambojes, Baba Rambojes, and all those great master says it's not really, those are not

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.000
 necessary.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 They didn't go all, can't be like, shortcut. All of that, and then they become the great masters.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 We called great masters. Why? Because they started so beautiful,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 so humble, so simple, so thoughtful, so practical, and so loving-kindness,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 compassion, humble and simple, dotted art, and started.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Then they become the great, the beacon of the world, truly.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Not just a talking name, beacons, truly they are the beacon of the peace, happiness.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 And when we heard the life story of those, how much is really inspiring to us?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 How much beautiful? Not just inspiring, they so inspired many of those.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 When they read the life story of those great masters, you can take and come from your eyes,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 chaste with joy and with appreciation, kind of completely.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 That is power, power of the cities.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 When we read their life story, it's not just to become more angry, more aggressive,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 more anxiety, more kind of like, my arrogance.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 How that is beautiful, how spiritual. So this is what really is, is, that is.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 So why don't you maintain this, this, and that is known as the primordial wisdom.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 So that is my great talk today, I mean talk to the mind and to all of us.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So now, again, I say this to all of us, really, this foundation is very, very important.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Those Four Noble Truths and the Four Noble Truths, that's what I give the first teaching.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 He didn't even, don't have any other teaching, just giving the Four Noble Truths.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Teaching, many times we think all those are kind of casual, that is a foundation.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Where is the teaching? The Four Noble Truths, the teaching, is the teaching as said.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.220
 It's teaching on the court and the resort, and that is the teaching, is the foundation of the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.000
 entire teaching.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Dzogin is also best on this. Dzogin is rappa. Rappa is the cause.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Rappa is the Buddha nature. It's the Atam God, the God, but it's the Buddha.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 That we have now, you have, I have, everyone has.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 But why we not become Buddha? Because our way of lacking of the conditions, as a sense.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Therefore, to reach enlightenment, to discover Dzogin today, quickly we need these two merits.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.500
 Akhmelech merits, and foreknow section, bodhicetta, joy, devotion, those all really need, very

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.000
 important.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's good for us, good for others. It's so special that we make that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So those are the, I mean, the teaching said, and I'm just repeating that, of course you all know.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Know that, you heard that, you read that in the book, that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 But also thank you very much for the participation, and thank you again.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And I told, generally told, to do some practice, to some Sunday, sunny in the morning.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And again, this time, so much troubles.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And Dzogin, of course, samsara has always troubles, not just now.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 But particularly this time, this, this, this, this pandemic, made so much trouble all over.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I thought maybe do some, to some Sunday praise, which is so special.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 But now we, I didn't have time to do that, but we do this afternoon, maybe tomorrow we do that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Every morning too, to some Sunday practice, and everything, everything you don't have.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 I think, I think maybe you already have those praise.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And also we can, we can, we can send to you of those four.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And just say that, oh, we will send that. So thank you very much everyone, again, participate.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And now we do permanently silence meditation, and then we do the short delegation praise.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And again, thank you, thank you.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Thank you.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Thank you.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Thank you.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Thank you.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Thank you very much.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Thank you.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Thank you.
