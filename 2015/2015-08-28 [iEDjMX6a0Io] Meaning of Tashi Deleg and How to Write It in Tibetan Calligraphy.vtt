00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
 "Okay, this is Tashi Deleg."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 "Okay, first I will start. Now we begin. We begin."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 "Steady?"

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 "First bar, bar, bar, because Tashi has bar, bar before. This bar is perfect. Bar, now bar.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Now I'm going to write a "ka." Again, begin with this "ka" like first appropriate to be it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Now you turn this, and now you're going to make this "reta," this way.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Then you're going to turn slowly this, so that's it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And then now this is the division, that "cha," that we're following.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And then now I'm going to write "cha."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.400
 This again, this, and then this, then this, then this. "Cha," this is a little long, again you

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 break this.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 And now you're going to create another kind of like this, connected to here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So this now becomes "cha." Now Tashi has "ta-shi," "ss," we call it "ini."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 So now I'm going to put again "sa."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 "Sa," "ta-shi."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And now I'm going to put "shi," this is "gugu," "ta-shi," "ini-cha-ai."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And now I'm going to put "gugu," so this, this one, this, this.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And now this is the division line, this is the division mechanism.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And now I'm going to write the "deh-leh." The "deh-leh" has two words, "ba" and "da."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 So now first I'm going to write "pa."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 "Pa," again, this, this, this, so "pa" there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And now this is "ta," I'm going to write "ta."

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And now "ta" there, like this has a "i," "i," "ini-cha-ai" again.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And so I'm going to put "dungo," "dungo."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And so this is division mechanism.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And now I'm going to put "la," because I can't fit here, because "la" has,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 "la" has "ta-shi," "deh-leh," "la" has three words, so it's long.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And first the "la" is "la," "el" like.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And so now, again, "la" and this,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 third, and now this, and then "ka," "ka," now I'm going to.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 "ka," and then "ka," "sa," then this.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And now this has the "deh-leh," again, "i," "dungo," "deh-leh," so "ta-shi" "deh-leh," huh?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Thank you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 "Ta-shi" "deh-leh," and this is, is post, is post word is "tra,"

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 second word is "shi," third word is "deh,"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 and fourth word is "leh."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And so what this means, Rachidiah, now,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 and we say "tra," every kind of word by word, and we start saying "tra,"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 "tra" means "brilliant," "clay," "brilliant."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 "Shi" is "ashpishos," so "brilliant," "clay,"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 every kind of translator, exactly word by word.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So "brilliant," "ashpishos," or the very "clay,"

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 "radiatic," "ashpishos."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 "Deh" is what? "Comfortable."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 "Leh" is "good."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 "Deh" is "happiness," "peace."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 "Deva," "Deva" is "happiness," "peace," "blessfulness," all that.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 So "deh" and "leh" is "good."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So "brilliant," "ashpishos," "blessfulness," "of goodness."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 That's it. And then, that's it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 It's a "tachideleh" in the debate.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 There's no, like, good morning, good afternoon,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 evening, good night, and always it's "tachideleh," "tachideleh."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 You can say it all day, "tachideleh."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 That's it.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 What language does this way of writing come from?
