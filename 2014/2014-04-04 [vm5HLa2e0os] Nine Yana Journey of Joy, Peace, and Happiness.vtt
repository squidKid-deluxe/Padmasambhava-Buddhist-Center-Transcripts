00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 So ancient schools or the Yungma schools, as taught by the great master K.T. Padma Samye Ling

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.200
 Rinpoche and his host of the Yungma Tsewang Rinpoche. And also my hidden teacher, father,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.260
 my Chimi, my dear old students, so I had to follow those footsteps according to my best

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.240
 capabilities and then we move forward. To that context, according to the leaning, always

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.320
 tell us where this, kind of how, this year that the teaching is, come from. And this teaching

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.200
 is of course, it's a Buddha's teaching. Buddha Shakyamuni, who came to Thoden, six hundred

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.280
 years ago, when Buddha gave the teachings, those known as the 84,000 teachings, 84,000

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 teachings that Buddha gave, those old teachings are said in the Dzoketantana. And 21,000, or

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:02.440
 to dispel the 21,000 emotions of the attachment, Buddha gave 21,000 of the Vinaya teachings.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.280
 And order to dispel the emotions of the anger, 21,000 emotions of the anger, Buddha gave

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 21,000 of the teachings of the suttas. Order to dispel the emotions of the ignorance, Buddha

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.480
 gave 21,000 of the teachings of the abhidhammas. And Buddha ordered to dispel all the emotions

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:40.840
 of the attachment, anger, in ignorance, Buddha gave 21,000 of, of very young teachings. So

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 those all makes 84,000 teachings of the Buddha. 84,000 teachings are summarized at all the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.000
 nyungmach schools, which are very Buddhism. These are known as the nine yana teachings,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.280
 nine yana teachings. These nine yana teachings are known as three outward teachings, nine

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:16.280
 yanas and three inner yanas and three separate yanas. So those are nine yanas. And order

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 to give the teachings of the inner, outwardly, three outward teachings, Buddha, if we ask,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:33.080
 bodhisattva kamuni. Bodhisattva kamuni with fully orange moon with single handle in the way, just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:44.360
 moon with major and manual marks, those golden colors. With that form, bodhi give three outward

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.790
 wiggles, yana teachings. Those are known as then the harvok kyana and the partic bodhayana and bod

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.320
hisattva

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:02.200
 yanas. So three outer yana teachings Buddha gives. And Buddha appeared in the form of the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:13.960
 vidya dharas of great bodhisattvas, such as vedya pani, magi shiri and avalok krishwara and that

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.960
 form. Buddha gave three inner tantra teachings, inner wiggles, those are known as kryayana,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.360
 opayana and yoga yanas. And Buddha appeared from the buddhasamad vada, vedya dharas,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.400
 vedya sattvas. And Buddha gave three inner, three seveda teachings or yanas, those are known as

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:49.160
 maha yoga, ano yoga and ati yoga teachings. So those are all known as nayana teachings.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.840
 These nayana teachings again is that every teaching, generally there's no really difference

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 between any of those teachings. Everything is designed and teaching to discover our

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 inner buddha nature and our inner nature according to the readiness of the practitioners, their

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.720
 readiness to discover our buddha nature. And that means also one same time just spilling the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.000
 hindrance, that blocking of the realization of the buddha, of the buddha nature. And those are

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.880
 negative emotions as mentioned earlier and you all know. And those are the negative emotions

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.240
 are known as negative emotions and very subtle emotions. Negative emotions are the gross level

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:48.120
 as I named and you know ignorance, attachment, anger and combination, all those are the gross

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:56.680
 intimate levels. Deep down emotions what are, deep down root of those emotions is grasping,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.160
 clinging. Clinging and grasping is the fundamental of the truth to come out of this,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.080
 these all negative emotions. And according to the readiness of then Buddha gave those teachings.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.400
 In the teaching Buddha never actually of course never forced according to their readiness,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.040
 it's a very gentle, peaceful approach to discover their inner inner nature. Therefore practicing

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:33.720
 dharma is joy, practicing dharma is happy, peaceful, it's delight, it is beautiful goal. Discover

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.960
 our inner inner nature. We're not making any kind of clutching to each other or in different areas

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.480
 with joy, with appreciation, with love, with kindness, with compassion, exploring the beauty

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.800
 of ours and help to the others according to their capabilities or our capabilities we have

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.960
 to support with that context with respect, appreciation, harmony, peace and non-violence.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.400
 So therefore all we practice at the time. Day one we started practicing teaching of the Buddha

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.160
 all the time to be discovered in the nature of the enlightenment. It is a journey of joy,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.880
 journey of peace, journey of the happiness and peace. That's what it is.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.480
 And with this understanding so therefore
