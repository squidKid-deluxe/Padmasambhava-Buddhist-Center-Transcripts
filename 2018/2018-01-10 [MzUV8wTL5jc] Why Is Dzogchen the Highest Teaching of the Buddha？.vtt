00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 In the Padma, why is it called highest teaching? As I said, and we all have heard so many times,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 it is the direct, more simple teaching, direct teaching of the primordial wisdom,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 and also more simple to discover the primordial wisdom, Dzogchen is so simple.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 So, so simple. And so therefore, it's simple as a thing, it's direct,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 and there is nothing more profound or more teaching than this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 As I said earlier, even Buddha Samyant Bada Ruhman,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 there is nothing, anything more to say than this, as the teaching said.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 So that's it. And also this teaching is, as I said,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 all other teachings are teachings of that dispelled conception by conception.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.420
 Exactly. But this Dzogchen teaching is not conceptual teaching, it is innate primordial wisdom

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.000
 teaching.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Nogget is teaching. Therefore, it is called highest teaching, the most sophisticated,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 more direct teaching. And so now,
