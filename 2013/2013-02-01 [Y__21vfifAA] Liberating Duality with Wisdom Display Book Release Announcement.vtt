00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 Thank you, thank you, Thapa. This is a new book. I think maybe many of you already saw. This is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.000
 called "Liberating the Duality with Wisdom Display."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.740
 It's a Kinti Parthikarambhutji, and I also again, I had always go under His wings, so I had the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.000
 opportunity to be with Him and think about these teachings.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.280
 And so many years ago and then recently, they already is quite added, but recently Thapa, I think,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.000
 I mean, they work hard and to finish this on this special day.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 It's the honor of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche. And there's also a lot of prayers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 So thank you for the prayers of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, Austin Chintze, and the great Master

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.000
 Maha Rinpoche, and so forth.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Thank you, thank you very much. This is called "Liberating the Duality with Wisdom Display."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.950
 Actually, why we said it, always the Kinti Parthikarambhutji says the activity of the Murbhi Masamb

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.000
hava is not just a kind of, commonly can be easy to understand it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.340
 Murbhi Masambhava fly in the sky and transform all the like waters into the vines and holding the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.000
 motion of the earth until it stops the sun setting.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 And so his line of activities in the teachings says that we immediately kind of like can't believe,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.000
 blow waves out.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.830
 But however, if you don't have a good color, we go out of the duality boundaries, then everything

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.000
 is open.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Stadom is not just limited, the playground, playground is not limited, the playground is green.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.200
 You can play all kinds of things and therefore then everything can be done, walking in the sky or

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 walking on the water and transforming water into fire, fire in the water and the stone in the gold,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 gold in the stone.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 I mean you can do all different things every year out of duality frame.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.850
 And this is what the Murbhi Masambhava is just for you. So they use the title as a liberating dual

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.000
ity with the wisdom, this place. That's it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Thank you very much.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Thank you again. Thanks for coming. Thank you.
