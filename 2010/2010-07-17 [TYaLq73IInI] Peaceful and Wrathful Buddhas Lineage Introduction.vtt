00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you very much for coming and thank you.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Again, as we all know, this is our annual Dzogki Retreat.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 After Dzogki Retreat, our summertime in the beautiful land, our Dzogki Retreat Center,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 being very renewing, re-energetic, reconnecting, and re-dippening our practices all the time

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 between one of the very beautiful times that we are gathering,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 I think we are young to sing the song by a great master in the union

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and see the good three summer seasons.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 I don't know exactly all the word in our own English, you can't translate it that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 But it says three summer seasons, gathering together, seeing the beautiful things,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.080
 even we don't have to visualize, is it something very beautiful, a blessed, what's called exalted

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.000
 places?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Exalted something. His beauty is truly his being.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 And Padma Samye Ling is one of the beautiful places on this planet.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It has totally beautiful beauties of natural beauty.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.620
 And above that, there are so many blessings and relics of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru Deva and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 Dzogki.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 By all of us, together, with love, with compassion, with wisdom, we build this monument.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 It is glowing, it is shimmering, it is vibrating, it is sizzling.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 It is really life. It is a beautiful breakfast spot.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And we are all here in these beautiful places.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 These come so beautifully without burdens, difficulties, troubles, hardship,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 so many kind of agony things one after another.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Therefore, it is a simultaneously developed, glory-inconceivable lotus of land.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And that's what we are all here today, again.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And we are renewing, re-energizing our practices.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 This year, we changed the teaching, as all of you know, the situation and circumstances.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 This year has been one of the very profound teachings, many levels to all of us.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 We heard the teaching many times, times, and some really also be practiced theoretically.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.730
 But this year has been one of the, again, strong lessons and teachings that Buddha and Gurga Masam

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 have,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 they need a master's tool.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 And, again, many of you may be received these peaceful, radical practices of the Karmalupa,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 or many other great masters.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 But today, again, we are reconnecting that profound, very powerful, profound teaching,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 as this year, we are reconnecting something really very deep, deep in stone.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And in one way, we lost something we all love dearly.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 But on the other hand, it really created such a profound, in fact,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 and kind of deepened into the spiritual, our value, and iconic quality,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 and that what we all talk, think, in brain, but today, it's kind of observing the heart.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 So it is a very kind of profound and beautiful time of all of us.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And this time, then we progress to the original teaching,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 or kind of let the renew of our understanding of the peaceful, radical duty practices,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 as we have this short sadness, that's what we're trying to follow.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And the same time we practice this every day, 49 days, as many of you all know,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 and you heard this as offering to great master, K.G. Bali Shira.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And as well as also in the open teaching said, great masters,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 when they also entered Mahaparinarana, is good through the practices.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 It was deep named our practice, our meditation,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 and not just to ours, but also it really can benefit to many levels,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 the beings by these practices when we do this.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And this is what we are doing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And also, as the teaching said, it's good to do practices.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Also, even as great masters, there's many different kind of like samaya,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 like connections, and the blockages, and so forth, connected with the student.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And that sometimes, almost there will be kind of like hindrance and blockage

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 to moving forward to those great masters, their realization, moving apart.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 So we practice such a lot of meritorious activities that will help to also

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 to continually move forward the great inspiration of the great masters.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And the same time to us, to all the beings.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 So all those contracts, multiple levels, multiple purposes,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 we practice this 49 days, and it's been wonderful.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And from the world, we practice it, from India to Russia, all the way here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And many other, also other Dharma centers that were connected to us,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 and they've kindly, very kind of beautiful, supported their practice

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 in meditating in the name and honor to the Kingdom of India.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Many centers emailed us and told us that.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So it's a kind of very, very special time to practice it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 So now, those are the general kind of ideas, and I'm again so grateful

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 and thankful for all of you, your support, your kindness, your compassion

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 to all these times. It's not just to me, but to all of us.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And one way again, we all love to same person as great teacher,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 great master, great friend, great guidance,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 and very beautiful, simple friend who plays with us, yoga with us,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 and with many kind of almost, what's called, simple kind of like village,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 child style, that jogs with us. That's what's really, and one way we're missing this.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 But however, again, it's something very profound, teaching lesson

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 that we received in our heart, in mind, that that was there,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 and that was really juvenile, and it has become what's called manual,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 to grow our realization and the growth of that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Manuals are not always so pleasing, I think.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 The subject may be miracle growth.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 That is miracle, but otherwise, manuals are not so pleasing.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 But it's very strong in faith, it helps to grow.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And similarly, this time, it's been one of the strong manual for us,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 organic manual, that really stands in our practice and meditation.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So this is what we have.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And now, we're talking about what we're practicing here.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And this is the physical right for the practices, as like introduction.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 And tomorrow, I'm going to offer also the involvement of the turma, black turma,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 according to the teachings and lineage of the taxon nampa,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 as well as his new nampa, combined target.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 That was him who told me that last time, that he's planning to do that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 That's what he said.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 So I try to do as much as my capabilities to kind of continue to reactivate

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 and to keep his legacy.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 And not just me, that's all of our struggle.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And that's the purpose of the practice, resilient teaching.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So that's what I will do tomorrow, the involvement of the black turma.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 But this time, we are practicing the chit-o.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Now, about the chit-o practices, chit-o is, of course,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 one of the great teachings of the nimma schools,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 the great Buddhism, is teaching of the nirvana sambha.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Teaching of the nirvana sambha.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And then, in nirvana teaching, often you heard so many times,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 it's called kama teaching and dharma teaching.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 This is dharma teaching.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Generally, nimma teaching is a kutudu.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 It passes through three lineage systems.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Those are known as mind-to-mind realization, transmission lineage,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 and then the symbolic transmission lineage,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 and then oral transmission lineage.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And so those are the generally nimma teachings

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 that are combined with both kama and dharma teachings.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Then dharma teaching is something again special.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Maybe we'll talk this more about it in the teaching itself.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 I think it has all those things, so we're going to do that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 But this is dharma teachings.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Dharma teaching is something very, very special, as you all know.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 It is very direct teachings from the Gaurabhama sambha,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Vasiram Dakini Shinsoja, to that dharma,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 whoever reversed that dharma by that teaching.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 That dharma, because it's direct, therefore it is very fresh teaching.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 There is not much dilute by the conceptions.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 It's from Gaurabhama sambha, his own world, and Vasiram Dakini Shinsoja.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 His own and left, or maybe her own also teaching,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 and then to that dharma.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 That dharma, therefore openly named,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 it has the warmth of the breath of Dakini's teaching.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So it's so fresh, it's so light.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 It's just the same as broadcasting right that moment to you,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 from the Vemma sambha, to you, to our A, to our A.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Therefore, it is considered very, very special dharma teaching.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Then there are also many peaceful rathas,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 who have practiced to many great dharma sambha in the world.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Many great dharma sambhas,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 but among all those great dharma sambha,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 there are peaceful rathas teaching, or the shuttle teaching.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 The dharma namba teaching is very powerful and extended, very true.
