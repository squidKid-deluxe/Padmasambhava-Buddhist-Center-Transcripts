00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone's participation and thank you

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.800
 again. Now again, we are going to reflect the teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:23.200
 Therefore, again, we reactivate our motivation, and that is the foundation of every good activity.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.920
 Generally, motivation is really everything. Everything that we do in the samsara or in

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.000
 the Rana, all start with motivation. Therefore, correct motivation is so important, and keep

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.560
 that good motivation all the time. That's the way we progress our practice in meditation,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.720
 and that's the way we get that beautiful motivation. Well, bring our full bloom or

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.760
 full fruit, full actualizing result, accomplishment. Therefore, we should always start with good

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.920
 motivation, and this motivation is nothing. It's something different, extraordinary, or something

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 we have to do special. No, just activate our good heart, good qualities of the mind, which is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.080
 always

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.880
 in the teaching, joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation, thankful, grateful. To all the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.800
 circumstances in the college and opportunity we have, really thankful, grateful, but at the same

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.040
 time have courage and commitment that I'm going to use this all beautiful opportunity to make even

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.600
 something more beautiful, more good things for myself, as well as all other beings. That's how

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.480
 we begin our practice of Dharma. That really is so important, and we keep that motivation as much

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.720
 as

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.600
 we can all the time, day and the night and the morning and the evening all the time. Then it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.440
 good. Then together with that, in bodhijata, and that we're going to discuss today also more,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.520
 bodhijata, love and kindness compared to thought of all living beings. That means all beings,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.960
 regardless of what situation, circumstance, or what maybe they are. But in Buddhism,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.640
 called the beings of six realms, so it's not just only human beings. All the beings have that love,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 kindness, compared to thought. From the core of our heart, really we say that is the essence and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.880
 foundation, very foundation of the Buddha teachings. With that, then in purity understand,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.520
 purity understand, or purity realizations. Everything is in purity status, generally.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.320
 We don't see right now, due to our duality and grasping, it kind of blocks that. Otherwise,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.400
 really reality, everything is beautiful. Subject is beautiful, object is beautiful,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.080
 everything is enlightened, the Muslim state is beautiful. There's no names of suffering,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.880
 the difficulty challenging impures that exist there at all. But that because due to mishandled by

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.120
 our

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.160
 own duality mind, and then it's all kind of happened, but reality is beautiful. Now we're

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.040
 going back to that purity state, therefore, reactivated that right now is also so important

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.640
 according to the teaching. With those beautiful motivation, and now we go to the teaching itself,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.000
 and that is we've been doing, we're going to go in this teaching, on this teaching for a few days,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.280
 and now we're going to, we're going to, if you have this electrical piece, and whatever

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.320
 poem you have, it's according this, page 13. Page 13, the root of dharma is bodhicada,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.160
 we're going to start there. We discuss already all the different aspects of these teachings

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.200
 that already, so we won't, I won't repeat that again today, and go to the bodhicada. And bodhicada

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.120
 also I said, not just I said, according to teaching, first it is rafuddhi is so important.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.760
 We discuss that, making close connection to the Buddha dharma sangha with the confidence,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.560
 with the appreciation, with the devotion, those are known as rafuddhi, making close connection,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.680
 contact, contact, that is rafuddhi. Once we develop this bodhicada, or sorry rafuddhi, then

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.840
 Mahayana teaching, then we develop the bodhicada. Again, I'm sure many of you know already this,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.600
 but in Buddhism, there is two schools. One is known as the best basic Buddhist school,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.120
 and which are often named also sometimes Hinayanas, but many times they're using now these days,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.280
 basic Buddhist school. And the second is Mahayana, sutta Mahayana teaching, teachings

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.440
 on bodhisattva yanas, maybe we just use bodhisattva yanas. So there's three schools,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.080
 basic Buddhist school means what? Bodhisattva yana is the best on the basic Buddhist,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:26.800
 schools, or which is often many times named as Hinayana. So means bodhisattva yana is the best

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:36.640
 on the basic fundamental Buddhist school, which Buddha taught at age 35 for a long time.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.560
 According to basic Buddhist school, Buddha gave all their teachings until he reached enlightenment,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.960
 or sorry, until he entered Mahaparinarana, Buddha gave that teaching. So that is a basic Buddhist

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.480
 school known as commonly many times Hinayana schools, or Shravaka yana schools, those are that.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.560
 And now today we're going to discuss here Mahayana, ombodhisattva yana teaching.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.440
 Mahayana means what? Of course, most of you know that. In Sanskrit world,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:19.840
 Maha means great, yana means weakle. So great weakle, great weakle is not externally kind of weakle

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:28.640
 that lived and carried way, but this weakle is our intention, intention, our thought,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:37.120
 our intention. What that intention I will discuss the other day to simply say is good heart,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:45.920
 the big good heart, not just a good heart, big good heart, heart, every make that big little

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.440
 mode, another terminology, then compassion, not just a compassion, but big compassion,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:03.440
 the gigantic compassion. Really that is the big compassion, big loving kindness, big joy, joy,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:13.840
 and big balance in equanimity and openness mind, open heart, not tight. That big, that's called

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:23.680
 great. That is that if we have that, that will a limited ourself like weaker, that will lift up us.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:34.080
 This time we are grounded with a small, small mind on the samsara, small, even we have love,

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.760
 we have compassion, we have joy, we have the equanimity, all those balance is small.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:48.320
 It's really restricted, small love, small compassion, small joy, kind of fragile love,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:58.880
 fragile compassion, fragile joy, and fragile equanimity or balance. Mahayana means big vehicle,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:07.120
 the big, big heart. That is really Mahayana. And we have that, that's really weaker like motorcar

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.720
 or like aeroplane. It will lift up from samsara to the enlightenment state. Even transcendental,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:24.640
 all our perception, the conceptions, our ideas become completely big, gigantic, not limited,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.080
 restricted, and tight, and kind of bouncing all the time, that clacking all the time. No,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:40.560
 open, relax. That is Mahayana. How that started? With the bodhicap, bodhicap, that is what,

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.600
 therefore, here, great master, his Holiness, Chabjya Dhanuram, he said, "The root of dharma

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.200
 is bodhicata." Root of dharma, every achievement, every spiritual, good practice, is really best

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:02.240
 upon this bodhicata or this simple way I've translated, the good heart and compassion.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.040
 Bodhicata is a Sanskrit word, of course, you know, it has two meanings.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:16.400
 Compassion and wisdom combined together. Compassion. This time, as I said, compassion is a big

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.720
 compassion. Compassion, that combined with the wisdom, inseparable. So wisdom and compassion,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:32.640
 united together, that our beautiful qualities, your beautiful qualities of heart, united together

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:43.200
 with the big compassion, big wisdom, are joined together and projecting to all living beings,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.000
 to like, every living being, I like to be free from sufferings. I like to make everyone happy,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.160
 joy, peaceful. I like to bring every living being to the peaceful status, happiness status,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 forever and ever. That attitude is compassion. How in order to do that, what we can do? Even

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.840
 we have that motivation, we cannot do immediately to bring that. For that reason, we're going to

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:21.200
 project our wisdom mind to the enlightenment, to become the Buddha or to get practices. So we will

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:30.560
 become more stronger, more stable. Our love and compassion and joy and equanimity become wider

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:39.040
 and wider and stronger and stronger, bigger and bigger, and then boneless status. That's what you

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:49.680
 heard. Boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy, and boneless equanimity. Boneless.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:59.600
 That boneless, boneless and obtainent attitude is the poor boneless. Poor boneless are best upon

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:09.300
 the bodhicitta, best upon compassion, best upon the wisdom, best upon the concerning, caring

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.520
 thought

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:18.080
 for all living beings, and best upon also the wisdom that perfectly enlightens natures.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:26.240
 Those are what are known as the essence of bodhicitta. So with this now understanding,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:34.560
 bodhicitta can be like what is the nature of bodhicitta and what is the duration of the bodhicitta,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 and what kind of bodhicittas. Those are teaching mentioned, so I will kind of highlight those,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.440
 two of those, then I'll go a little bit each of those. Of course, many of you already know that.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:54.160
 First, already I explained the nature of the bodhicitta is the union of compassion and wisdom.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.400
 Compassion is projecting to all living beings, as I said. And what this means, compassion is

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.200
 thinking of all these living beings having so many difficulties, so many troubles and challenges,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.480
 even their gain heart, which is joy, peace, happiness, but reality really always bouncing

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.440
 with the challenges and difficult troubles, not achieving what they like to be achieved,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.800
 their desire is not really fulfilling all the time, but therefore feels great compassion.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.640
 Compassion for all these beings who are struggling so many levels, really feels that I like to help

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.800
 all of them, like to preach from their sufferings, not just the sufferings or the cause of their

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.760
 challenges, the cause of difficulty, troubles, sincerely from thinking that is known as

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.920
 but their compassion is projecting to the all living beings. In order to make that

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:06.400
 fulfillment that which comes true, then we have to equip ourselves. For that reason, we practice

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.560
 and meditate to purify our obscuration, our negativities, so that we can help with all the

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:20.560
 beings freely, easily, openly and pervasively, and without any boundaries and restrictions. For

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:20.880
 that

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.000
 reason, then practice, which is obtained in the teaching said, wisdom is projecting to the

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.320
 enlightenment, compassion is projecting to the all the living beings, united together with the

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:44.720
 compassion is known as the body. So those are the nature of the body. Then the body can be divided

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:55.280
 into two groups. Those are, of course, many of you know that, related to the body and the absolute

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:03.040
 truth of the body. There is a true body, relative to the body and absolute true body. Now, first

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.600
 we talk absolute, sorry, relative to body together. Relative to body together has two divisions,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:18.640
 sub-divisions, relative to the body together has two sub-divisions. Those are known as wishing

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:26.480
 body together and actualizing body together. And that is, for example, when we pray, when we do

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:36.400
 the aspiration prayers, or end of our practices, we do those preface the body together, those who

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.120
 don't have, may they have the body together, may they have the body together. Those who don't have

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.320
 the body together, may they have the body together, and those who have body together, may they

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.040
 always

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.040
 increase, never demolish, demolishing that. Someday we have that prayer. That is roughly here,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:03.200
 how it is. The preface of the body together, in those without it, may it be generated. In those

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:12.470
 who have it, may it be never demolished, but always continually increasing. That is what the prayer

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480
 of

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.640
 the body together is. Post-preface of the body together is the nature of the body together.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.000
 That's what I said already. What is the nature of the body together is the union of compassion

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.560
 and wisdom that is the preface of the body together. It is precious. Why is it called precious?

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.200
 Because

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 it is really like wish-fulfilling duels. It performs all our wishes, and we have this body

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.800
 together. It performs all the wishes. It removes our obscurations, negativities. It performs our

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.400
 all the wishes of the good thoughts, good hearts. God, and what is the great Master Shanti Deva

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.720
 said,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.720
 is the wish-fulfilling trees. Body together is the wish-fulfilling trees. When you have the truly

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.920
 body together in our heart, then everything will become so beautiful. Let everyone become your

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:16.080
 friends. Everyone will protect us, help and support us. The body together will demolish our

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:25.440
 obscurations. It increases our marital activities. From those people who have the body together,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:32.880
 their name will be changed forever. What is their name? Bodhisattvas, male and female. From that

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.560
 onward, they are the support and help to all the business. They're traveling from light to light.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:48.880
 They're never going to travel from dark to dark in the dark. They become brighter and brighter,

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.720
 happy and happy. That's what really Bodhisattvas is. Therefore, it is a precious body,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:03.520
 body together. Those who don't have this may generate it. How to generate this? Generate that

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.560
 with knowing the call and meaning of the body together, then we generate the body together.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:15.600
 That is wishing-body together. We generate the first wishing-body together. Wishing-body

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:25.520
 together is, again, the already I mentioned, that poor, boneless is wishing-body together,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:37.440
 love, compassion, joy and equanimity are the essence of wishing-body together. As I said earlier,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:46.400
 there are two kinds of loves. Generally, love and then bodhisatta loves. Generally, compassion

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:54.720
 and bodhisatta compassion. Generally, joy and bodhisatta joy. Generally,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:05.200
 equanimity and bodhisatta generosity. Generally, love, compassion, joy and equanimity, we all have

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.520
 that.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:13.200
 Every living being has some degree, which is good. It's a good heart. It is

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:22.000
 very chory. It's virtuous. It's good, but that is not called bodhisatta. Love and compassion and

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.080
 joy and equanimity. Why? Bodhisatta love and compassion has no boundaries, no limitations,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:38.400
 no restrictions. So therefore, what is named in practice time means poor, boneless.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:48.240
 Because that is something, bodhisatta love is more excessive than the general love,

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:55.120
 general compassion. It's more expensive, as I said earlier, too. It's really a very

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:05.520
 powerful space. Boneless love to boneless beings. Boneless beings. That means what? The number of

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.960
 sentient beings has no numbers. There are no numbers for the living beings in Buddhism.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.200
 As what great master, great teacher, Buddha said in teaching, as far as space goes, sky goes,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:33.040
 that far there are living beings. And as long as there are living beings, that much everyone has

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:41.760
 emotion and karma. As long as they have emotion and karma, that much they all have

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:53.120
 difficulty and challenges. So therefore, there's boneless living beings. Therefore,

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.440
 our love or the bodhisatta love is boneless for all living beings, for every being,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:07.920
 without any restrictions. So boneless love for the projection to the boneless living beings,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:15.040
 and therefore, in the teaching said, it has boneless marriages. The merit of the more can

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:23.120
 be not measured. It is really so powerful, so special, that in a means of the love,

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:30.640
 you're spreading out without any boundaries. So that means indirectly, we're knocking down the

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:40.000
 ego clings, self-important attitude is a little bit kind of slowing something. This ego clinging,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.040
 self-important, is the fundamental troublemakers in the samsara according to Buddhism. It's really

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:55.200
 troublemaker all the time. It may trouble from the biggest time, now until now. It acts in our

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.000
 sight,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.360
 but reality really is bouncing us all the time, the ego and self-important attitude.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:10.160
 That's why self-important ego is making all the troubles. All the troubles, for example,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.240
 in individually troubles or personally trouble is making, just personally trouble, is making

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.240
 trouble to the within the families, is making trouble with within the friends, is making trouble

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.720
 within the our neighbors and communities in the country and then larger scales according their

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.840
 capabilities. This is the ego clinging and self-important and surrounded by all the different

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.840
 emotions. One happens, act there are the kind of defensive of the support of us, but reality is

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:48.880
 bouncing us to the more trouble, more difficulty, more challenge, more disappointment, and more

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.120
 kind

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.160
 of crushing us, our joy and peace, hope and vision and goal in the dreams. Really is so much.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:04.880
 So therefore, this thinking of this boneless love, it is crumbling that is in the behind the scene,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:12.400
 the self-important attitude, ego cleanliness too. Therefore, it is so powerful. Then same way,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:20.560
 compassion. Compassion, boneless compassion for all the beings and boneless joy,

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:30.240
 boneless joy, appreciation, thankful, happy. Anybody was having good kind of result,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:38.640
 achievement, but celebrating that and ignite that. Our heart is singing with fulfillment

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.400
 and good lives of other ones, really happy and joy and peace. And we have that attitude.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:52.640
 According to Buddhism, it is so much merit. It is completely, that attitude of joy is free from the

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:59.040
 jealousness, heady thought, and ego clinging, or it's demolishing the ego clinging some degree,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:08.240
 and opening our heart and mind. It therefore is increasing, in the teaching said, increasing

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:16.320
 meritures. It purifies our obscurations, obstacles, habit patterns. So that is known as a tune.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:24.880
 Then, equanimity is balance. Balance, many other ways. That means we are equal.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.720
 All living beings are equal. We are all equal with everyone.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:39.040
 Which level? Which level? In what, what level we are equal? Because feeling level, we are equal.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:48.240
 Our desire level equal. What we have the feeling, they have similar that feeling. That means what?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:56.400
 We like to be happy, they like to be happy. So that level same. And we like to be, we don't like

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:03.920
 to be suffered. They don't like to be suffered. That level same. There's no difference. And we

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.960
 like to be happy and joy, peace. We like to perform our wishes. That others like the same thing.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.120
 They

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.600
 like to perform their wishes. They like to perform their dreams. Dreams. There's no difference.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.040
 Everything. And then also structural level. The old human beings, the animals at this world,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.080
 share the same thing. Really structural level, biological level. Live five organs and senses

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:39.280
 and all those are same. And we all rely on this earth. We breathe in the same air. We drink the

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:49.200
 same water. We bath in the same sun, warmness of suns and the moon, the stars and the air.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:25:01.120
 Same. No difference. Every level really same. And therefore, no one is really want sadness and

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:09.040
 suffering the difficulty. But yet is struggling with everyone some degree. Even we are known as,

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.720
 our human beings are known as upper realms, higher realms, but still we have so many challenges and

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:23.440
 difficulties. And one after another. Therefore, then this body jetta is the great medicine to heal

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.920
 all those troubles, difficulty challenges, and bring their performance. So that's the poor,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.360
 boneless thoughts. With this thought, those are the brain. Then I think many of you already know.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:44.960
 Now you develop generally in the boat. Now with this poor boneless, we develop this actualizing

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:52.320
 body jetta. Actualizing body jetta, when we have the knowledge and understanding of this,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.520
 then we receive the blessings and the lineage blessings of both each other. Both each other,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:04.960
 those are known as taking the vows. Vows of body jetta. Then we're going to activate body jetta.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.680
 That activating body jetta is that with thinking of all living beings. Again, the same thing now.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.360
 Same that poor, boneless attitude in the heart and the mind. With that, we're going to help to all

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.120
 beings, everyone, and how to start with that. That here, here, great Master, his son, Dunyun,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.200
 will sit here. So that is activating body jetta according to this one. Then what is this?

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.440
 In those, without it, may it generate it. So that means that our waking body jetta is developed,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.760
 and therefore, then you take the vows or take the lineage blessings, and then, now what are you

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:50.080
 going to do? Those who have it, may it never be demolished or damaged. That means how we're going

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:58.320
 to maintain that, and then how to progress is here. His only Dunyun would say it. Benefiting others

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:06.480
 is the activity of the conqueror's offsprings, or conqueror's son and daughters, a symbol which

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.800
 oscillates. That's it. Conqueror's son and daughters. So the activity of the benefiting,

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:21.280
 that is then keeping the body jetta actively. How we keep that actively body jetta and progress

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:29.360
 state. That is six paramatas. Six paramatas. And the six paramatas is then, of course, I think many

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:38.320
 of you already know, the generous paramata, and the morality paramata, and the patient paramata,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:48.480
 and the joyful effort to the virtuous paramata, and then concentration paramata, and

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.840
 the wisdom, or the pandya paramata. Those are the six paramatas, I think.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:07.440
 I say six, yeah, six paramatas. Those are the six paramata practices, and that is all

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:20.720
 better. Generous paramata is best upon poor boneless, and the morality paramata is best

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.560
 upon the poor boneless, and the patient paramata is best upon the poor boneless.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:35.680
 Joyful effort for the virtuous paramata is best upon poor boneless,

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:42.160
 and then the concentration as well as the pandya paramata, all best upon the

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:53.520
 six paramatas, all best upon the poor boneless. So now I said earlier to you,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:01.600
 body jetta can be, not can be, has two divisions. The relative true body jetta and absolute true

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.800
 the body jetta. Relative true body jetta has two subdivisions, is reaching body jetta, actualizing

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:16.330
 body jetta. That is relative body jetta. Whatever, then absolute body jetta. Absolute true body j

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:16.720
etta

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:25.520
 is understanding the meaning and the nature of the relative true body jetta. So that means what?

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:34.640
 The nature of the, for example, nature of love is what? Absolute level nature of loving-kindness,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:43.680
 bounded love, is emptiness. And boneless compassion, nature of the boneless compassion

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.800
 is emptiness. And nature of the joy, boneless joy, is emptiness.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:00.400
 And nature of the equanimity, boneless, is emptiness. And I'm sure you understand that.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.840
 What that means? We're talking about the love is so special. It's true.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.600
 Boneless love is so special, so beautiful, so powerful. It removes all obstacles,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:20.160
 obscurations, all that. But where is that love? Where is that boneless love?

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:30.800
 We cannot bring or touch. See, it's a pervasive quality with the nature of the mind.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 It's the nature of the mind, pervasive quality. Pervasive, it shines from the nature of the mind.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:48.240
 It is residing in the nature of the mind. It again comes from the nature of the mind.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:56.320
 Therefore, the nature of the mind has no boundaries, no deep.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:07.520
 It's boneless. Therefore, we can bring boneless love without exhorting our love.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:14.340
 As much as we're exhorting or punishing, or can't relate, lost the love. If we bring more loving-

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.200
kindness,

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:22.080
 we're going to decrease our love. No. Actually, it's increasing. It's increasing,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.960
 more powerful, because we discover from the infinite treasure of the mind.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:36.000
 Love, that is bodhicata, so the absolute bodhi. The nature of the relative bodhicata

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.920
 is the absolute true bodhicata. This time, we can't intellectually understand that

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.720
 emptiness, meaning of the emptiness. But with this emptiness, because with this understanding,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.800
 practice and meditate, then when we will see the nature of the absolute truth,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.000
 exactly as our bodhicata, absolute true bodhicata, when, according to Buddhism,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.040
 is the post-Bhoomi. The seeing part, you see the exactly absolute bodhicata.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:14.160
 This absolute bodhicata is actually same as Dzogchen teaching. Dzogchen teaching is an absolute

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:21.200
 bodhicata. Therefore, many times, Dzogchen teachings are named bodhicata teachings,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.560
 because it's an absolute bodhicata. It's the essence of the teaching, where this relative

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:36.960
 bodhicata arises from that absolute true bodhicata. But the absolute true bodhicata is, in a way,

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:47.440
 external, is the outreaching. We can categorize, we can explain, we can discuss, we can't do those

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:56.160
 things. The absolute true bodhicata is beyond the world, beyond the levels. And that's what

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.520
 great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said in the teaching, "Unborn, unseasoned." Nature is like sky.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.800
 If we use this kind of like, commonly what we see, kind of we can adjust it in this world,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:19.840
 can tell all that sky. Absolute bodhicata is like sky. But the sky was the sky.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:26.080
 This blue color, we see, according to Buddhism, is not the sky. That is the color.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:37.040
 This is not the sky. This is sky. This space, this openness is sky. This has no boundaries.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:47.440
 Also, when we see, when we say, we say, "Oh, I saw sky." But reality, what we saw, what we see now,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:55.760
 for example, sky, we can say maybe this openness, this spaciousness. Otherwise, there's nothing we

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:05.120
 can really make the descriptions. That is absolute bodhicata. Absolute bodhicata is, now we know a

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:11.040
 little bit intellectually, intellectually, theoretically we understand them, but reality,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:18.560
 that actually this absolute bodhicata will shine to our mind and realize this mind when we reach

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:26.480
 the first booming in the teaching set, or the same path. That time, you see, exactly as it is,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:33.280
 without as intellectual, without any presumptions, without any tiru. Tiru, you see.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:42.800
 See that? That is absolute bodhicata. In order to bridge that realization, then we do this

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:53.600
 external, performant activity of the six paramatas. Six paramata practice is absolutely best upon

00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:06.160
 poor, boneless love, joy, compassion, joy, and equanimities. With that, then each nature,

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:17.440
 six paramata, nature of the generous paramata is sharing, is giving, giving to the others

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:26.640
 without grasping, without clinging. Whatever you give, we give with joy, with appreciation,

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:33.680
 with good heart, with the bodhicata, poor, boneless thoughts. That is the generosity practices.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:42.160
 Whether it is small, whether it is big, whatever it is, with good heart. That is called virtues.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.240
 And what a great teacher, a Buddha, Shakyamuni, said in teaching,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:54.560
 generous practice with open heart without any expectations, and give that to the others.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.800
 That is generosity. Then generous practice, generosity has many divisions. Of course,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.440
 you know, maybe we won't go those things, but generosity. And really those are

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:12.880
 material generosity practices and protection generosity practices and words of wisdom

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.570
 generosity practices. Those are the three generosity practices, which it says also, many others,

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.120
 but

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:25.360
 reality generosity is open heart, sharing, and giving to the others with the compassion,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.400
 with the bond, poor boneless thought, with the love. That generosity is so powerful,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.400
 so special in the teachings. And you can also dedicate that merit for all the living beings,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:44.480
 really the brain, by this generosity. What in the teaching said, by this generosity,

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.480
 may I liberate all the living beings who are not ever liberated by the precious Buddhas,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.760
 prayers by this generosity. The teaching says that. That is praise. You can really doing this,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.440
 something we're performing, very beautiful activities. And then second is the moralities,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:12.160
 parameters. And morality is the essence and nature of the morality is like to be pure at

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:20.080
 purity thought or attitude is the moralities. Like to be pure, keep pure, pure of the body,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:29.360
 pure of the speech, pure of the mind, that attitude, or like to be a clear way, clear way,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:35.840
 negative videos. I like clear with the body negative videos, speaking negative videos,

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:41.680
 mental negative videos. I like to clear ways. Can having that attitude, I don't like to be

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:48.480
 associated with the negative video and keep that with my body, my speech, my mind. Having that

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:57.280
 thought is the pure, the essence of morality, essence of morality. With that, then following

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:04.320
 the old instructions of the Buddha teachings, there's many instructions for the instructions

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.680
 of morality for the lay practitioners as well as ordained practitioners, many levels. Those are all

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:21.120
 known as morality practices. Morality practice or morality parameters. The next one is the patience

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.280
.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:31.440
 Patience is what? Nature of the patience is commitment to upkeeping the body.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.600
 That is that. So that means your commitment and your our courage.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.160
 Courageous. Or sometimes in the teaching, it says never mind attitudes.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:52.800
 Having the attitude of never mind. I'm going to maintain that. But that means, never mind means

00:38:52.800 --> 00:39:00.640
 if someone, the patient, when we practice, you know, lose patience, when we are in what's called

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:10.720
 encountering, in contrary with external activities or the disturbance activities, that time we lose

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:20.720
 our patience. So for that reason, I would say never mind. Have the attitude of never mind.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:30.560
 So that means when I say never mind, what that indicating in the deep immediately, that shows

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.960
 the proof or that proves that individual is courage and commitment is so strong.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:46.920
 That is not going to disturb their identity of the body together. Keeping up courage and commitment

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.040
.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:56.160
 Commitment. Never mind. Like that. That's really the essence of the patience.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:07.120
 And then patience to the external challenges. Patience to the inner emotionals. Inner emotionals.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.120
 And patience to the practice dharmas. Practice dharmas. Those are all in the teaching. So always

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:22.720
 have the strong confidence, courage and commitment. Upkeeping the practices. Practice. So that is

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:32.560
 patient practices. Brilliant. And next one is the port paramattam, which is joyful effort

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:40.000
 for the virtues I translated. Why? Before I used to translate it, joyful effort.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.800
 Effort. But now I added it to myself, self-virtues. So many times, because of what the

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:56.800
 greater master, Shanti Deva said in his teaching, what is joyful effort? Joyful effort is the one

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:06.240
 who has joy to the virtues. That's what he said. Joy to the virtues. So that means that also when

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:12.480
 you say the joy to the virtues, that is joyful effort in this bodhicata. But if you have the joy

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:20.400
 to do some different activities, that is not the joyful effort of the paramattam or bodhicata

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:26.320
 paramattam, because maybe you're inspired doing something, something that maybe not really

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:33.440
 lined up with bodhicata. You can't regular activate your joy or your, I'm keen, I'm hobby,

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.240
 I'm doing this and that things. People do so many different things because they are joy.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.760
 They can't be happy with doing that. Just feel happy with that, don't you think? Maybe that

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.360
 is not lined up with us helping to the others. Maybe, or somebody even maybe hurting some others.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:58.640
 For order to cut that and then make the purely as it is so joyful effort to the virtues.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:06.560
 As great master Shanti Deva said, the effort, joyful effort is, the nature of joyful effort is

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:19.360
 joyful to the virtues. So joyful effort is then that is joyful effort for all the practices,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:25.760
 meditations, really just that. And also that means we have joyful effort, we are not under the

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.240
 power

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.960
 of the laziness. It's directly opposite of the laziness. Laziness, or there's also laziness,

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:39.280
 it's not just a kind of casual laziness, just to kind of like become as a piece of logs,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:46.720
 or a G kind of log. That is not just only. There is also laziness in Buddhism. According to

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.520
 teaching,

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.480
 laziness of something more kind of like, it's attracted with doing some kind of unwholesome

00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:05.280
 or unnecessary wasted times. Wasted times. Sometimes I saw in one poem on the wall, his poem,

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:15.840
 and eating the popcorn and sitting on the sofa as a refrigerator and watching the televisions.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:28.560
 So sitting on the sofa, watching the television, eating the, sitting on the sofa as a refrigerator,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.440
 eating the popcorn, watching the television. I thought this is also, also I thought this,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:41.120
 according to Buddhism, it's maybe later laziness. Laziness, you just don't like to do anything,

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:48.330
 just like, that's it. Really, drinking those popcorn or whatever, which is good, is wonderful,

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:48.560
 really.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.240
 Very good. But however, however it is, I mean, it's just really has nothing,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:00.720
 anything, just kind of like that. Then time is according to Buddhism, I mean, it's true,

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:07.920
 not just Buddhism. We look carefully, time is so precious. And if time is really on the our side,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.600
 when everything is good and our capable to do something good, is really good to do. I'm not

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:20.400
 kidding your time. Therefore, joy and appreciation. When every time everything is on our side,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:27.360
 how fortunate, how grateful. That is called golden opportunities. Golden opportunities are not just

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.800
 coming gold. Golden opportunities, when we have the everything is on our side and we have the

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.800
 freedom and the capability to activate it. During that action, action, fulfilling that, that is the

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.800
 golden opportunity you're really fulfilling. It's so wonderful, so special, and which is also in

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:44.880
 the

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:51.360
 Buddhism called, we're making the meaning for our own spiritual lives, making life something

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:51.920
 spiritual.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.200
 We are really developing, building something special to our heart and mind,

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.480
 not external maybe, but from to the heart and mind. According to teaching, teaching, whatever

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:11.440
 we're able to progress, develop with mind, that will go with us when we leave this world.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:18.560
 Whatever we do something externally, even those great monument that has merit, that will go with

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:26.160
 us, but otherwise everything stays out. There's no one that can take, but what things we develop

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:35.760
 with our heart and mind, according to teaching, that will come with us. So then that means we're

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:44.400
 really also making something special trail, trail for our future destinations beyond what we see

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.200
 now.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:52.000
 Really, all will be good. So that means then everything becomes more comfortable, nice,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.280
 more uplifting. We leave this world with joy and peace, happiness, and we're kind of thankful,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.560
 and that will stretch all the way according to Buddhism to the next lives. That all is

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.200
 usually the time right way, and making it meaningful of these our spiritual lives.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:18.320
 Life is just a short time, but our mind is, according to teaching, it's not going to end,

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:27.040
 it's not going to stop, it will be continued. So well, everything is in our sight, and use the time

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:27.040
,

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:34.000
 and make that something meaningful. It's joyful effort, joyful efforts.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.120
 With that, and then next one is the next paramata, is the Deon paramata or concentrations.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:54.240
 The essence and nature of the concentration is not distracted, not distracted. That is essence,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:02.960
 not distracted. So that means not distracted our mind. We need our mind distracted, our

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:09.200
 verbals are distracted. Our verbals are distracted, maybe physically distracted. Then we're not

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:09.520
 able

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:17.200
 to settle ourselves. Concentration means particularly is designed teaching on the mind,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:25.680
 or to our mind. Our concentrations have to be settled. Mind is what? Present time is distracted.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:33.280
 All different memories, past memories, present memories, or past memories, present plans,

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.040
 in future plans, in future projections, so many things, there's so many things are really

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.520
 completely

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:47.680
 distracted. That is not the concentration, it's scattered, scattered mind. But concentration means

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:56.480
 one point is single state, mind began to rest. It is own status, whether it is

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.960
 chamad meditation or vibhayana meditation, not distracted. Chamad meditation means coming down

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:12.400
 our own conceptual thoughts to the one single state. One thought rests now.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.360
 So that means we're not following the old thoughts,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:26.400
 thinkings, that is concentration. And then vibhayana is zokkin meditation. Seeing the nature of the

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:26.800
 mind,

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:36.880
 beholding the nature of the openness of the mind or the rukwa, rukwa or the

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:47.120
 absolute truth or absolute bodhicata, and relaxing that status freely and openly and very freshly.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:58.720
 That is known as zokkin meditation or relaxing. That is dhyan, dhyan or concentration paramata,

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:06.400
 so that essence of it is not distracted. And the next one is, is then pandya paramata.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:14.320
 Pandya paramata is, pandya means wisdom. Wisdom is knowing the exactly way things are,

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.920
 is wisdom. That means what? Knowing the exactly way things are related truth or relative level,

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:28.720
 knowing the exactly way the absolute truth or knowing exactly entity of the related truth

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:38.160
 as it is. That means not overstated, not understated, not made anything, just the ways. See,

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.000
 that means see simple truth as it is. See the truth as it is. That is wisdom.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.840
 In Buddhism, that is really the biggest wisdom, the most powerful wisdom, not making up things

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:58.720
 as it is. As it is the way on the relative level, as it is on the absolute level as

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:06.160
 that and seeing that as it is, that is. And then wisdom can be divided,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:13.680
 teaching that wisdom that comes from the starting, wisdom that comes from the concentrations,

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:21.200
 wisdom that comes from the meditation and the practices. All wisdom of the relative truth,

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:29.840
 of the wisdom of the absolute truth. But basically seeing as it is, seeing the truth as is a symbol

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:29.840
,

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.440
 that is the absolute truth. That is the wisdom. Those are the wisdom of the paramata. And the

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:43.920
 paramata means what? Again, we added that generosity of the paramata, morality of the paramata,

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:51.280
 everything we added paramata. That is generally, paramata makes those generously more special.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.960
 Same as generally, again, these six paramata, we all have. It's not just the

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:10.560
 unique of the Buddhism. Everyone has, every world has these six. Every world or every religion

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:17.120
 explains that. Generosities, moralities, impatience and all that. But paramata

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:27.120
 means no grasping, no clinging, no attachment. No attachment, when we are proposing this

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:32.800
 performance of the generosity, no attachment. When you're proposing the morality activity,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:40.160
 no attachment, no grasping and patience, joyful effort to the virtues and concentrate,

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:48.480
 no attachment, no grasping, no clinging. And some teaching on the teaching said,

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:57.680
 no grasping, clinging to the subject, the object, the actions, no clinging. Open, free and very,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:06.080
 very vastness nature, that makes the paramata. And that is paramata in Sanskrit what it truly means

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.080
,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:16.800
 one which takes to the other shore, other side of the shore, S-H-O-R-E, I believe, other shore.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:24.960
 That means this paramata with no attachment, no grasping, clinging, will take the other shore

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:31.760
 of the enlightenment. This is the samsara shore, where we are now. It's a samsara shore. From this

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:38.000
 shore, it will attract to the other shore of the enlightenment, brotherhood or the Nirvana.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:50.320
 Mahaparin, the Nirvana states. So that is known as paramata, sixth paramata. That will maintain

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.940
 the bodhicitta as well as increase in the bodhicitta. It will bring the progression of the bodhic

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.440
itta.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.800
 That will bring here, great master, Jayabhji Dune, which is benefiting others.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:12.480
 Benefiting others is benefiting others with the six paramatas. Paramatas, then that is activity

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:19.600
 of the conqueror's son and daughter. Here it translates as "upsprings." But conquerors,

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:27.600
 symbols, you say, conqueror's son and daughters. That means, in the teachings said, as I said

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:34.320
 earlier, in the great master Shanti Devas, the moment we develop the bodhicitta in our heart,

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:41.520
 that moment, our name will be changed forever. What is known as bodhisattvas,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:48.240
 bodhisattva of male and bodhisattva of females. Bodhisattva of male and female,

00:53:48.240 --> 00:54:02.560
 also a name I sometimes say, conqueror is the name of the Buddha. Conqueror. What conquered?

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:11.440
 Conquered all the obstacles, obscurations, negative emotions, ego clings, all the knowledge

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:18.080
 obscurations, and emotion obscurations. I may be making those other day and you know already.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:27.280
 So, Buddha conquered that, means defeated that. Buddha defeated ego clings, Buddha defeated the

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:35.860
 negative emotions, anger, jealous, heavy thoughts, angry, and arrogance, and ignorance, those

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.880
 defeated,

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:44.960
 those really so, Buddha defeated two major obstacles, obscurations. Obscuration of knowledge,

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:51.680
 obscurations of the emotions have defeated. Then one who follow in the Buddha's path,

00:54:51.680 --> 00:55:04.960
 and upholding that lineage is known as noble son and noble daughters. Why they named? Because

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.680
 this noble son and daughters are generally what in the world, sons of what they say,

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:18.320
 sons are keeping the client of the, of the families. This is right. In this case,

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:24.560
 the noble son and noble daughters are keeping the client of the Buddhas. What is the client

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:30.880
 of the Buddha? It's bodhicata. Bodhicata is a client. You're keeping, upkeeping that client,

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:40.000
 or that, that, that cost. Cost. And then what the bodhisattva was doing, also helping to the others

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:40.000
,

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:47.520
 that Buddha does. So the Buddha was keeping up the client of the bodhicata, and helping to the

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.160
 other,

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.880
 the Buddha loved to all the beings. And now bodhisattva, noble son and noble daughters,

00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:00.560
 or the prince and the princess of the bodhisattvas, victorious ones, are continually performing,

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:07.360
 engaging that activity, and upholding the Buddha's legacy and visions. Therefore,

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:16.320
 this conqueror's offspring. They are the holder of the Buddha's client and lineage, teaching,

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:22.240
 and his, and the Buddha's vision, in a way. So that is what,

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:35.840
 so that is really about bodhicata, okay, bodhicata. And then that is the foundation here,

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.640
 a quote, I mean she's on the gentleman's head, and I mentioned you all know that. That's really

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.200
 the foundation of generally all the Buddha teachers. Buddha teaching is generally the best

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:52.000
 of love and compassion, and non-violence. That, you know, doesn't matter which school, basic school

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.000
,

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.080
 or the bodhisattva yanas, and everything is the same, that. But then in the bodhisattva yana,

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:04.000
 or the Mahayana, highlight it, the kind of more emphasizing on the loving kindness, the compassion,

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.920
 for all the beings, and for that reason, you're going to get enlightenment, or walking for the

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:16.560
 enlightenment. That is emphasized, and that's why it's called Mahayana, big weaker, great weaker.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.840
 So that is my brief talk, and thank you very much everyone, okay, thank you, thank you very much

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:37.440
 everyone, thank you, thank you. Now again we do short dedication, it's here.

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.600
 By this merit, may all obtain omniscience, may it defeat any wrong drawing, from the

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.880
 stormy waves of the birth, or the sickness, and death, from the ocean of the samsara,

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.680
 may I pray for all beings, may the soul, soul, soul, and the benefit of happiness,

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:09.200
 the Buddha's teachings remain for a long time. May the birth to the banner of the lives of the

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:15.440
 noble ones, from the whole level of the teachings remain firm. May all the sentient beings always

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.760
 be joyful, may all births into the lower realms cease forever. May the wishes of all the holy

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:28.000
 Sufas and all of whom we swiftly reach for wishes, at this very moment for the peoples and nations

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:28.160
 of

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:34.240
 the earth, may not even the names of disease, famine, war, and suffering be heard, but rather

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:40.240
 make pure conduct, flair, wealth, and prosperity increase, and may supreme good fortune and

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:47.600
 well-being always arise. The precious bodhicitta and those without it may be generated, and those

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:54.160
 who have it may never diminish, but always continue increasing. May the great tradition of kenpo

00:58:54.160 --> 00:59:01.040
 shamtara kshita, lopan havasnabha, and the Dharma King Tristan that's increased and spread

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.440
 throughout

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:07.040
 the three realm world. May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind's streams of beings

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.520
 remain inseparable and embrace the long well-being throughout the three times.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:17.600
 See it in mantra and dharmakaya, how the nature of appearance, sound, and awareness,

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:24.000
 the pervasive kaya and the wisdom display of the buddhas, may practitioners of the profoundness

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:38.800
 see great perfection remain inseparable from the innermost one taste awareness of wisdom mind.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.600
 Thank you again. Thank you very much for participating. If you have time please,

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:52.960
 then we do target with the vegakalaya and dharmakala, dharmapala practice. Okay. Thank you.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.400
 Otherwise, then hopefully see you at the

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.720
 after tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much everyone.
