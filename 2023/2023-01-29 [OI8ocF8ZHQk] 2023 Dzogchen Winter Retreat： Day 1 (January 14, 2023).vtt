Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you again. Thank you very much everyone for participating. Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 I said quite a few times. Thank you. Thank you very much again.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 Now, we're going to again go through the teachings of our gracious teacher, Bodhakhyakya Muni and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 Guru Padmasambha,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 all those lineage masters who taught first-time gracious teacher, Bodhakhyakya Muni,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 and then continually carried by so many great practitioners, what we call great masters.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 They continually carried. So they are the Sangha members.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Sangha members continually carried these precious teachings of non-violence, peaceful,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 harmony, respect, and appreciation, and discovering our one's own and its beautiful nature,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 and also helping support to others to discover their innate natures.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 That's what we're going to again continue. You all know, already received so many teachings

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 from many great masters, and you already practiced it, but somehow this is what we're doing today.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 It will be reactivated, restented, reminded of our practice in meditation,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.210
 where we are studying, where we are going, and what is our destination of this spiritual or the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.000
 practice journey.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 So that's what really we do, doing according, my capabilities, and then some degree, it's support.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So I wish. And again, to do this, to start with the practice in the teachings,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 always so important to recollect our intention, or glorifying our beautiful,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 sleeping, beautiful motivation, we have to wake up that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 We have beautiful motivation, beautiful intention in our heart and mind,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 but many times it's in the sleeping mood.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So that, when you're sleeping, then that's the sleeping siesta or whatever it is.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 So we have to really activate it. We have to bring that alert and freshness to it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Every day we have to fresh it, not just a month and a while, in a month and a week or something.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Really, according to the teaching, we have to activate and refresh it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 This motivation is so, glorious motivation, so important, so necessary.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.030
 All our practice, all our realization, all our fulfillment are absolutely best upon our one's own

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 motivation.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And who controls our motivation? Nobody else controls our own motivation.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Each of us has 100% one responsibility and capability to activate it and to redirect that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 If we don't redirect that, then what is? That's called samsara.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Then we are continually heading to the samsara, all these difficult challenges.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.560
 But this time, according to the gracious teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Manu's teaching and the lineage

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 teaching,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 we're trying to make some difference in our own, these precious lives when we are here.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Right now, really, right this lifetime, we like to make something, some fulfillment, some degree,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 that we can enjoy ourselves and we can also, at the same time, inhabit ourselves

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 and also, somebody, so our families, friends and neighbors, others, also make something really

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 happy,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 particularly those who are kind of a little bit relying or we are connected and we can do.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 That is what we call in Dharma, we are making the meaning for our lives.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.860
 That is really meaningful. That is common, that is ground, that is practical, that is very sensible

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.000
.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 It's really sensible and practical. It is so powerful. That's it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So the order to do that is our motivation.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.950
 And of course, always the great masters, when they give teaching, always said, "Recorrect the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.000
 motivation."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.750
 That is always, because it's so important. Important. It's not just, "I'm saying that," it's common

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.000
.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Every time when they give sessions, teachers say, "Correct the motivation."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 We already know, we are practicing, we received the teaching and we heard that,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 but it's not just on the memory banks or somewhere else, but really activating is so, so important.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And this time, activation of the motivation is joy and appreciation first.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Feel happy and joy, ourselves. We have every right and every opportunity.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 It's not just making up the stories. You ask yourself or each of us,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 ask ourselves. Ask me and ask, "I'm going to ask myself," and also you ask yourself.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 We have every reason to feel happy and joy, beautiful things.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And the spiritual level or dharma level, as well as samsara world level, we are quite well-occupied

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Really, every aspect, we have to glorify, happy, joy.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 That is dharma, called Buddhism. It's not something that we are making details, happy and joy,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 but also have the same time, courage and commitment to continue to activate it, glorify that.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Along with that, there is a vastness, motivation of the bodhicitta.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Of course, we also heard so many times, "I heard, you heard this bodhicitta."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But it's not just heard intellectually, no, kind of in a way, a memory state.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Activating. Activating, that is so important. Bodhicitta is.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 The essence of bodhicitta is compassion. That we know.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Poor, boneless. Among that, many times in the teachings,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.800
 with the boneless of loving-kindness, boneless of compassion, come down on the front of the bodhic

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.000
itta.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Really, from the core of our heart, or the bottom of our heart.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Activating that. Have that bodhicitta, thinking of all living beings.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 That, thinking of all living beings, is bodhicitta. That is bodhicitta.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Everybody has some degree of compassion and loving-kindness,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 but everyone is not thinking of all living beings.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Mahayana or the bodhicitta, thinking of all living beings,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 even as you all know, we heard that, they put front of all the beings than ourselves.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 They are the front of us, in a way. Or they are more important than us.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 God in the teachings said, we've been continually, for a long time,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 being a self-important, self-centered mind, our self.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 That didn't really work at all.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 We continually went in the samsara, even more deeper in the samsara.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Samsara of the world, of duology, challenges, difficulties,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 disadvantages, uncomfortable, comfort. And nothing is correct. Nothing is right.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 That's all happening, one after another.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 No matter whatever we are surrounded, even the luxury of the lab,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 sitting in the luxury of the lab, still it's not enough.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Still it's not correct. That's really what we are.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 I'm not saying that street people, but we all have that duty,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 and more we want. More we have, more we want.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And that goes on and on, on and on, until our last breath.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Maybe we have that. Then there's nothing to do.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 We go with disappointment, some duty, unfulfillment.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 But instead, activate joy and appreciation, love and compassion.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Really we become rich, our self, rich in content, joy,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 and appreciate all those beautiful things come up, up.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So therefore, this bodhi, the vastness in the teaching said vastness, motivation,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 vastness, the motivation of thinking of all living beings,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 beings that I'm going to practice, I'm going to meditate,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 what all my activities of the bodhi, speech, and mind,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 may they become as one of the great support and help

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 to bring the joy, peace, happiness for all living beings,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 for mankind, for the animals, to every living beings.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 That we see, we don't see. And that we know or we don't know.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 But there's so many people are, beings are struggling.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Really we can get into your thought that is essence, heart,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 the central column of the Mahayana practices or the central column

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 of the Buddha's teaching, the greatest teacher, the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And that, not just the Buddha said, that echoed by all those great practitioners

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 or great masters, continue one after another.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And since we are the follower of those great masters

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 and those great beings, also we should activate that.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 It really makes sense. It's meaningful.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 It makes a happy and joy and a performance.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And it's all good with that.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And then we have the way, the schedule means the motivations.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Those are in the teaching said, very honest,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 reality level, everything is enlightened status,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 or everything is enlightened, or where things are as it is.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Where things are as it is, everything is enlightened.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Everything is in a divine, mental status.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 But why we don't see this? Because due to the duality,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 duality as a cataract of our eyes, we don't perceive things.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 We are things out.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So therefore, even though we are in the midst of the duality,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 we try to activate it about the origin of quality.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 We are seeing everything as divine, mental, or three wagers status,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 or the three kaya status, and three wagers.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Wager poems, all the poems are enlightened.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Wager means what? Actually, indestructible.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Indestructible in this realm, what means?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 This cannot be changed.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Nature of the poem is enlightened.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 It cannot change any circumstances.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Reality, that is fact.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Fact cannot be changed, destroyed.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 It's like a wager.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Whether we recognize that, whether we don't recognize,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 fact is fact.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 It's enlightened. It's a purity status.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And sound is a wager status.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 It's a mantra, divine sound, love and compassion,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 soothing, and all the wager teachings, all the teachings.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 That is, again, whether we recognize, not,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 it's that is the fact.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Therefore, it's called, cannot be unbreakable, like wagers.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 And mind is enlightened.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 That is also wager mind and wager space,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 all these enlightened status.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 And the zoki teachings, it's three kaya status,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 three kayas, poems are the nirmakayas,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 sounds are the dharmakaya,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 and mind is the,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 poems are the nirmakayas,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 sounds are the sambhokaya.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I'm sorry, maybe I mixed up there.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 But mind is a dharmakaya status.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 It's originally enlightened.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 It's not something newly we are developing

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 through the process of the practice of meditation,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 a kora teaching.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 And through the process of the meditation practice,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 that is then become the compounded.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Compounded is temporary.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 You develop it by the cause and condition,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 develop it, then it can change.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Nature cannot change.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Therefore, it's called wager, as it is.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 The enlightenment is already discovering.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Of course, in the zoki teachings said,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 and you all know, is the discovering

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 of our inner nature,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 matter, midst of the duality.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 We clear away the duality and discovery of the ordinal,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 that completely fully awakened qualities.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 That is a wager,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 discovering ordinal state of the three kayas.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 So those are really,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 even though we don't have realization right this moment,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 but trying to kind of bring up those,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 at least open the door toward their directions,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 is very important.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And of course, this kind of way,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 and in a way, is an intellectual way.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 We are just covering and connecting that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 But that intellectual, according to the teaching,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 it is lined up with the true nature.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 It's not false.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 We are making the progress.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 We open the door of the reality of the true natures.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Those understand.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 And now, we go to this sadhana,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 or sorry, a sadhana,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 or the practices or the teachings.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 This is, again, of course,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 this is, here,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 a short discourses,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 a course on the view, meditation, and conduct.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So that is what I'm trying to go over this,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 slowly by slowly,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 and then kind of like discovering some degree of the teachings

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And some of them, they need a master's.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 So that's what we are doing.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And again, to do this, again,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 so we think, of course, we all know this.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 But always, it is important to trace the back

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 where we really come from,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 or where this teaching belongs or come from.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 This teaching comes from the greatest teacher,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 and who came, 2,600 years ago.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And Buddha is full of love,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 full of compassion, full of wisdom.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Understanding everything, exactly perfect,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 exactly as it is, without exaggeration,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 without understanding.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Exacty see things are written.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Those are known as the wisdom of the enlightenment.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 When you get enlightenment,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 or when you are enlightened,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 there is no blockage of the world

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 between reality and knowledge.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 See everything as it is.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So, then, Buddha gives detailed teachings of this.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 And also, Buddha gives, when he teaches,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Buddha knows exactly what to give the teachings.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 For example, the audience comes to the greatest teacher,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 to the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 and the teaching says,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Buddha immediately recognizes, sees,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 that person's intention,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 design and motivation,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 what they are interested in.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 A cold daily Buddha spoke,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 had discussions with them,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 and then the audience is full of happy and joy

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 and satisfaction with deep respect.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 "Wow!" to the Buddha says, "load the feet,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and left place with joy,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 and happy, and perform at all satisfaction."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Why?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Because Buddha knows exactly what is capability,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 what is necessary,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 what is important,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 what suits teaching to that individual.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 For that reason,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 when Buddha reached enlightenment age 35,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 he gave, since age 35,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 until he entered Mahabharata in Iran age 81 or 80,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 80 around that time,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 and Buddha gives the teachings

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 that according to capabilities,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 desires, motivation,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 and so they can apply, everyone.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 No one is turned back away,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 and everyone can follow the path.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 The path is to discover our own innate nature,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 our own or one's own nature.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 The path is not something alien,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 that is Buddha is told.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 The path is to discover our,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 or each of their innate nature,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 with love, with compassion,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 with non-violence.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 And therefore, there are many teachings.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 That's what Buddha's teachings are called,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 84,000 different topics of the teachings that Buddha gives.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Those teachings are named in the teachings,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 because why that many teachings?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Because our emotions,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 there are so many emotions,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 negative emotions.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Negative emotions,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 there are three principles of negative emotions,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 that we, of course, we have so many times.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 The ignorance, attachment, and anger.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Each of those, that is called,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 there are 21,000 related,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 principally connected emotions of the ignorance.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 21,000 of the emotions

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 related with attachment.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And 21,000 emotions

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 more connected with anger.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And 21,000 emotions

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 more connected to all combination,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 three of them together.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So for that reason, Buddha gives 84,000 teachings.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 85,000 teachings, and what in the teachings said,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 you said, or in the Dokki teachings said,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 in order to dispel the purified,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 the 21 negative, ignorant emotions,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Buddha gave 21,000 teachings

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 of the Abhidharma teachings.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And in order to dispel of the attachment,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 of the 21,000 emotions,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Buddha gave 21,000 different teachings

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 related with more Vinaya teachings.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 And in order to dispel all the subdue

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 of the 21,000 of the anger related,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 and Buddha gave 21,000 of the Sattara teachings.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 And in order to dispel all those negative emotions,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 three emotions, 21,000, Buddha gave 21,000

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 of the Varyana teachings.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 All together, 84,000 teachings.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Those are the teachings said.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 So now these all teachings,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 when you summarize, and what these teachings are,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 can be summarized into three,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 to simplify what is commonly known as

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 three basket teachings that we all heard.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 What are those three basket teachings?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Again, I just listed that, of course, you know all.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 And that is Vinaya basket teachings of the Vinaya,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 basket teachings of the Sattara, basket teachings of the Abhidhana.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 So three basket teachings.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Why is it called a basket?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Because a basket means that it's a treasure box.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 A treasure box has not just one piece,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 there is variety of treasure in that one treasure box.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So Vinaya basket has a variety of the jewels, treasures.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 What are again related with, again, with the conduct,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 with morality, with concentration, with resistance.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So there is jewels of the teachings

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 on the pacifically highlight of the morality teaching,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 pacifically highlight of the teachings of the concentrations,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 pacifically teachings highlight of the wisdom teachings

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 within the basket of the Vinaya.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Vinaya is generally named as like the conduct, the morality teaching, all.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 But within that has all those three trails.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And similarly, Sattara teaching has also that three.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 So it's called a basket, all that teaching.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Sattara has morality teaching, Sattara teaching.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Sattara has the concentration of teaching, Sattara has Abhidhana teachings,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 all the wisdom teachings.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 And Abhidhana teaching has all those same things,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 and has teachings of the morality, teachings of the concentrations,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 teachings of the wisdom.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 So that means essence of the three basket teachings comes to art.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 And it comes as true, what is in Buddhism called long chu, tok chu.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 The scriptural teaching and the practice teachings,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 or the realization of practice teaching,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 teaching of the practice, teaching of the scriptures.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 The scriptural teachers, all those suttas, what I said.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 But practice, what do you practice?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 The essence of that is practice.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 That is practice on the moralities,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 practice on the concentrations, practices on the wisdoms.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 These three are in Buddhism, many of you all know,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 three extraordinary training practices.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 What is train?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Train our body, train our mind,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 train our speech, voice,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 so it becomes more gentle,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 body becomes more gentle, peaceful,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 and more calming to ourselves or to the others,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 or pleasing to others and ourselves.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And the speech becomes more calmer, more peaceful,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 more gentle, more polite, more simple,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 more frank and simple.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And mind becomes also more calmer, more peaceful.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 You, with love and compassion,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 and not buddling with all different discursive,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 emotional thoughts, one after another,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 every different direction, it becomes calmer.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Therefore, it is called training to ourselves.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 By what?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Our one's own self.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 As we received the teaching, we will also activate that

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 about our practice.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 So in that context, this teaching,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 what we are going to show is the teaching is,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 again, among those, like, three basket teachings,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 this particular teaching is Vajrayana teaching.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And now maybe you're thinking Vajrayana teaching belongs where?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Vajrayana teaching belongs to the, again,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 in the three basket teachings.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Within the Vajrayana teaching, it has morality teaching,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 it has a concentrated teaching, it has wisdom teachings.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 And what are the morality teachings of the Vajrayana teachings?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Morality is all the Samayas.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Wow, those are the morality teachings.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 It's different names.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Morality maybe didn't make it all the time, but Samayas.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Samaya is guidance, guidelines of the core conduct.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Conduct our body, our verbal thought, verbal communication,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 as well as our mind, how our mind acts.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 So that is really, that is a Samaya.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 And concentrations or the Samadis of the Vajrayana teaching,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 such as then all the concentrated practice, meditation,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 sajid, sah, lung, tomo practices, all the visualization practices.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Those are highlights of concentration and Samadhi meditation.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 And what is then the wisdom practice of the Vajrayana teachings,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 as according to Dukhin, then Dukhin is the wisdom practices, teachings.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 It is directly connected with our own origin and nature,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 our own mind or discover our energy and nature.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 So that is known as the wisdom practice.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 So that means Vajrayana teaching is also within the categories

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 of the three baskets teaching.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Suttara, sorry, Vinaya of the Vajrayana, Vinaya teaching of the Vajrayana,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Suttara teaching of the Vajrayana, and Abhidharma teaching,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 teachings of the Vajrayanas.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Abhidharma teaching is a very high light that Dukhi teaching

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 is the Abhidharma teaching of the Vajrayana teaching,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 highlight that according to the Nirma schools of the Ved Buddhism.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 And then, of course, each again has all that.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 So those are generally understanding.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And now this teaching, this particular teaching,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 is taught by or taught by a great master

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 who came in the 19th century,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 or led 19th century and early 20th century, great master,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 known as I'm already here.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 I'm sure you, many of you already know this.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 And that is then, his name is known as Chichi Jatsab Pema Namjia, Chichi.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Chichi is the monastery in East Tibet, one of the famous Nirma monasteries

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 as well as meditation centers in East Tibet, known as Chichi monasteries.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Actually, in the Nirma schools,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 particularly more kind of in the mid 15th century or mid those centuries,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 there is then developed the kind of named six famous monasteries in Nirma monasteries,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 six famous monasteries, that kind of, I think,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 more activated around mid 15th century or six around that times.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Those are the two famous monasteries in the center of it,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 known as the Mendelung Monastery and Dojietak monasteries.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 These two monasteries are so famous because it has also academic studying

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 and the meditation center.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Why these two are important?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 To uphold the teaching of the Buddha is need studying and practices.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 So my hike and more particularly associated highlight of the studying

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 is academic study because Buddha teaching is not just the only kind of believing practices.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 You also always get analyzed and study, contemplating on those meanings.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 That's what great teacher Buddha Chagyamuni himself said,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 said that you should exam and investigate, not just only relying on my words.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Those are the teachings said and therefore since the Buddhist begins

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 from the 50th century, so all the time, then there has always been a study.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 That is a big one famous, like Nalanda Monastery University in India and then so forth.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 So that's what the teaching said and it is also a great master, Basu Bendu said.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 What is the teaching of the Buddha?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 He said the Buddha's teaching is sequential and practices.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 And how you uphold that practice is studying and practice.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 That will uphold Buddha teaching.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 So in that context, in a way, what we are doing now is in a way a little bit studying.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Kind of understand the brain, a little more understanding of that.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 That means we are upholding the teaching of the Buddha.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Once we know that and then we start to practice meditating,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 that means upholding the practice aspect of lineage.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.550
 That will bring the realization because the teaching itself is really explaining the nature of our

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.000
 mind.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 The nature of all these phenomena, when you see this, ultimately everything comes to the mind.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 So when you practice that, then you discover our energy and nature.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Nature, that upholds the Buddha teaching.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So for those context level, in Buddhism, all the monosters they have,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 particularly those bigger monosters they have, then this Shirda and Drupdas.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 So, for example, the Mendoza monastery has Shirda and Drupdas,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 not just only the Mendoza monosters.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Mendoza monosters has so many branch monosters, too, and Dorjeta monosters.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 So those are two famous monosters in the center of the temple,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 and each of those has so many branch monosters.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And in the Eastern Tibet, there are four famous monosters.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Those are known as Sichi monosters and Dzogchi monosters.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And then Khatuk monosters and Bayar monosters.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Those are four famous monosters.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And each of those has so many branch monosters.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 So famous.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Among those six monosters said, particularly Khatuk monosters

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 is one of the oldest monosters in Eastern Tibet.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And surely I think that is developed, I can't tell exactly that,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 but maybe around 11 centuries.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Around 11th century it developed.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 It's one of the big, really famous monosters that kept so strongly

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 of the lineage teachings of all the teachings,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 particularly Nyingma teaching, and particularly Nyingma teaching.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 There are three teachings in the center.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Anu Mahayoga teaching, Anu Yoga teaching, Ati Yoga teaching.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Those three teachings, particularly very much,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 they kept so strongly in that monosters.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 There are so many practitioners, so many academics,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 and the practitioners who have been practicing at that time.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 I mean, this is the story.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 They are practicing on the monosters, hermitage,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 and they got high realization.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 And they also actualized of the Thalang Tomo practices.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And in the afternoon, many of those exercise of the Thalang Tomo practice,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 the particular Thalang Tomo practice, they are flying in the sky.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 The villages, you say, "Oh, don't, with the horse,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 don't go up into that area, because these practitioners practice

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 and fly in the sky, that scares the horses."

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 So really, that was the story.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Very famous of all the lineage teachings, particularly Nyingma Kama teaching.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Thalang Tomo teaching, and the Kama teaching,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 and particularly Kama teaching, is so famous,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 and therefore it was named Katho Monosters,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 particularly Katho Dorji Dhi.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 That means Dorji Dhi is the Buddha guy's name.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 So this Katho monastery is like as Dorji Dhi,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 or the Buddha guy, where so many enlightments are booming up,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 coming up that, that's what's it.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 So among those six monasteries,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 this Shishi monastery is one of the very famous monasteries,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 where there's so many great masters came, one after another.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 That's that.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 And even those in the teaching said,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 for example, this past chintse, past the kontro,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 and the papal rumbuji, they all started in the Shishi monastery,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 one of the great masters.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Masters, Shishi Pandita is a very famous master.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 So he was really very famous.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Among that, Shishi Jarsap is like continually a region of the Shichin,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 that means Shichin, there's three famous lamas,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 and among that, the first one is the head of the Shichi monastery,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 is Shichi Ramjan Rambojes, which is now still very active in India, in Bhutan.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 And the second is the Shichi Jarsap.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Shichi Jarsap, this particular Shichi Jarsap,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 become very famous, really famous.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 He was born, I think, 1781 in Eastern Tibet,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 and his father's name is known as Shira,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and the mother's name was known as Nakadoma.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 He belongs with officials, something.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 But anyway, he was recognized by the post-great chintse, great chintse.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 When the former Shichi Jarsap was passed away,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 he was a very good practitioner, a really good practitioner.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 He was known as Ramjang Doji, I think.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Ramjang Doji, when he was going to pass,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 he even mentioned, "I'm going to come back."

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Now he said, "My body has become very old and very unkind of people,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 and I think it's just better to leave this body

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 and be back as young child with good health that I like to come back."

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 So he mentioned it, and with those said,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 and then he entered Mahaparinarana, and when he entered,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 and then those students asked where his reincarnations,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 particularly to post-great chintse,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 and then very famous zoki master, head of zoki monastery,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 also known as zoki manjor nanko doji, is very famous, really, zoki master.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 So they asked two of them, and they both identified the same child,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 and particularly Shichi post-chintse, and then he enthroned.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 He enthroned as a Shichi monastery, and then he started practicing,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 and particularly, really, he started with so many great masters

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 and he received teachings from the post-chintse, post-chintse,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 post-chintse, and as well as many kaju lamas.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 I mean, at that time, the Buddhism, what we call now a rimi movement,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 is really started by the post-great chintse and post-chintse.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 They become the master of the rimi movement.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 That whole Buddhism, golden kind era of the Buddhism,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 arise, rose again at that time.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Really, so harmonious and peaceful.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Everybody is practicing and meditating,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 yet they just respect and appreciate everyone,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 and they become so blended.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 And so this great master, one of the most great in the F.A.C.,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 rimi practitioners from the new master schools of the Buddhism,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 and he started with post-chintse, post-chintse, post-chintse,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 post-chintse, post-chintse, and the great master Maharambhujis,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 and he become the heart students, all those great masters.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 And then as Kimbo Prakhi Oza and Sarminde Trungvarambhujidar,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 who is a former Sarminde Trungvarambhujidar,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 who came of this country, the privilege, that one.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 And so he received so many teachings.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Those are just highlighted, so many.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 And the teachings, the practice,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 he become the master of all the teachings,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 and then he meditated in the practice.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 He got high realization.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 And the scholar, he also wrote,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 I think more than 15 volumes of books and teachings,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 and his foremost disciples are his Holiness Tingon Chintse Rambhujidar

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 and Shiching Kuntros, and as well as so many,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 really, Lamas, those so many great masters

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 from what Kaju and as well as Nirma schools have become.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 So he's a disciple.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 So this is the one, Shiching Jartar Rambhujidar,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 commonly known as Shiching Jarsab,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 and then his full name is Yurmi Efema Namjars.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 So that is how this Yurmi Efema Namjars is.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 And now we go over this little bit of this,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 that this teaching, of course, again,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 always the teaching is divided into three groups.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 When you go through these teachings,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 always that's how in the teaching

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 all of those great master explained.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 So I try to go follow with those instructions

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 and read as much as I can.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Now, in this way, on this teaching

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 is divided into those two groups,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 the title and the text itself and the colophones.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 So those are the three, three kandos of positive divisions.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 And the first is now the title.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 The title is, then we already read,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 is in Tibetan, the Tagoonjoba, Tagoonjoba.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 So, will, meditation and conduct,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 that is explained in this here.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Now, if I can summarize this Tagoonjoba,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 what is this teaching?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 Again, as I said earlier, earlier,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 this is the three extraordinary training practices.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Three, what are those?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Those are morality, concentration,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 and the Muslims.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Muslims, which are which, if it's a strongness,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 that conduct is morality teachings,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 teachings on the moralities.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And meditation is concentration, samadhis.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 And then, wu is wisdom.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 So this is teachings on the morality,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 teachings on the meditation,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 teachings on the wisdom, have that way,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 have that understanding.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 And now, I mean, another way,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 I mean, that is really the principle grounds.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Now, everything of the wu,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 what is really wu?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 And again, this teaching, this title explaining,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 explaining the essence, condense the meaning

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 of the entire of these teachings.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Entire of this teaching.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 So title is a summary of the teachings.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 So it captures the principle meaning of the entire.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 And now, this first begins with wu,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 and then meditation, and then conduct.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Now, wu, generally, wu means what?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 In a way, it is object.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Wu is object. And what means? That means,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 because we are going to wu in the wu.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 Wu in the wu.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 That means wu-ing.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 The wu, that means wu-ing can maybe,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 I mean, you know maybe better,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 but means that's something that you're going to look.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 To what you're going to look? To the wu.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 You're going to look to the wu.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 That I think you also said, I'm wu-ing.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 When you say I'm wu-ing, that means there's something to wu.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 Wu.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 So now you're going to wu-ing.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 It's maybe not easy for me to pronounce that,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 but you're wu-ing the wu.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Somebody told me that you're doing,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 the way you're saying that, you're saying wu.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Wu and wu.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 So either way, I hope you understand what I'm talking.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 So that's the principle.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 And you're wu-ing now.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 But this time, what are you wu-ing?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 This time, you're wu-ing the nature.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Not artificial.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 You're really wu-ing the nature, exactly as it is.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 And this, if we could talk a little larger level in the nyungma teaching,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 the great master Mohan Rambhaji also said,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 I mean it's a nyungma teaching.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Wu of the object, wu-

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 or wu of the object maybe, wu of the object as it is,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 wu of the nature of the object,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 and wu of the one's own awareness.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 So there is three wu in a way.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 This is more kind of like a larger level, wu is that.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Wu of the object, wu of the object of the nature as it is.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 That is, in the vedayana teaching, particularly, for example,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 in a tantra teaching,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 that all objects are enlightened.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 All objects are enlightened.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 And that is a suggestion in Gohengarbha teachings.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 All the elements are five female Buddhas.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 And all the five aggregators are five male Buddhas.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 And what are those elements, for example,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 or maybe, let's say, with the five aggregators.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Poem is Buddha Verochanas.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 And our poem and feeling is Renasambhavas.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 Feeling aggregators.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Perception aggregate is Buddha Amitabha, feminist.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 And conception aggregate is Buddha among Sadas.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 And then, consciousness aggregate is Buddha Vayasambhavas.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 It is already enlightened.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 And all the, these five elements are already enlightened.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 It's not just all enlightened.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 All are is enlightened.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 And the earth is Sangyechema.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 And I think Sanskrit is Buddha Lhochanam.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 I don't know if that will help you or anything.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 But it is.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Earth is enlightened.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 Buddha Lhochanas.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 And sasaksho.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 And water is enlightened, mother.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 Mother mamakis.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 And the fire is enlightened.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Mother kukkarmun.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 In it a bit.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 All white robes.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 And wind is already enlightened.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 It's known as tamsakdroma.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 I think Sanskrit, Samaya, Taras, already enlightened.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 Sky is already enlightened.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 It is known as Vayar dhatu shorim.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 O dor jayun soma.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 So that means all these five aggregates,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 five dyan is already enlightened.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 You know, enlightened is already.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 It's not something newly developing, enlightened.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Or the discovery something.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Or we are developing that enlightenment.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I'm sorry, I shouldn't say discover.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 It's not we are developing that.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 It is already enlightened.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 We discover by the practices, meditations.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 We discover.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 So that means the object is enlightened,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 subject is enlightened.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 All is enlightened status.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 That is really reality, nature, according to teaching.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 It's not something that we really develop.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 So that means that is like what?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Seeing object, nature of the object as it is.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 The world that's seeing the object as it is.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 Object as is, as enlightened.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Then seeing the nature of object as it is.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Nature of that object is what?

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 It's all emptiness.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Emptiness.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 There's no substantially solid, conquered objects.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 All emptiness.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 So that means art is enlightened.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Art is very emptiness.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 Fire is the emptiness.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Wind is the emptiness.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 And the earth is the emptiness.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 It's the emptiness.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 There's no substantial solid existing.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 So seeing nature exactly as it is.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 And then as well as our form, feeling,

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 as well as consumption, perceptions,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 or perception and conceptions and consciousness.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 All emptiness.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Again, now what that means actually? Emptiness.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Because even though we see all things,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 but reality, if we check that carefully,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 investigating or analyzing through the intellectual level,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 if we're trying to find the core of existing something,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 there's really nothing we can find.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 That is what's called emptiness.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 It's totally openness.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 Totally pervasive.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 And freedom.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 This appearance of this object as it is,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 and that nature of the object is totally union.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 Totally union.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 That means there's no separable.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 No separations.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 For those reasons, in the Heart Sutra we find too,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 poem is emptiness.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Emptiness of home.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Emptiness of home.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 So that means, for example,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 if we're kind of trying to make that little clear to our mind,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 it may be more understandable.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 Our mind is emptiness.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 And we're trying to find where is our mind.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Always we know that in the Dokkien practices.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 Then emptiness is mind.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 That means it's not just when you say emptiness,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 it stops the mind.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 It's arising.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 But it arises.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 There is nothing that we can say where it's coming.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 That's how the nature is.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 This is not just only on the mind.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 This forms.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 It's all that in that natural status.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Poem, song, space.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 All form, feeling, perception,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 conception, consciousness, all.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 But that emptiness, that flexible qualities.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 The pervasive nature that is in the vegetarian teaching

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 or in the higher duality, that's enlightened.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 That's so totally flexible.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 Pervasive, pervasive, unending, unceasing.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Yet there is nothing.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 That's called magical display.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 That's what's called in the teaching, interdependent.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 It's all connected.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Yet there is no substantial solid existing.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 Concrete solid existing.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 That's the way the world is.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 That's the way our form is.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 Our body is like that.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 Our mind is like that.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Really.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 There are for many times in said,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 mirage being, beings of the mirages,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 beings of the dreams.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 It's not just making up this fancy store.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 It's kind of being.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Reality is really like dream.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Dream, or mirage,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 reflection on the moon and water.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 Those are huge examples by the great teacher,

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni, to discover this nature

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 and try to loosen our fixation duality mind.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 This fixation duality mind is so fixed, so strong,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 reality is not like that.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 That's why we got always headaches and troubles, really.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 All the troubles, headaches, difficulty, challenges, all this.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 Those great yogis,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 yogi, yoginis, those great practitioners,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 everything is enlightened.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And even they sang the song,

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 ala alas, ala ala, everything.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Samsara is ala ala, nirvana is ala alas.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Really, these things, it's not just making up.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 They're full of the realization is blooming with calm

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 and peaceful, you and soothing and everything.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 That's what they call transform the samsara into nirvana.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 Nirvana and nirvana.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 For that reason, great master.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 Master Nagarjuna said too, in the teaching,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 there is no samsara.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 The end of samsara is nirvana.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 The end of nirvana is samsara.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 I don't see any difference between samsara and nirvana.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 There is even the slight of the hairs.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 Reality is all is mind.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 You are in mind created.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 For that reason, also great master Mohanarjuna said,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 "kinti padhe kyanamu stok manetar dar kotahyans."

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 When you give up or when you are free from the duality,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 that is the end of samsara.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 That's the end of samsara.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 So that means now you're nirvana.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 So nirvana is not something that we have to travel upon.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 Wherever you ended or wherever we are able to end our duality,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 that is nirvana.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 That is not just nirvana, that's akanishta.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Akanishta, all the pure land that was open in the teaching

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 is beyond the duality.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 We are right there.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 That's how it is really called in the teaching.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 So wooing of the exactly way things appear,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 wooing, seeing everything as enlightened status.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 And of course now, but at the moment, we won't perceive that.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 But intellectually we are understanding.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Theoretically with some understanding,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 that is called woo of the analytic.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Woo of this woo.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 Analytically wooing something that closer to the nature way things are.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 That is a good woo according to Buddhism or according to the teachings.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 And analytic woos.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 Woos, and that is enlightened.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 And now, so now I explain.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Now I explain really about this two woos.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 The wooing, the object as it is.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 And the wooing, the nature of the object as it is.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Both are in the union status.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 And that is so both are union.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 And that is what in the teaching Mahayoga.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 I'm going to go ahead and grab my teaching and sit.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 And great purity of the related truth.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Great purity of the related truths.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 So that means everything is enlightened.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 Great purity, purity, purity.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 And that is the great purity.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 Seeing the object as, as,

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 reality, nature, reality of object as it is.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 Seeing the nature of the object as it is.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 That is, in going back to the teaching said,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 and the great equanimity.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 Great equanimity on the absolute levels.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 Absolute levels.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 So that means, what you see clearly as it is, is relative.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 It's a poem is, is we say poem is like as a Verojana.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 And the feeling is like Varena Sambha.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 Still we are kind of nominating that in one way,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 the five different group.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 And the five different ways of eliminating,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 of the five elements is relatives.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 The mind is following on one after another.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 The absolute truth is nature.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 Nature of that.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 That we cannot follow our mind.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 That's what with the, to kind of, to activate that call,

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 call it emptiness.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 Emptiness.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Emptiness is we cannot really follow.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 We see maybe intellectually sometimes or empty something.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 But this emptiness is of course you all know.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 We heard this so many times.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 It's not blank emptiness.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 Not negation emptiness.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 Not kind of completely absent the emptiness.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 Emptiness maybe that's in his, in his English word.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Means it is, it has full, fullness it has.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 Fullness of the potentials.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 The potentials is all these aggregates, for example.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 Elements are from that emptiness.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 Not the emptiness, it's not blank.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 From that everything is arising.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 It's open because there's openness.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 It's never contradicting.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 Not crowing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 It's allowance.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 Emptiness is allowance.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 It's vastness, spaciousness.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 For example, if we look to our own mind.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 Mind.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
 Mind is emptiness we said.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 I mean it's not just we said, we don't find.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 Even intellectual, skeptical.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 We say, we said, ah, erase mind.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 I don't think they have any answer.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 Never found any answer until today.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
 Maybe in the future who knows.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 Really, even the great intellectual, skeptical.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 And so famous all this.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
 What they found, there's no historical point.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
 Oh, I don't believe maybe they said.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 That's it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
 That's the answer.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
 But that's the solution.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 Believe, I don't believe.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 That is the very desperate statement.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
 I don't believe.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 So that's it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 You don't have anything to say.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 That's the really, that's the according to Buddhism.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 That's the desperate statement.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 That's it.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
 You end it right there.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 Bling.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
 Block states.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
 But from that, the emptiness.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
 From this openness mind.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 All thoughts are coming.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 You never heard thoughts, that congested thoughts.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 Or that traffic jam of thoughts.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
 Really.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 How open?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 That's the vastness that tells.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 Nature is totally open.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
 Not totally.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
 And also so much possible.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 There's no restrictions.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
 That's how the emptiness is.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
 But that emptiness is that display of the emptiness.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 Emptiness is teaching in the Mahayana teaching

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 as well as the Vajrayana teaching.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 And it's really Dharmakaya.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 That emptiness is Dharmakaya.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 This is not just only the Vajrayana teaching.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 Even in Vinaya teaching.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
 That means basic Buddhist school teachings.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
 Teachings.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 For example, great master.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
 Great Buddhist disciples.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
 Three disciples.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 Chari Putara and Mongol Putaras.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 Mongol Putaras.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
 First they met.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 Buddha's disciples.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
 One of the five students known as Tataru.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
 Tataru is very famous in the teachings.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 Buddha said among all my students,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 battle has the best conduct.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
 Among all the students,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
 battle has the best conduct.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
 So when Chari Putara and Mongol Putaras

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
 both are searching for their teachers.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
 I'm sure you may have heard.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 I won't tell all those.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
 But then, now they really,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 they came to the way Buddha is residing.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 And the Buddha knew too that they are there.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
 And now they are really ready to connect with Dharmakaya.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 Chari Putara and Mongol Putaras.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 They are so intellectual, so highly developed,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 and so scholar, and so samadra.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
 Yet they are searching for their spiritual answers

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
 or dharma answers.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 They went to many teachings.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
 They didn't get the satisfaction.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 And then they just came to the Rajagiri,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
 near the Varsabhic mountain,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 the famous capital of the Magadhas at that time.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 The Magadha, they came there and came.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 Buddha also resided there.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
 And Buddha saw, now is the time to help them

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 to usher to dharma.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
 And Buddha saw how they will be inspired.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 By the teachings or by the conduct.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 They saw Buddha saw immediately.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
 So, or by conduct.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 They were inspired by the conduct.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 And then, so Buddha saw that.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
 And so then, Buddha talked to Tataal.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
 Buddha's called among the students.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 Tataal, you must think there is two guys.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 Two guys.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 Chari Putara and Mongol.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
 But you mustn't think.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 When Buddha said that, Tataal is already enlightened.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 (speaking foreign language)

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 And he immediately understood what Buddha means.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 And he accepted.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 Chari Putara.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 Next morning, Tataal.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 And of course, traditionally, every time morning,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
 every day they go to the city on the morning

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
 and get the one meal from the village.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 So, in the morning, and Tataal dress up so nice,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 whatever he had, dharma, of course.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 So many, not many.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 And hold the arms both here.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 And with perfect conduct, perfect movement,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 and he walked toward Chari Putara.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 Mongol Buddha decided, particularly Chari Putara.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
 Far distance, Chari Putara saw.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
 Chari Putara saw.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
 Beautiful conduct that person has.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
 Where he walk, where he dress up.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 And saw, condescended mind.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
 Come and feast while he's walking.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
 I'm going to go ask him, who is your teacher?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
 Who are you?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
 And then he came to Chari, came to Tataal.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
 Tataal.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
 And Chari Putara asked, who you are?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
 And he said, I'm Tataal.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 And then, who is your teacher?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
 And my teacher is Buddha.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
 Buddha.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 And the moment he heard the name of the Buddha,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 the Chari Putara, here with the poles come up.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 Really, something kind of, it met him.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
 And what is that he's teaching?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 Well, that you will know for him.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
 But essence of teaching, what is?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 Essence of that is what he's teaching.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 And essence of teaching is that Chari Putara repeated,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
 such as, in Sanskrit, we joined.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
 That he joined it.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
 That teaching is generally interdependent.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 We call it interdependent.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 But it is the teaching, essence of teaching,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 the teaching of the full noble truth, and the suffering truth,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 cause of suffering truth, and cessation,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 and satyaka truth, and path truth.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
 So what that explaining is all is dependent.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 Suffering truth is a dependent cause of suffering truth.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 It's not just arising by itself.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 It has cause.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
 Nirvana has cause.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 It's path.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 So that is where they connect.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
 It is interdependent, connected.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
 And not just two pieces of their connect.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
 There's a variety of ingredients.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 So many ingredients come together, producing one result.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 That we know when we plant the seed.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 Not just art is enough.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 Not seed is enough.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
 There is need so many things put together and produce.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 That moment he heard shari potter, he got realization.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
 Wow.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
 I never heard that word like that.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
 And he just really got.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 And I want you more, said.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 If you want more, you have to go to see my teacher.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 Teacher.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
 Teacher.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 You go to see teacher.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
 And then shari potter, shari potter, monger potter,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 they put the best friend today each other.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 In the Buddha teaching, they had the previous karma.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 They had always been best friends to each other.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
 So they both told, if anybody got some realization,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 understand, have to immediately share to the others.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
 They made promise.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 They made that promise to each other.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 So now shari potter got realization or some understand.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 He's running toward monger potter.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
 And monger potter is so far where shari potter is coming,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 kind of glowing with the pull of a smile.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
 And he just looks at it and monger potter says,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
 look, you got the nectar.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 Yes, I got the nectar.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
 And then he guided that.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 And monger potter also really got goosebumps.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
 He got the goosebumps.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 And that's all.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
 Now, so they got, oh, now we got.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 Now we got the teaching.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
 But now we should see.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 We see the, oh, yeah, we got the realization, some realization.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 And now we saw the dharma kaya, dharma kaya.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 But now we should see the palm body of this great teacher.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
 So the teaching that what they got realization is like dharma kaya.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
 So that is really in the Vinaya teaching said that.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 Teaching. So this is what the enlightenment call it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 So that's how it is.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
 And then now, and then what is it?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 Among that, so that's really the first two words.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 Among the, in the Virginia teaching,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
 particularly in New York schools, first two.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 Third word is ranreg, in it a bit, is ranreg tawa tawa.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 So first, maybe I didn't say it in a bit.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 First is chuking tawa tawa, chuni tawa tawa, ranreg tawa tawa.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 Chuking tawa tawa is the way object,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 reality where seeing object with exactly reality of the object as it is.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 Reality level that chuking tawa tawa in the bit.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000
 C-H-O-C-H-E-N and tawa and T-A-W-A-A-I tawa and tawa again.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
 And T-A-W-T-A-W-Chuking tawa tawa.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 Chuni tawa tawa, same thing.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 Chuni C-H-O-O-N-Y-I.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 Chuni and tawa tawa are the same.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
 Now third one is ranreg tawa tawa.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 Ranreg R-A-N-G-R-I-G-T-A-T-A-W-A, same thing.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
 So it's the same thing.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
 Chuni tawa tawa, tuni tawa tawa, rare tawa tawa, same thing.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
 What that means?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
 Rare tawa tawa.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
 Who perceiving that phenomena is enlightened?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
 Nature is enlightened.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 Who really perceives or who viewing that?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 Ultimately no other than one's own awareness.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
 Rare is awareness, awareness.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 So beholding the view of the awareness,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 beholding or viewing the view of one's own awareness.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
 That is jukti practices, for example.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
 Jukti practices or when we practice a lineage,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 always look to your mind.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 When you look to our mind,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 is there any subject and object?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 In the jukti level, jukti teaching level,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 there is no subject and object.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
 At this first instant when we looked at,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 there is, it looks like we are looking something,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000
 but the moment you look that second or that moment is dissolved.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
 There is no subject and no object.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 Now you are abiding the perfect real pristine,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:58.000
 the ordinal nature state which is not deluded by the dualities.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 That is the view.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 And so who is the view of the, for example,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 also of the old related truth, the "I",

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 related truth, the "I" enlightened.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
 All absolute truth, the "I" empty there in a union state.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 No other than our own awareness mind.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 But when we devour that, it's merged, it's completely merged

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 and dissolved in that enlightenment or beyond the conception.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
 See this.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000
 So that is generally an understanding of the views.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 And this time view is jukti views.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
 So we go more over next time.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 There'll be more.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 Of course this teaching is excellent.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 And I'm going slowly, but this is, I hope it will,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 some very refreshing of your understanding

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 and your knowledge and contributing our practices.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
 Okay. Thank you very much.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 And I'm going to stop here even though this just started late.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
 Thank you again.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
 And then I think whenever you already know,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 tomorrow we won't have the, through the Zoom teachings,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 teachings on through Zoom, because I'm going to perform the,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
 like empowerment that.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 And of course, generally empowerment and jukti teaching,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 all this is really esoteric, so much esoteric, very esoteric.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 But among that is really empowerment.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
 I kind of feel it's more esoteric.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
 So I don't really feel comfortable to doing this

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 through the Zoom internet and just, I don't really feel that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
 And also it won't help you.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 Even if I do, it won't help you too.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 And also it is somehow, I'm trespassing so far.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
 Then I kind of feel that because of my capabilities

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
 and my situation.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 So do you understand this?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 We won't have tomorrow, the session on the Zoom.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 Then of course, morning and evening and all those.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 And then Monday we started again continuing from this teaching.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 And thank you very much for your understanding.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
 And thank you, everyone.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 Thank you.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
 Thank you.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
 Thank you.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 Thank you, everyone.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
 And now we do a few minute meditation.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 And then we dedicate a merit.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
 Merit, I think it has short dedication.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
 Yeah, it has all that.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 So we paid eight in accordance.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 But first we do a few minute meditation.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 Thank you.
