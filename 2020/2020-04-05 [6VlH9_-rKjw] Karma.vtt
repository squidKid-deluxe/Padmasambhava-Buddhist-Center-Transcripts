00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, participate in me, and again, we are here. Thank you. Thank

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.820
 you very much.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.280
 I take best wishes, and all good things, really, for now and for everyone. Thank you.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.840
 Now, again, I'll talk really about a teaching of the greatest kindness compared to here by the Sh

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.460
akyamuni,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.400
 as you will follow me, according to my cover letters that I share.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:38.440
 And it is a reminder of, to all of us, we all need to practice. We all need to meditate practices,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.000
 practice until we reach the enlightenment. In the Buddha teaching, O Prince,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 when you start practicing that, you should study, you should contemplate, and then you should

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 practice.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.930
 The purpose of the studying and purpose of the contraplating, the operasible purpose of the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.720
 studying,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:08.800
 principle purpose of the contraplating is to practice, meditate, and actualize the realization.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.560
 That is the really principle goal, to get enlightenment.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.220
 Enlightenment is not something that we are coming from outside. It is self-discovery. That's what

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 the teaching says.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.200
 So in order to do that, again, we should really correct our beautiful motivations.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.340
 The sibling, eliminating motivation of the joy and the appreciation, same time, kind and the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.560
 compared thoughts.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 And the one day in the teaching, always, those great masters often would say, "Wasteness motivation

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.960
."

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 Motivation, thinking of all living beings that I like to remove, their suffering, the difficulty,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.240
 the troubles, whatever they are going through, and bring them joy, peace, happiness,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.080
 and ultimate goal to everyone which is enlightened, I like to support.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.800
 For that very reason, I'm going to reflect on the teaching of the Buddha, and I'm going to be a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 Muslim by,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.400
 and all the great masters, also really the teaching said.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 So therefore, we should always stand in beautiful motivation of the joy, appreciation, bodhicitta,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 and then regular motivations. Those are known as the three regular status,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.760
 regular form, regular song, or regular mind.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.840
 All the sometimes, I mean not sometimes, another way can explain perfect place, perfect teaching,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.360
 perfect retinues, perfect teaching, perfect times. Those are the five perfect status.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.880
 So see, everything that's in the pure land of the Buddha Vaidya Sattva, Murugamma Sattva,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.160
 or the Buddha Shakyamuni, all inhabited beings are totally waked up to the ordinary status.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.280
 That means free from the duality, free from all negativities, grasping, habit dependence.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.840
 And when those are removed, the enlightenment is right here. They call it the teaching.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 So really bring up those old beautiful motivations. Even we see in the darkness of the ignorance,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 and sometimes, many times, the kind of duality, always struggling,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.790
 but at least the poor people in 20 minutes, if we light up ourself, that is very beautiful, special

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.960
.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.920
 We're making something really different, making difference to ourself to benefit into the beings.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.000
 Therefore, again, this is all beautiful motivations, beautiful motivations. Then with that,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.560
 I just also thought to talk again, continually talking about the Four Renowned Sessions,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.400
 all four points that will reverse the mind or change the mind.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.320
 And this is the anchor of the practices, foundation of the practices, cornerstones of the practices

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.480
.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.720
 Those are all the great masters of the practice and lineage, measured as one voice.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.240
 It's so important, and we like to make our heart more subtle, tender, more gentle, more thoughtful.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.880
 We should have this paper. This is, we're reflecting, realistic, where things are.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.840
 It's not mystery. It's not Buddhist dogma, or it's not just a kind of new phenomenon.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.040
 It's the reality of this related truth, where things are. So see the truth as truth.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.200
 That's wonderful, according to the teaching. It's really wonderful.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.960
 There's nothing higher and deeper, better than see the truth, exactly as it is.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.480
 That is good, in many elements, it's really good. So therefore, we're going again,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.240
 continually, and one after another, we went firstly, spiritually, human body, or 18 endowments.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.040
 Then second, we discussed a little bit about the empowerment.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.560
 Then we're talking now of the cause and effects.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.680
 Effects are inevitable, ensemble way, karma is inevitable.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.840
 Karma is, of course, a very popular word, word in the West, and everybody knows, you know,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:32.200
 that one is karma. Actually, it's action, activity, whose activity is one's own self,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.880
 individualist activities. When we do the activity, actually,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.040
 what in a gracious teacher, Bodhacharya Krishnamurti said, we can divide it.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.120
 There are so many activities, that it's numerous, actually,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.840
 but we can summarize, though, these are three activities. And positive activities,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:01.480
 negative activities, and neutral activities. And where this is positive, where this is negative,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:09.880
 where this is neutral, are kamaic world. It's no other than one's own mind.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:18.040
 When mind is positive, we need to reflect on the verbally and physically, that is known as

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.720
 positives.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.720
 Because mind is positive, and activity is positive.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.400
 When mind is negative, we need to reflect that negative.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.280
 And verbally or physically, that is known as negative.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.960
 When mind is a kind of neutral state, neither negative, nor positive, or neither or either,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:51.240
 we're just neutral states, but we're at least neutral activities.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.960
 But this time, what we need to do, for the practitioners, we activated positive energies

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:08.600
 and avoided the negatives, mind, and even the neutral, we should change to them.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.240
 Positives. If we do that, that is known as practitioners.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.640
 What are you practicing? You're practicing our steps. I use a simple word, good heart.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:29.000
 We're practicing good heart. We're practicing the principal nature of our own mind.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.880
 I spoke yesterday, too. Of course, it's not something I spoke, and that's you there.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.920
 But you know all that. We all know some. We receive so many teachings from great masters.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.920
 All training, and also always making those things. We know that.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.080
 But sometimes, our own knowledge is told, are kind of left on the shelf or somewhere in the midst

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080
 of our conceptions.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.480
 Not always, and kind of lighten up those things. So today, in a way, I'm going to lighten up,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.640
 but try to shimmer up those qualities, our knowledge and understanding of the proofs.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.480
 I think that's kind of lost in the midst of so many different kind of intellectuals and thoughts.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.680
 So I'm trying to really bring up that. That's what I'm talking about.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.120
 This is not just what I'm talking about, because that's what the gracious teacher,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.200
 the Japji, the new woman, told, and as well as the Buddha, the Modi, Sathya.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.920
 Follow it, and put the steps of their voice. I'm just talking.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.880
 So now, again, as he said, this positive and negative, where is the best?

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:43.000
 It's all in an emptiness mind. Mind is empty. Emptiness mind is the best.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.120
 How that is reflecting? It's coming out as interdependent coordination.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:09:00.920
 Cause and conditions are actuating that energy coming as our usual magical things.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.960
 Or it's coming just like a display. But we need a calm display.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.440
 We're grasping. We're claiming. We're whole.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:25.080
 Mosin living beings, whole. Then we twisted the display of the emptiness mind. Minds.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:33.480
 Then you become whatever, it makes effect on the relative world.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.920
 So therefore, we have to, since we are for a long time, we will be in this relative world.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.600
 Or we will be on this illusion world for a long time.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:53.400
 Therefore, it's so important to know what things, what good, what things to, to avoid it.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.680
 What things we should apply, or keep that, or gather.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:07.960
 Then that's what the teaching said. Avoiding all the negative, all those unvirtues.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.600
 And as well as avoiding all the unvirtues and gathering,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.920
 performing the virtues. That is what we really need to do.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.560
 So when we talk about the unvirtues, I've mentioned yesterday too, I listed.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:34.200
 Again, I'm going to talk really about that. I said the unvirtues and, what's called?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:45.400
 Forbidden unvirtues, or restricted unvirtues, or ruled out unvirtues.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:55.560
 Those days, true unvirtues. First of all, the unvirtues. That is natural unvirtues.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.000
 That is also everybody knows, whether you are believing, believer, or not believers.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.400
 These forces are unvirtues. It's just a natural unvirtues. Everybody knows.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.640
 And again, I told a little bit about that. What are those?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.280
 And that I listed yesterday, but I didn't make clarification, kind of precisely, and kind of in a

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.000
 way, like a ratchet.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.430
 Right. And so forth. What about how the greatest kindness, complicated teacher, bloody white

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.400
 teacher.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:41.640
 Three by the body, four by the speech, and three by the mind.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:53.400
 All toghede is ten unvirtues. Ten unvirtues. All that.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:03.990
 These ten unvirtues, where is it coming from? As I said, it's coming from negative emotions of one

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.800
's own mind.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:16.680
 It's not coming from outside anyway. One's own negative emotions are producing these ten unvirtues.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:27.960
 So we are, or each of us, are the jewel, creator, public creator of these ten unvirtues.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:35.800
 Virtues. So what are those negative emotions? Three principle negative emotions, which are known as

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.120
, again,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:44.780
 great teacher, Buddha Shakti, I am going to use the metaphor, that we all know. Posen. Three

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.320
 poisons or five poisons.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:55.000
 Three poisons are the ignorance, attachment, anger.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.440
 Above that two more, arrogance, jealous.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.960
 Arrogance and jealous are a combination of ignorance and attachment and anger.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:13.210
 Then there is more, in the teachings, in Abhidharma, there are six principles of emotions, and two

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.680
 sub-emotions.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.040
 So forth. There are many, but those are the gross, rude emotions.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:30.230
 These negative emotions are, if we're talking about the poor, noble truth, these are the cause of

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.800
 suffering.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:40.360
 It's the cause of suffering. They are the cause of suffering. They are the cause of troubles.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.520
 They are the cause of all the difficulties, challenges we go through.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:52.040
 That's what these three poisons or five poisons are.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:14:01.400
 With that method, then it becomes the unvirtues. These unvirtues are the suffering truth.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:09.230
 Even that activated through the verbally, mentally, when it's mentally existing, and when it's

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.880
 mentally,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.280
 the energy, that physically verbally comes, it creates suffering.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:22.280
 It creates suffering. One person who rejects or injects that, also suffers.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 When it's reflected to others, it will create suffering, and it's a difficult challenge.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.160
 This is not just the Buddha's teaching, we're talking Buddha's teaching, or I have to believe.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.320
 This is true evidence on the related world.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.640
 But that's why many times, in these modern times, men met sufferings.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:52.880
 Men met sufferings. This is what, the fundamental way this comes from, the cause of suffering truth

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.240
.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.400
 Negative emotions. Posen. That's why it's called the poisons.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:05.320
 It's poisons. If poisons one's own self, it poisons others.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.000
 Then, this created the karma. Immediately that created the karma.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.840
 A cordial Buddhism and the Buddha's teaching, karma.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.960
 That, the cause of the suffering is going to be gone.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.600
 A jewelry cell, and when it's reflected outside, that creates the karma.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.280
 But that not ended there.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:33.000
 Now, it's a ripple, affectable becoming. Continue it for a long time.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 What that means, a cordial Buddhism is coming so many lifetimes.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.840
 And of course, you all know, the Buddhism believes rebirth.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.320
 Life is not just a false time in this world, nor it is not last time.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.800
 This life is a life. Be continuous from the beginning.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.360
 And we will go continually to that far, long way.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.320
 Unless we stop this roller coaster of these negative emotions, then we can reverse the cordial

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.960
 teaching.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:17.400
 We can change the modem, the move we can change. Otherwise, it will be continuous.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:24.040
 Now, by this three, now we go a little bit again, because I just told you.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.400
 I told you a little bit again, this ten unvirtuous.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.180
 Even though you, we all know. I mean, I know that way, and you all know, I'm sure you all know this

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.400
.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.080
 But I'm just reminded. Again, we draw focus, because it's our practices.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:47.000
 Practice means, we have to practice with mindfulness. We have to be mindfulness.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.520
 What things to be avoided, what things to be gathered.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.960
 Being mindful is a symbol of the practice of the Buddha teachings. Mindfulness.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:07.800
 More calm, more gentle, more peaceful, calm body, calm speech, and calm mind.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:16.140
 Or gentle physical activity, gentle verbal, and gentle mind is the one really known as a pullover

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.200
 of the gracious, kindness, compassion teacher, Prasad Shaktaman.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.920
 So therefore, again, I just go over this, really, of all those things.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:37.720
 And now, three by body, and this is taking three non-virtuous of the three by body.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:51.890
 Taking lives, and taking the blindness of others, which is not permitted, and then, and sexual

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.280
 misconducts.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.640
 Sexual misconduct is for the ordinary known as a sexual conduct.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:08.040
 But lay practice is a sexual misconduct. So, those are the three by the body.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:14.530
 Why not they are, like I said, negativities? Naturally, because they are completely, absolutely

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.320
 best on the negative emotions.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:25.080
 It's best upon the ignorance, it's best upon the attachment, it's best upon the anger.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:32.060
 For example, when somebody is taking lives of others, either in the teachings, it has maybe three

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.200
 different principles or reasons.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.080
 First, taking lives of others is the best on the anger.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:46.120
 And then, anger is the prime runner, along with the support of ignorance and attachments.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:54.520
 So that is such as killing one, revenge, or killing the animals, enemies.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:03.480
 Those are the principles of the killing, that emotion is anger.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:10.220
 There is a principle runner, when we check the lives of others, there is a principle runner, it's

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.400
 attachment.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:21.700
 Also, we care. Because we like their skins, or we like their wealth, we like to eat this meat, we

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.080
 like to eat.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:32.360
 or like there is something kind of desired then again is best on the anger and ignorance and we can

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.440
 protect lives

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:43.080
 and then another one is through the ignorance according Buddhism killing our ignorant or

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:51.640
 taking life the ignorant such is sacred preaching thinking is good to sacrifice one's own purpose

00:19:52.280 --> 00:20:00.360
 one's own benefit or I like to sacrifice that or that kind of thing that's good

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:07.960
 but life is so precious to everyone there is no difference at all according Buddhism

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:20.120
 everyone is loves their lives every last breath they loves one time I read read on the newspaper

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:29.640
 say the what's called the famous apple ponder Steve John he said even individual knows that

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:36.520
 they are going to heaven but still they like to love their these lives even they they show they

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:43.880
 are going to the heaven heaven but still everyone loved their lives I thought that's really very

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:53.160
 true true life is so precious to everyone therefore taking that with negative emotions

00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:02.760
 that is negative it is but that is not ended there as I said that create the karma that

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:14.920
 affects goes on and on on and on and on and on so many times so many light so there being as

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:23.000
 practitioners we try to be more more kind of avoid those things as much as we can that is

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 good according Buddhism I'm talking about the Buddhism that in the Buddhism that's a really good

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:37.720
 and the next one is again I go really about that and then taking belongings of others

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.240
 with all the permitted by others that is known as taking what's called stealing I think simple

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.960
 language stealing stealing and according Buddhism there's three different ways stillings

00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:02.120
 stealing by the powers powers screaming by the postfulness then the smelling by the sneaky

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:10.920
 hiding behind sneaking those are all the stealing not just the stillings or that

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:18.520
 or the first one is a string taking belongings of the power such as the kind of very powerful man

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.120
 powerful the kind of lady or whatever mine is open instead of I want that I like to check that

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.960
 without it can't be any permission from the others yes sir check that by the power

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:39.400
 power that is known as stealing by the powers taking belongings of the by others

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:48.440
 others without permissions then stealing of the robins that I think robbers robbery against us

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:58.520
 kind of come across and kill and attack things things or rob things that is called by them like

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:06.920
 robbery or kind of like just like as robbers robbers and then sneakily stealing and that is what

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:16.360
 best upon again sneakily you're still and when these people do that what are those again the

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:25.880
 fundamental the intention is anger or jealous or arrogance or ignorance those are the real

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:34.040
 attachment those are the fundamental cause to think take things things from from other

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:41.800
 individuals without any formations or the yeah formations so that is really about that again

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:52.360
 the stillings that so again we should those practices have to be trying to be ready again

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:59.880
 in a buddhist teaching of course this is more again what's called more like this ruled out

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.080
 unvirtuous there is a measurement of the taking things of that you can how much you if you take

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:13.560
 things without the permission but that will consider it is a small amount I mean small

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.720
 amount with our own kind of desire attachment or anger and like to hurt with others or something

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.400
 whatever reason take that it's just a no matter what about the size is big or small I mean it's

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:32.360
 really even small standard taking say that so those all known as like stillings there is sexual

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:39.240
 misconduct also by many times of course is through the attachment or the desires but also it has

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.560
 many

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:46.920
 times that happen with anger with jealous jealous and then of course all is supported by the

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:54.360
 ignorance ignorance is behind and not knowing clearly exactly consequence then we act so it's

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.760
 ignorance ignorance is behind but the sexual misconduct or sexual conduct with the attachment

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.280
 with anger with the jealous or like kind of like to hurt someone and therefore I'm going to do

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:14.440
 or something kind of like this all known as as again negative it is negative it is so this is the

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:29.880
 one of the three virtues of the body and the four by the speech and those are lying

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:45.160
 slender and gossi and harsh speech harsh again it's all based on the negative emotions

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:52.920
 ignorance attachment and angles angles and actually in the buddha sitting optimally there

00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:02.200
 is small lies medium lies and the big lies small lie is just a very small smoke and I'm like you

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.320
 all know I'm not going to talk that small lie is just small things and maybe some small reasons

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.800
 you lie that has nothing big things but it is just small lies and the big lies is some

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.920
 got a bigger purposes and making some stories and all that things and you deceive the others

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:27.720
 that and the very big law lie is then known as in the buddhist of teaching it is you kind of

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:34.200
 activated even yourself kind of elevated or I'm having great realization I am such a distant

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:42.680
 that things kind of lying aboard the realizations and trying to to uh receive others other and

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:50.280
 take the advantage explaining about your real your own realization put turning with realization and

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:57.800
 making up those things those are known as pretty lies and whatever it is lie is deceived mean is

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.960
 changing the mental state for others and then you you kind of like convince them and take the

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:11.960
 advantage so that is lies and then tama that is a cylinders cylinder is again there is a three

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.280
 different cylinders it's called openness cylinders and the sneaker cylinders sneaker open the

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:18.920
 cylinder

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:24.680
 is again the power of a man kind of achieved two friends the power of a man like to be split then

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.840
 they said open the night in front oh you said something funny things to to this person said and

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.680
 you shouldn't do these things so kind of open and using their own authoritative powers making the

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:43.560
 story the reality trying to break the bound or the pressure of others others those are now openly

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:51.400
 slangers cylinders and then sleeker sneakers cylinder is again making stories behind the

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.960
 scene so when a student again is the best upon the negative emotions ignorance attachment anger

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.400
 or callousness whatever is is combination there and then making kind of all different stories that

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.000
 even those one person who know this is not true but i like to talk these things make this kind of

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.720
 value make this that like to hurt the others or make something because their own design and that

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.800
 is a cylinders and that's it's up the next one is heart speeches heart speaking is not making

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:37.560
 heart speech heart speeches is again is such as like what's called openly talking about the

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:47.080
 mistakes the errors of the individuals the family sides of palisade mother's side or their features

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:57.720
 their education they kind of like well whatever openly openly kind of kind of making the hearts

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:06.680
 making those heart speech those are known as heart speeches so again that's the best of no

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:15.800
 matter whatever it is it is anger or is attachment that again it is negative and the next one is a

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:23.720
 gossip gossip and the gossip is again best upon all these negative emotions but mainly maybe is

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:30.600
 best on the ignorance maybe not the persona of the anger and all these things but is more kind of

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.680
 ignorant best of that and then you make all different kind of like stories or the gossiping

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:42.680
 all these things and then this modern time time these are all watching so many times like i mean

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.240
 that's my my talk watching so many times of the all those are looking to the internet and looking

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:56.200
 to the to the televisions are looking to the rest so much time and what we gain is nothing really

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:03.400
 gaining too much things it's all negative emotions and all and yes it's spoiled our mental

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:10.120
 spoil our enemies and that in the watching all this i'm kind of spending that that is just i

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:16.520
 think it's really kind of from gossip so that's just the whole gossip is again best upon upon the

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:26.680
 negative emotions then three by the mind nothing is the coincidence or something their person

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.920
 belonging to others yo whatever that is first belongings of the others you're trying to really

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:39.560
 kind of capture that or grab that or have that or even you really get but you kind of you just

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.240
 kind of obsessed with uh poured on at that again and again those are known as

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:56.360
 comatose comatose nazi nazi and then nazi is a negative thought violence thought like to hurt

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:03.800
 others again with negative emotions anger attachment or ignorance like that that is nazi

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:13.320
 and the next one is last one is is non-believers and not believe to anything any abilities just

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.230
 a kind of close to every knowledge and understanding and yes only yourself thinking thinking or

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.720
 your own

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:26.360
 person what you see that kind of completely stopping have no believer believing any things

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:33.400
 and therefore again that means there's no believing not in the past believing not in the future

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.560
 believing not anything then i just can't really really block in that according buddhism it is

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:48.920
 really won't grow develop anything so it is a really very kind of uh very wake but very deep

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:57.880
 negative videos that could hurt that so those are all known as non-virtues or natural non-virtues

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:08.920
 ten non-virtues now i just listed to you the ten virtues i said yesterday is opposite of that

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:19.720
 but i can again if i talk more can find clearly that opposite of the taking lives is giving lives

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:28.680
 to the others if you have the capability giving lives of the others is is a virtues and the

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.400
 opposite

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:37.480
 of and give stealing or the technique belong to the others if you have the capability giving to

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:50.360
 some to the others or doing generosity that is a virtues and then as well as and opposite of the

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:58.200
 sexual misconduct is awarded sexual misconduct in the same time maintaining this some during

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:09.560
 ethics ethics or moralities that is a virtues and then the opposite of the line is speaking truth

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:20.040
 truthful that is and it's a opposite of a slender bring harmonizing bring together

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:29.800
 together harmonizing more friendly in creating environments that is positive that is a virtues

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:40.440
 and the opposite of the harsh speech soft speaking gentle speaking polite speaking

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.160
 one great teacher bodhaka karmani said when you look to the sentient beings

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:52.200
 look with eye of compassion look to the sentient beings and smile with face with compassion

00:33:52.200 --> 00:34:03.480
 and speaking softly gentle polite and respectful those are all known as known as virtues opposite

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:12.840
 of the harsh speech and opposite of the gossip speak meaningful see meaningful and then in the

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.000
 buddha city of remaining is very gossipy to practice

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:28.020
 join the mantra change the whole money with me homes home better south homes oh better south homes

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:40.200
 oh better good with my siblings giant mantras can enjoy relax go see bring so many unnecessary

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:48.040
 garages in the mind and holy energy channels are filled with with the gossips

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:56.680
 and gathering gossip all over the world what we were going to gain what anyway going to

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:04.200
 result what we get what we can do instead there is a kind of culture that we love and compete and

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:12.200
 join peace and joining some mantra is more meaningful to ourselves or one's own self to the others

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:22.440
 so those are opposite of the poor negative by the mind or opposite or four virtues of the of the

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:34.520
 speech and then the opposite of the conscious more grateful more contentment how big what do you

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:34.760
 have

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:45.800
 be too enjoy napsi or this individual nothing but in a indian comedy comedic mentality is very poor

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:54.680
 never enough is the kind of hunger ghost please just be happy do what you have of course you can

00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.440
 help all that but we shouldn't be kind of like we have that comment just kind of thinking i need

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:00.680
 that

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:08.360
 i want that all now this goes on and on this ego clinging is always hungry we have to put some kind

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:19.880
 of breaks to that feel happy and joy joy with that and then the opposite of the violence thought

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:27.960
 more love more kindness more both each other's and opposite of the wrong opposite of the wrong

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:36.360
 belief believe there is past there is future there is is is the present and there's so many things

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:44.600
 even we don't see everywhere and we don't have to know everything but there is so many things

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:52.120
 in the maybe 700 years ago every wall is in the way closed everybody thinks maybe that's

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.560
 the only the wall almost everyone think but now wall wall is open how many things here

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:04.760
 whole around the wall even now the scientists exploring so many galaxies so many universes

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:14.760
 but us i mean that's all open there's so many we shouldn't close to complete that open relax

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:25.240
 dribble up progress in a world of analogies so those are known as ten virtues that we should

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:34.600
 always gather this ten virtues what i said today is the ten virtues of the next natural

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:41.160
 two virtues and that's what i said also said the non-virtuous ten then what is natural everybody

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:49.000
 knows whether believer or not believer most people know that they know it's bad even animal world

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.280
 knows have you cheated with you see them they will know and if we kill them they don't they don't

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:05.880
 like i mean no no this is universally proved proved so that's what really said then that ruled out

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:16.280
 the non-virtuous virtues i talked really tomorrow because today our time is kind of the wall

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:22.360
 and so i told her over but of course you all know really i talked about tomorrow tomorrow okay

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.600
