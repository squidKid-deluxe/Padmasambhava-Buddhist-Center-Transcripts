00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.680
 We have gathered together once again to get some time and savor our opportunity to connect

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.040
 with and practice, and also reflect on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro, and also the Buddha

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.700
 Dharma in general. So we'll begin again. As we always do, is to reconnect to our home

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.880
 base, which is principally about our motivation. What is my mind doing? What's my heart doing?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 So those three key points that we always come back to, that Venerable Kambaramichas and

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.560
 all these lineage masters just always come back to, is one, awaken the mind aimed towards

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:01.080
 liberation. We do this by renouncing the causes of suffering. So this renunciation mind, our

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.980
 joy and appreciation, so bring up this buoyant, bright, joy and appreciation for this precious

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.960
 opportunity we have to absorb even further and integrate the Dharma with our lives every

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.280
 breath, so this joyful kind of approach. And then all beings, like our parent sentient

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.840
 beings, who've cared for us so much for so long, then try to bring them to mind that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.200
 part of the motivation is that we're going to study and practice the Buddha Dharma so

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.760
 that we can be of immediate, direct, effective benefit to each and every single sentient

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.360
 being so they can be happy, and be free from the causes of suffering and suffering itself,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.800
 and eventually, hopefully very soon, attain liberation, enlightenment. And then thirdly,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 this is a Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhist practice, then we reawaken or reignite our pure perception

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 or that devotion, the closeness we have to the lineage, to our own true nature, to the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.560
 true nature of all beings. So we awaken, turn on this pure perception, kind of be and see

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.000
 that form, sound, space, that all these experiences we have, like right now, this very moment,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.520
 is essentially and completely pure. It is unstained, it is perfect, and just the very

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.240
 nature of this experience now and all experience, outer inner, the world, and all the beings

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.000
 in it are essentially pure. So we kind of turn on these three qualities of joy and appreciation

00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:07.720
 and bodhicitta and pure perception.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 Thank you. So it's such a sacred opportunity to have, to reflect on the Dharma and today,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.600
 the topic kind of going to explore just a little bit, called bodhicitta, leaning into

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.960
 the future beyond this life. So bodhicitta, leaning into the future beyond this life.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:41.800
 So the principal topics here, in terms of the nandro, is this bodhicitta and also impermanence.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.600
 The great master, Auryasya Yune, is like a pillar of the semde lineage, the mind class.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.720
 In zogchen, these are the two foundations of authentic zogchen practice, bodhicitta,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.760
 heartfelt bodhicitta, and also this very visceral lived experience of impermanence. This

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.560
 opportunity

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.720
 is constantly leaving us, it's dissolving, it's like such a special rare time we have

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.840
 to practice and study the Dharma. So if we really ignite these two in our lives, impermanence

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.040
 and bodhicitta, it lines everything up, we kind of tune into the nature so that we become

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.380
 receptive of the nature, we can fully express the nature, our own nature. These are essential

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.200
 as Vajrayana practitioners and zogchen practitioners, and that means practitioners of the dudjim

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.720
 tersar nandro. So today, to explore this topic a little bit, which we won't do very long,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 it will be kind of a little condensed, I'm largely just going to rely on the precious

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.440
 sacred Vajra words of some of the masters. They were so fortunate to have close to us

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.200
 that their words still exist, some of them still alive. So highlighting this, the fact

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.400
 of bodhicitta, and there's only so much time we have to really mingle our minds with bodhicitta.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.840
 And so what does that mean in the context of this life? It's just a very, the window

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.160
 is always closing more and more, this life. So kind of go jump right into the words of

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.440
 some of these great masters. And I thought to kind of the big frame is for today, there's

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:35.000
 37 practices of the bodhisattvas. By the great master, Nautrul Tomai Zangpo, the 37 practices

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.600
 of the bodhisattvas in stanza four, the fourth practice, is that long associated companions

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.460
 will part from each other. Wealth and possessions obtained with effort will be left behind.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.520
 Consciousness, the guest will cast aside the guest house of the body. Letting go of this

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:11.400
 life is the bodhisattva's practice. So then the second big frame is called parting from

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.240
 the four attachments. And this was a teaching that was said to be directly taught by Manjushri

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:26.320
 to Sanchinkunga Ninkpo, parting from the four attachments. If you are attached to this life,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:37.360
 you're not a true spiritual practitioner. If you're attached to samsara, you have no renunciation.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:47.840
 If you're attached to your own self-interest, you have no bodhicitta. If there is grasping,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.680
 you do not have the view. I'll repeat these. If you're attached to this life, you're not

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:04.440
 a true spiritual practitioner. If you're attached to samsara, you have no renunciation. If you're

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.880
 attached to your own self-interest, you have no bodhicitta. If there is grasping, you do

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:19.720
 not have the view. So these are the general frames for kind of this contemplation before

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.840
 we do the dujum tursar andra practice. And so it's good to highlight specifically with

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.480
 these parting from the four attachments, the second, third, and fourth are the same three

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.320
 points that we try to bring up at the beginning of every time we study and practice renunciation.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.680
 Bodhicitta and pure perception. And this pure perception is based on the middle wave and

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.920
 yamaka view. And then in addition, it includes pure relative truth, which we just very casually

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:54.000
 easily call pure perception. So great equality with pure relative truth. This is called pure

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.480
 perception. So these three points, even in these four parting from the four attachments,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.760
 they're highlighting three of the points we really try to activate every time we turn

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.380
 our minds toward the dharma, renunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception. These are so

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:17.080
 essential, which just means it'll only be good for us to keep coming back to them again

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.400
 and again and again, because that's what we have to do in our practice anyway. So they'll

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:29.480
 never go wrong. They'll always be reliable ways to orient our study and our practice.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.380
 So if we're kind of have an afternoon, we don't know what to do, reflect on or practice

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.600
 renunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception, or just mingle it with whatever we happen

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.640
 to be doing. Well, then we'll have three of these will apart it from three of the big

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.840
 four attachments, at least in that time where we're really activating that. And then the

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.960
 first one, if you're attached to this life, you're not a true spiritual practitioner.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.520
 This is kind of a strong topic. It's a strong statement, as well as the 37, the fourth practice

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.780
 of the bodhisattva. Letting go of this life is the bodhisattva's practice. Sometimes it

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.960
 seems good to highlight the impermanent nature of our opportunity now. That it's just, you

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:26.640
 know, we only have so long. And then what comes after we pass, we die, you know, we'll see.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.840
 But while the opportunities in our hands, like we really do have so much on our own

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:38.640
 side to practice the Dharma and to study to refine our habits. I thought a big point of

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.800
 this is part of the full Dharma path isn't just to know that they're suffering. That's

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:53.080
 the first noble truth. There is suffering, suffering of suffering, suffering of change,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:02.320
 suffering of conditioned existence. We have to clearly hold that in mind. Then in addition,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.680
 we have to look, what's the cause of suffering? Is there a way to completely remove the cause

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.000
 of suffering? And if there is, what's the path of doing that? We shouldn't stop at the

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.440
 first noble truth, not just their suffering. Because if we only go that far and we don't

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.480
 work on the causes of suffering and removing them, then this, it basically kind of ruins

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.440
 all of our fun. It's just, we're going to see suffering everywhere. Pervasive suffering

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.080
 of conditioned existence. We can't stop there as Dharma practitioners. We have to actually

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.160
 look at the cause, which the Buddha taught was our own kleshas, our own afflictive emotions,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.800
 our own grasping and the activities we do based on that grasping. And we have to really try

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.040
 to uproot them and not feed them so much until they're really totally gone. This is what

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.840
 it means to be a Dharma practitioner and this is completely an inside job. The cause of suffering

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.480
 is my own afflictive emotions and the activities I do based on them. It's my own grasping and

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:13.240
 the activities I do with grasping mind. It's just usually called duality mind. This has

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:23.520
 to be uprooted. That's the path. And then how do we uproot this? Bodhicitta. There's

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.560
 two bodhicittas we've all heard, relative and absolute bodhicitta. So I'll jump to Venerable

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.880
 Kempa Ramache's and Illuminating the Path, their nundra book on the Dujum Tersar nundra,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.040
 which we've referred to quite a lot for these times. I'm just jumping to page 93. When

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.080
 Buddha Shakyamuni was alive, there was a famous king named Prasanajet who ruled much of northern

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.960
 India from his capital in Shrivasti. He's very devoted to the Buddha but did not have

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.280
 a lot of time to practice because of his worldly duties. His heart was with the Buddha but

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.280
 he couldn't connect deeply with the Dharma. This worried him, so one day he asked the Buddha

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.080
 what to do. The Buddha said, "If you can do only one practice, you will be applying

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.520
 yourself all the time." "What would that be?" asked the king. "It is generating bodhicitta,"

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:22.120
 said the Buddha. "Bring bodhicitta into each of your daily activities, whether you are

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.280
 standing, walking, sitting, or sleeping. While you are governing the kingdom or whatever

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.920
 you are doing, if you keep bodhicitta in your heart, it will transform all your actions

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:41.600
 into the practice of Dharma." So not only do we know this life is fleeting and we're

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.320
 not really so sure what's next, we do know what we need to do to uproot the cause of

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:54.060
 suffering, is activate bodhicitta. Kind of simply put, sometimes it's good to just hit

00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:00.880
 the essentials. Oh, the second one of this, which is jumping two pages ahead. I almost

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.160
 forgot, I was a little worried to say it, but then, we always, this book we've referred

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:13.280
 to so much in this. Page 96, Venerable Kambhramache's. Patra Rambhache said that without bodhicitta

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.880
 firmly established in your heart, even if you have memorized the Dzogchen Tantras and

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.320
 can quote all the Mahamudra texts, you're merely paying lip service to the Dharma. He

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.200
 said that no matter how vast your view is, without bodhicitta, whatever you say is the

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.680
 doctrine of demons. He felt strongly about this, saying that people who talk about their

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.780
 experiences of bliss and emptiness and Vajrayana practice without having bodhicitta as a foundation

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:50.280
 should have their mouths stuffed with the garbage of nine cities. Kind of strong. That's

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.280
 Patra Rambhache, the great master Patra Rambhache, words of my perfect teacher. This is just

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.520
 to say, it's all about bodhicitta, and if we're not really taking that to heart, which

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.960
 I don't all the time, then watch out, and like wasting my time. I'm wasting my precious

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:14.200
 opportunity to actually completely uproot the causes of my own suffering so I can really

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:23.880
 help other beings. So watch out, Rakpa. Garbage of nine cities. Secondly, these are so many

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.100
 gems here. The heart treasure of the enlightened ones by his Holiness Dzogchen Tantra Rambhache.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:41.080
 This is such a sacred text. Page 32. In this decadent age, let's see here. One second.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:52.480
 Page 33. So it's in the chapter, the shortcomings of our decadent age. If you follow the example

00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:00.800
 of most people in this decadent age, you will end up being just like them, an expert fraud.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.060
 You will waste your life chasing after the unattainable. You will be like children who

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.000
 are so busy playing that they're indifferent to hunger and cold and don't notice the day

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.480
 passing until it gets dark and they suddenly remember their mother and start crying. If

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.480
 you genuinely want to help beings, you must first perfect yourself. If you make a lot

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.280
 of ambitious plans, doing business, collecting disciples, and setting yourself up as a teacher,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.980
 you will end up like a spider caught in its own web. Spending your life spinning such

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.800
 webs, you won't notice how fast time is passing until you suddenly realize that death is at

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.260
 hand. You will have used all your energy and gone through all sorts of hardships, but these

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.880
 hardships, like the trials of spiritual practice, will not have helped you in the least to improve

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.440
 yourself. The Holy Kadampa teachers used to practice in a very humble way, completely

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.880
 disregarding comfort and entertainment. And our teacher, Buddha Shakimuni, left the pleasures

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.120
 of his palace behind and practiced austerities for six years. Since we are his followers,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.960
 should not we too relinquish all worldly concerns, forget the endless distractions of our friends

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.720
 and relatives, and wholeheartedly follow the instructions of a genuine teacher?

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.920
 What is the good of getting involved in samsara issues? Everything in samsara undergoes constant

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.680
 upheaval. Millionaires become beggars, and beggars become millionaires. Whatever happens,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.000
 people are never content. If they make a million, they want to make two. If they make two million,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.040
 they want to make three. How will you ever be satisfied like that? There is only one

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.880
 thing of which you should never feel you have had enough. Your dharma practice. Be like

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.560
 a hungry yak who, as he grazes, is always looking ahead to see where more grass can

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.820
 be found. If you practice in this way, you won't be disappointed. If you actually tried

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.720
 to achieve everything you want for this life, there would never be enough time. It is said

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.600
 all those plans are like children's games. If we put them into action, they will never

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:09.900
 be finished. But if we just drop them, they are all finished at once.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:22.800
 So this is related with renunciation mind. It is good to emphasize too that even a little

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:29.280
 bit of turning towards these teachings is a significant adjustment. It is really beneficial.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.960
 We don't have to achieve enlightenment all at once. It is never how that happens. Little

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:40.880
 by little. So we don't have to hold some giant end goal, and if we are not there tomorrow,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.000
 then we get upset. Every little step is so significant. So we should really celebrate

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.800
 and rejoice in all the good things we can do to orient our minds towards the dharma,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.480
 and to be kind to others, and generate bodhicitta even for a moment. I am going to end on an

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:04.440
 inspiring note, but before, I am going to kind of pull out the rug a little more, okay?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.040
 All right, this is his only saki-trisen, the forty-first saki-trisen. Freeing the heart

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:20.880
 and mind. Introduction to the Buddhist Path, page eighty-six. This is on parting from the

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:29.240
 four attachments. This specific book, most of it is on parting from the four attachments.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.540
 So this first line of the parting from four attachments again, "If you have attachment

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:40.680
 to this life, you are not a religious person." And we said before, "Not a spiritual practitioner."

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.840
 Then his onlyness goes on to say, "The general contents of this first line are common to

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:50.520
 Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana traditions. The first line directly describes the right

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.800
 way and the wrong way to practice dharma. Right dharma practice, pure dharma practice,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.880
 is not attached to this life. Practicing dharma with attachment to this life is not real dharma.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.040
 It is still just worldly activity. Just like a mirage that appears to be water but does

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.960
 not quench thirst, such activity is apparently dharma but does not liberate you from the

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.760
 sufferings of samsara. If you practice dharma with attachment to this life, any practice

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.760
 that you do, whether it is moral conduct, study, contemplation, or meditation, will

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:28.200
 not even result in the accomplishment of prosperity in this life. If the goal of dharma practice

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.920
 is to gain fame, disciples, or wealth, the practice will become the seed of the lower

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.200
 realms and samsara instead of becoming the seed of liberation and enlightenment. It is

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.400
 not actual dharma practice. The great Indian master Vasubandhu said, "Upon a base of sound

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.760
 moral conduct, hear, contemplate, and thoroughly apply yourself to meditation." To be pure

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.880
 dharma, whatever practice you do should not be mixed with attachment to this life. This

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.240
 is because this life is very transient. Very few people live longer than 100 years. This

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:08.760
 life is also without essence. Everything is impermanent and is not really worthy of attachment.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.850
 The goals of the dharma path have many different levels. To say nothing of liberation or

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.840
 enlightenment,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.280
 we should, at minimum, practice for a purpose beyond this life. In other words, at least

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.740
 for the benefit of our next life. The first line of the teaching, "If you have attachment

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.840
 to this life, you are not a religious person," directly explains the right and wrong ways

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.060
 to practice dharma. Indirectly, it points to the difficulty of obtaining a precious

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:41.600
 human birth endowed with the 18 prerequisites. It also, because of impermanence, indicates

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:48.560
 the importance of diligently practicing dharma without any delay. Not only humans, but every

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.180
 sentient being possesses Buddha nature. The true nature of every sentient being's mind

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:59.160
 is unstained by obscurations. Any sentient being that meets with the right methods has

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.720
 the opportunity to become a fully enlightened Buddha. However, among the six types of sentient

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.720
 beings, human beings have the best chance to accomplish Buddhahood. Therefore, this human

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.920
 life, in particular, when endowed with 18 prerequisites, is very precious and difficult

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:25.120
 to find. So I think what it does actually is really trying to focus not just on this

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.120
 life, the immediate benefit of dharma, but at least next life, and then on and on and

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.900
 on into the future, is it actually makes us use our time right now really well. If we

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.820
 really take a long-term and vast view, thinking about all beings, for as long as it takes,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:50.880
 which is what bodhicitta does, then it means it'll immediately make us want to really seize

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:58.800
 the opportunity of right now, which doesn't mean give up all the things we love and shave

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.960
 our heads and go never talk to anyone again. It means really actively activate bodhicitta

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:10.320
 right now and then do all the things of our daily lives. If being a monastic is more like

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.280
 what suits your mind to really bring up bodhicitta, then do that. Or if having kids does that,

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.000
 or if being in a cave does that, or if just working at your job does that, whatever it

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.680
 is, just like the Buddha taught to King Prasannajit, bodhicitta is the main practice and everything

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.400
 becomes dharma practice if we bring up bodhicitta. So if we really think, if we're really concerned

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.840
 about the future, it really means bring up bodhicitta now and not just so that I'll be

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:45.700
 free of suffering, but all beings will be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.360
 And so then here we get more into the strict definition of bodhicitta, because there's

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:58.200
 relative bodhicitta and absolute bodhicitta. And I'm just really wanting to like, resound

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.120
 the words of these noble beings, because we have these noble beings are here and their

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.220
 words are here. So I've kind of thought to just use this time mainly to just recite what,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.360
 you know, repeat their words, repeat the words of the Buddha, this will never go wrong. So

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:20.320
 here, if we're looking more at the absolute nature of bodhicitta, because it's not just

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:27.000
 being nice, it's actually about removing all the causes of suffering for all beings. So

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.680
 then jump to this book, not for happiness, which is another way to say it's not just

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:38.460
 about being nice. A guide to the so called preliminary practices. This is also another

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:45.960
 commentary on Dijam Tersar Nandro. By jumping, sorry, Zogsar Jamin Kensei Rinpoche. I'm jumping

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.880
 here to page 114, where he starts discussing bodhicitta and kind of highlighting more the

00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:02.840
 absolute nature of bodhicitta. Until we've established a complete understanding of bodhicitta,

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:09.640
 we will continue to make the mistake of imagining that pain truly exists. As a result, we will

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.400
 almost certainly become the victims of our own compassion. And without fully appreciating

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:22.560
 non-duality, our every activity will lead to disappointment. For example, as a therapist,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.600
 how far are you prepared to go to help an alcoholic or a drug addict? Imagine that one

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.920
 of your clients is certain to be reborn a drug addict for the next 5000 lifetimes. As

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:39.440
 a bodhisattva, your determination to help her should be so great that you aspire to

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:45.040
 be reborn at the right time and in the right place during every one of those lifetimes,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:52.960
 so you can continue her treatment. Fast forward to the 5000th lifetime. Your client has been

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:59.300
 reborn in a lonely, God forsaken country, and all you have to do to ensure that she

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:06.000
 will never again be reborn as an addict is hang out with her for half a day. This means

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.800
 that you must also be reborn in that wretched place and that the entire focus of your life

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.320
 will be to get you to the right place at the right time to spend those few hours with your

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:23.680
 client. To do this, you will need what the teachings describe as strength or determination,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.720
 courage and commitment, right? And you will only find this strength once you come to realize

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:36.600
 the illusory nature of all phenomena. In other words, emptiness. So how do you develop the

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.320
 remarkable strength of compassion you need to be able to behave so selflessly? How do

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.320
 you develop the determination never to give up? Where do you find the confidence and tenacity

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.400
 to keep trying? Every one of these qualities springs from the realization that the drug

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.920
 addict, her problem, that she can be healed, and even the idea that she needs healing are

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:06.040
 all merely the products of your own mind. None of it truly exists outside the mind. And having

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:11.440
 realized this truth, you can go on to develop the strong and genuine compassion that is

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:22.800
 Borichitta. So this is highlighting the importance of absolute Borichitta, or impermanence or

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:31.240
 shunyata, that it's all course is loving kindness and compassion, but it's also wisdom or prajna.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.120
 Borichitta always has wisdom and compassion, not just compassion. And without kind of really

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:45.920
 seeing the illusory nature of samsara, of suffering, will always be in duality mind.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.000
 And then we won't really fully uproot these causes of suffering. So I'm not saying I can

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.840
 do this at all. I'm just saying it's really clear in the teachings that Borichitta really

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:01.400
 has this relative and absolute side as well. And the absolute side is this is all my mind.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:07.920
 And if we go closer, my mind is pure. My mind is totally flexible. And all these powers

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.360
 and capacities are just, they're fundamentally a part of every single moment of my experience.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.880
 And I just have to connect to them and let them do what they do. In other words, be natural.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.440
 So this Borichitta resolve, just to say, I mean, there's a lot of ways to unpack impermanence

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.640
 in Borichitta. I thought to pick out a few strong statements, because sometimes we can

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.280
 just think, oh, impermanence, of course. Oh, Borichitta, of course. But when we really

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.380
 look at the teachings and what we're asked to do to how to really ignite this in our experience,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.760
 and that we're looking out, there's so much suffering. And inside, there's so much kind

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:51.660
 of movement all the time that really try to bring to home, what is this impermanence?

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:57.840
 What is Borichitta? Why is it such an elixir that really solves all the problems? How does

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:04.020
 it lead us to non-duality or beyond the limitations of our duality mind? That's a really real

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.160
 question for practitioners, because we're not going to stop samsara from being samsara.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:15.080
 It's going to always keep being samsara. But if we see more clearly, then the opportunity

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.000
 for Borichitta to shine on really happens. And then we can really integrate all of our

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.360
 activities with dharma. And that becomes not just a fairy tale or a nice thing to say,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.360
 but actually a lived experience, that all these noble beings, we have the great fortune

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.920
 to be around. They're living embodiments that that is possible. That truth is not some fairy

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.560
 tale. It's not some mythical thing. It didn't just happen a long time ago. They're living

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:46.080
 embodiments of the dharma right now. And so to end on on a high note, I want to talk really

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.520
 just read this Garland of views, the eight great bodhisattvas. This is such an inspiring

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.920
 book. This is by Mipham Rinpoche, where he goes over each of the eight bodhisattvas and

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.880
 pulls out sutra teachings about their activities. And it really if you want some really so powerful

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.480
 impactful bedtime stories, and just things to connect with all these life stories of

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.560
 this noble eight bodhisattvas so strong. They're so inspiring what they did and what they're

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:20.400
 doing. So to end on a high note, not just be like, Oh, this lie, I think of this life

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.200
 all the time. So I'm not a true spiritual practitioner. Okay, I think of that like that

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.160
 all the time. But then we have to look at the power of Borichitta. What are we talking

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.720
 about? When how does it remove all the causes of suffering? We should really highlight the

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.360
 benefit of enlightenment, the benefit of the dharma, not just the downside of samsara,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:47.400
 but also the goodness of seizing the opportunity. So here I go to the chapter on Avalokiteshvara,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.120
 who is also the source of the 37 practices of bodhisattva. I mean, really this. So this

00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:05.880
 goes into the chapter of Avalokiteshvara, the all seeing one, page 169. One could count

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.280
 the number of drops of water in an ocean by removing it drop by drop with the tip of a

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.520
 sorry, with the tip of a hair. If it rained heavily and continuously day and night for

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.840
 a year or even 13 months, one could still count the number of raindrops fallen in that

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:29.120
 period. One could not, however, measure the aggregate of merit accumulated by a single

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:37.680
 recitation of the six syllables. If all the men, women, boys and girls in the four continents

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.920
 became bodhisattvas on the seventh level, the aggregate of all their merit would still

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:52.600
 be greatly exceeded by the aggregate of merit gained by a single recitation of the six syllables.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.280
 Even if millions of tatagatas were to describe it for an entire deva-kalpa, they could not

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.900
 enumerate the aggregate of merit gained by a single recitation of the six syllable awareness

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:09.860
 mantra, "Omani Pemehung." What need is there to say that I, a single tatagata, abiding

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:19.280
 in this world and unable to do so? "Omani Pemehung." "Omani Pemehung." "Omani Pemehung."

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.440
 "Omani Pemehung." The power of our Dharma practice is just immeasurable. Doing the

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.000
 dudrum tarsar and nundra together, turning our minds toward the Dharma when it's such

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.600
 a decadent age that's trying to turn our minds away from the Dharma all the time, just moving

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.080
 a little bit towards bodhicitta, highlighting bodhicitta once. "Omani Pemehung." Just saying

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:45.400
 it once, just longing for Dharma, wishing one day we could go on retreat, let alone having

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.840
 a daily practice, coming together into some video, disembodied, two-screen live webcast

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:57.240
 thing. We're doing that and we keep doing it. And the benefit is so significant. We

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.680
 should really highlight that. Thank you for showing up. "Omani Pemehung." "Omani Pemehung."

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.880
 May we keep showing up together forever and ever for the benefit of all beings and really

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.500
 seize the opportunity. I really appreciate it. Thank you. And all this is a reminder

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:18.200
 for my own mind because I'm just so burdened with samsaric activity, samsara and all the

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:25.120
 causes and afflictive and everything. But I know, ooh, time's short. I know that every

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.960
 now and then I remember. And bodhicitta, every now and then I remember, that's the whole

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:35.840
 point of this. Bodhicitta, right? So if I can bring those up in my own mind, "Oh, I have

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:41.360
 a minute. I have a minute to do the mani mantra. "Omani Pemehung, omani Pemehung, omani Pemehung."

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:47.040
 That is a life that's worth living. And that minute is so vastly significant. And we should

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.920
 not forget how significant even a moment of turning our mind towards the Dharma is. So

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.280
 really thank you all for showing up. So glad to be in this together with you all. Yay.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.080
 May we do it forever. Thank you.
