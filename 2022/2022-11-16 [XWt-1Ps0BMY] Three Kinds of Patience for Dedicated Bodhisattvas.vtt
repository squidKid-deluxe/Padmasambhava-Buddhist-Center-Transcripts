This teaching became popular in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training are some of the most profound and effective practices for us to apply in daily life. They bring greater balance and harmony to everything we encounter. Mind training is widely practiced by Tibetan Buddhist masters and practitioners. It is a great practice of nonviolence and peace that powerfully ushers us straight ahead on the path of enlightenment.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training emphasize the practice of bodhichitta, the ultimate remedy taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava to entirely remove self-absorption by skillfully caring for all beings with boundless wisdom.\n \nSeven Points of Mind Training\n \n1.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720
 When the harm doing, the patience of the "nevermind attitude" towards the harm doing, and the

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.920
 second

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.440
 is the patience of all the difficult hardships we experience.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:28.120
 Third is, it is known as the patience of the hardships for practicing Dharma.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.200
 So those are the three passions.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.480
 First passion is, I translate it "nevermind".

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.680
 So "nevermind attitude" when they make the troubles, or difficulties, whatever they do,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.240
 do that, "I don't care, I don't care, I nevermind, I'm not going to pay attention".

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.200
 I mean, if it's a kind of verbally or something distant, immediately something happens, of

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.720
 course you have to permit in a low view practice. I also said that we have to be very sensible

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.080
 with more common senses, we have to prevent those things. But the deep, down heart will

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 not get anger. The anger is, in the Buddha teaching said, one of the very violence, violence

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 and a negative, negative, it really destroys the joy and peace, happiness, right on the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.440
 spot, not dead, behind the scene, according to the Buddha teaching, it destroys so many

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.120
 marriages, married a tree behind the scene. On the front line, it destroys the peace,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.040
 happiness, harmonious, friendship, bone. Even with friendship and this happiness, peace,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.480
 and we kind of build up for years that met so long time. But when anger comes, it really

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:00.600
 smashes that, that. And then behind the scene, I said, "See, it really destroys the marriage."

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.240
 Very powerful, powerful. So sometimes in the teaching he says, there is no powerful, negative,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:18.360
 then anger, and therefore there is no powerful antidote of dharma than the patience. Patience,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 so patience is so powerful, it's not patience, that doesn't mean that you're keeping that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.800
 in heart and become resistant in the teaching. He said, "You shouldn't keep that. You release

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.760
 it. We have open heart, open mind, let it come, let it go, blow the eggs." It's really

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.160
 that. That is, then is not kind of something old, then increases. Love and compassion and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.440
 bodhicitta and love-being practices increase. And that's the reason that I have to be warriors.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.600
 Actually, the bodhisattva, the love-being practice, bodhisattva, jitta practice is in

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:06.160
 the Sanskrit, is known as bodhisattvas. Bodhisattva means warrior for the enlightenment. That also

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.600
 indicates it's not kind of like lala journey, a journey of lala or easy, and just say everything

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.120
 kind of and so forth, so forth. It is hard because we are going to work for all the living beings,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:31.920
 and not just for one year, two years, but eons. And in the teaching he said, "The duration of the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.480
 eons and the eons and the populations of all the sentient beings to remove their suffering,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.920
 the difficulty, troubles, their challenges, and bring them to the enlightenment." So therefore,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:54.480
 our courage, bodhicitta, is vast as sky, deep as ocean or infinite as sky. Keep that. That is known

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 as the warrior to the enlightenment warrior to the both both
