00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 Thank you very much everyone, thank you. Thank you for coming, as I said. Welcome everyone.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 Again, we are going to do our beautiful Samye Ling retreat for two weeks.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.250
 This is one of the very, again, beautiful occasions and making for using our time, our disparate

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.440
 time, for very good purposes.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.760
 There are so many things to do in life. Everything is important, one after another.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 But deepening our spiritual or inner value, inner calling, the nature of our own beings is one of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.640
 the most important.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.560
 According to Buddhism, this is the most important because it will last.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:59.870
 Whatever we do in the world, everything won't stay as you want it or as it is. It's always changing

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.400
 and shifting.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 When we leave this world or when we leave this world, also everything is behind.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.410
 No matter how much you are accomplishing in the world in the world, whatever you do, everything

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.600
 will happen.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 And when we leave, according to Buddhism, but I say to you, you all know this, this will go where

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.640
 we develop with our nature of the mind.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.760
 Mind is always complaining or complaining with us, but not body, not speech.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.560
 Mind goes with us. Whatever we develop with mind, that goes together.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 And that is the spiritual or the Dharma practice, touching to our own best.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 Love, kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, exploring that goodness as much as we can do.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.440
 That much, it will shine and benefit in this very lifetime when we are having difficulty troubles.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.440
 But that is not ended. That will continue to go in life, up to life according to the teachings.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.920
 So today we came here, using all our beautiful, beautiful, important precious activities that we

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 have to do.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.690
 You left the world on the side and came here to do practice of all the breath deep in our

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.040
 connection to the Dharma.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.520
 That means Dharma means what actually? Dharma means our own goodness.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.960
 Dharma is not something that object outside we are trying to overload ourselves.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.900
 We knew carefully what is Dharma. Dharma is nothing but love and kindness, compassion, joy and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.480
 relax, calm and peaceful.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.400
 Calm and peaceful our body, calm and peaceful our mind, calm and peaceful our energy. Relax.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.320
 And what reflects the beauty of the world then? Not just it's become the miserable politic.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.880
 What do you often hear in the very unachieving, even in my unachieving, samsara is a nirvana.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.320
 There is no difference. Reality helps. Why they say that?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.960
 Because when you really click the nature of our own goodness of the inner mind, the nirvana or the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.320
 bhulin is right here.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.800
 It's not something that we are lacking of that or shortage of that.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.920
 Everyone really did that. And where did they do that? They are not coming from outside.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.270
 According to what I am teaching, according to all those great masters who actually had the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.000
 realization,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.760
 everyone said, "Drew inwardly." They were loving the nature of the mind to reword that.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.600
 Dispel the headiness, the obstacles. You are not allowing to see the goodness of our nature of the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.000
 mind

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.760
 and the goodness of the worldly phenomenon. This is obscuret. That is the end. Obscuretions.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.360
 Obscuretions are also not created by someone in our Lord to us. It's one's own creation.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.480
 According to the greatest teaching, bodhaka kamalu. It is all our correctness.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.200
 And what we have to do? Clean. Nobody also will come to clean that and purify that.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.280
 That's what nobody can do. What the greatest teacher, bodhaka kamalu said,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.840
 "I showed you the technique. I showed you the technique. Not sure. I was sure. I showed you the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.360
 technique. Now is your time to put that in action." And bodhaka kamalu, bodhaka kamalu,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.640
 did a long time ago to us. Their love and kindness compared to us. For all living beings,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.040
 it's just like this. Really, the teaching said, "They always love as their own only child."

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.080
 The Buddha's love, the Buddha's compassion. "I'm going to pay my son's love and compassion."

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.320
 All the whole enlightenment, love and compassion, caring and concerning thought to us is the same

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.640
 as their own child. We are like the kids. So they will do long time ago if they can.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.080
 But they cannot do it because it's one's own craziness. One's own mess that we have to clean up

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.480
 by ourselves. Ourself. So therefore, the greatest teacher, bodhaka kamalu said, "I showed you the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:36.240
 path. I showed you the path. Now is your turn to put that in action." If you like to work to clean

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.080
 and make better, you should do it. If you don't care too much, then don't do it. Yes. That's all

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.360
 it is. If you do it and you work hard with joy, so joy and appreciation, courage and commitment,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.880
 your effort, truly enlightenment is right here. It's not just shared and owned and kind of reserved

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:06.800
 by certain Gurus. It's open filled. Nature is with us all the time. But today we came here to

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.440
 explore

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.040
 that qualities, that goodness. And we already did. I mean it's not something that you'd come just

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.600
 today,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.920
 but we're already starting that. Today we're deepening that qualities. Reactivating that qualities,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.120
 goodness. Restarting that qualities. Bring more beauty and shine of that qualities. That is the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.720
 meaning, the purpose of the retreats. That is what really reaches. So bring to do that. Bring calm

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.800
 and peaceful. Relax. This place is of course, there's many beautiful retreat centers in the

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.240
 world, in this country. Parpe Masamil, where we are, is one of the beautiful retreat centers

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.360
 in this atmosphere, where this is part of the world. Truly it is. All the qualities, indications,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.520
 whatever the history, if you read the books, what they say, it has all this. What is missing here?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:08.160
 The great master material, material, the future Buddha what Ashenka said in his teachings,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.560
 what is the perfect qualification of the retreat center? He said excellent places,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:45.280
 excellent companions, excellent comedians, and excellent assistants, I think. Maybe I'm missing

00:07:45.280 --> 00:08:00.800
 one of those. Excellent land, excellent place, excellent places, excellent land, excellent places,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:10.880
 excellent comedians, excellent companions, companions, and excellent facilities, I think that's it.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.480
 Those are the really call it of the the the the hermitage. Perfect call it the hermitage.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:28.800
 Excellent places means, the place there is not going to create the disturbance, particularly

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.080
 related to Vivekananda elements, such as like sicknesses, disease, and all that. That is so,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:45.920
 is perfect places, perfect places. There is no harmony, also there's disturbance, well can easy,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:55.040
 cannot come, cannot come easily. So that is called excellent places. Excellent land or the area

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.640
 means that there is also not so many disturbance of the of the such as in the daytime robbery or

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:09.040
 the nighttime robberies or the wild animals and so forth. It's also very excellent land.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.600
 And excellent convenience, there is always a possibility available. If you need some help

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.080
 and assistance, it's always help, help a lady and help us. An excellent companion means the same

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.640
 same practice, same people that who share the similar philosophy, similar with similar caring

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.000
 thoughts, caring thought, okay caring and practice. So they have similar kind of view, similar

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.880
 conduct,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.480
 similar idea, similar thought, so there's no conflict in the back and forth, like I think that

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.800
 that is similar. And then excellent also convenience, generally kind of peaceful

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 convenience or beautiful places. Beautiful places, in the days nothing kind of during the daytime,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:02.880
 there's a lot of noise in the days, in the nighttime also calm and peaceful, peaceful.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.800
 So those are the really great master, right there I said, the qualification of the retreat land.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.480
 So this is the perfect location of the retreat, one of the best of the retreat locations,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:20.720
 this is old facility, modern facility, everything really common. So when we're thinking of those

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.280
 things ancient times, hermitage is not everything as what we have now. And all that convenience is

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.760
 easy. So now since everything, and then teaching the practice, you all made so many great masters,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.240
 received teachings, one after another, really today you came here to reactivate it and re-glorify

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.960
 that some really belonging that things. So these old teachings, which is that really put in action,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.440
 which is wonderful, beautiful. This is one of the, as I said, beautiful moment in our lives

00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.080
 that we're using very, this very precious time for beautiful, really purpose, beautiful reasons.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.600
 So those are the what it is. Then the other thing of the Buddha teaching, generally all teachings,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.840
 there's the Buddha give what we need in enlightenment at 35 and until 82 or 81. One,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:21.040
 He gave a lot of honorary teachings, and those teachings are sometimes named as 84,000 teachings.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.880
 84,000 teachings can be summarized in the 12 excellent teachings. 12 excellent teaching can

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:36.400
 be summarized into three basket of teachings, three basket or they know some of them, they know

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:36.640
 some

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:46.160
 teachings. These three basket of teaching is then what is the meaning of this or what is

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.520
 those three basket, of course many of you already know that. But three basket of teaching is known

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.680
 as

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.600
 Vinaya teaching, Sutra teaching and Abhidhamma teachings. So in generally all that teaching,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 the 84,000 teachings, all teachings of the 12 excellent teachings, or another way kind of

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.080
 according to the Jnana level, level nine Jnana teachings, all that can be summarized in these

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.600
 three basket teachings, everything in the three basket of teachings. Why is named three basket?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.160
 Because Vinaya teaching is not just one single teaching, it is group of teaching. So this,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:36.240
 that means that the Vinaya as the basket for that whole variety richness of the teaching, group of

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:44.320
 written teachings. Therefore, it is named or manifold basket of teachings, which hold so many

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:54.160
 precious jewels, gems of the structures, hold as like basket, like sasmi board or trail box,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:02.880
 trail box. So Vinaya then said with Sutra and Abhidhamma, these three, three of them.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.520
 And what are the principles, contents and meaning of these three basket teachings?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:18.960
 The essence of the, Vinaya teaching is moralities, congruence, ethics, essence,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.000
 essence of that teaching. And what are the essence teachings of the Sutra?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 That Sutra teaching essence is teachings on the concentrations, meditation,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.240
 meditation and concentrations. One of the teachings on the Abhidhamma essence of the Abhidhamma

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:50.080
 teaching, it's teaching, it's known as wisdom teachers, teachings on the westerns. What that

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.040
 means the wisdom, and that's bring exactly understanding of the subject and objects,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:04.720
 all relative truth, absolute truth, exactly as it is. Not highest stated, no lower stated,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:13.200
 but just the way things are, as it is, on the relative level and the absolute level, in the

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:23.440
 both levels, exactly as it is. That is the wisdom teachings, wisdom teachings. And Vinaya teaching

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.360
 is also not just the only congruent, congruent teaching, it combines all that three basket

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.160
 teaching too. Vinaya has Vinaya teachings, Vinaya has Sutra teaching or concentration teaching,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:44.080
 Vinaya has the wisdom teachings, and Sutra has also the morality, ethics teachings,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.640
 Sutra has the meditation teachings, Sutra has the wisdom teachings. Abhidhamma has same thing,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:58.480
 it has also congruent teachings, ethics teachings, and meditation teachings, and wisdom teachings.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:07.680
 It is, just each of those are really like, as I said, three boxes, all goodness. What it does,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:16.960
 all those teachings, it brings gentle, peaceful, our body, our speech, our mind, calm and peaceful,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:26.480
 relaxed, body is relaxing, energy or the speech is wind is relaxing, and mind is relaxing. When is

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.560
 relaxing, what is happening? It is bringing the deep, the call to true nature as it shines,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.280
 as it is, without understood by the mundane constructions and the duality publications.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.840
 It's exactly that it began to shine. That is really the meaning of all these teachings.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.240
 That's what the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakta Munna, gave all those teachings. Among those

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.450
 teachings, during this retreat, what we propose, of course, we all know, is teachings on the Vayay

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:57.680
ana

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:05.390
 teaching. Vayayana teaching is also in the within, as I said, three basket teachings, Vinaya, Abhid

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:05.760
ha,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:13.280
 Sutra, Abhidhamma. On the other word, it is morality teaching, and meditation teaching,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:21.200
 and wisdom teachings. It is, it's not just that Vinaya teaching is all left out, all concentrated

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:27.520
 teaching left out, or it's the only Vayayana teaching or the wisdom teaching. No, it's all combined

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.520
.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:35.360
 The target is to our, bring our nature of the mind, bring on the nature of the, our way of the

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.720
 body is, nature of our speech is to your head is, to bring that up. It's not, not covered by,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:51.680
 by the publication in the duality. Therefore, Vinayana teaching contains all that teaching.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.520
 It has Vinaya teaching, it has Sutra teaching, it has Abhidhamma teaching.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:04.000
 That's how the beauty of the teachings, all teachings are aligned up with Buddha's teaching.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.600
 The dear one is teaching, and just before Mahaparin, all lined up to discover our goodness,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.000
 our nature. Nature of the mind, nature of the phenomena, or nature of the subject

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.880
 and logic, exactly as it is, as it is. So this time is teaching on the Vayayana's.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.800
 Vayayana teaching, of course, you all know, is considering one of the most powerful

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:42.000
 skill, means teachings. "Buddha ever give," correct teacher, "Buddha Chapter many ever give is soul

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.480
 spirit." Why is it targeted to the right part of the enlightenment? Not just the partial

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.600
 enlightenment,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:56.880
 full circle enlightenment. Enlightenment of the related truth, enlightenment of the absolute

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:04.080
 truth. All enlightenment of subject, enlightenment of object. Not just the only one there is.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:12.800
 This full bloom teachings of the true nature, as it is, or the enlightenment. The enlightenment

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.400
 is not again somewhere else. Enlightenment is with us, with you, with me, with you all,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:28.080
 to reveal that qualities, that nature to the inner Vayayana teachings. Any Vayayana teaching

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:35.040
 also has a many variety of teachings, as you all know, out of tathara and at the other teachings.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.680
 But this time we're going to focus, I mean not just focus, our teaching is best upon the inner

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:49.680
 and other teachings. Another teaching is what really distinction between, again,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.880
 the outer tathara and at the other, just a really simple literature, simple literature

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:02.720
 tell. Outer tathara is, is bolder to save, actually, to get enlightenment. But outer tathara

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:10.320
 has more external activities to approach or to discover the absolute enlightenment nature,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.360
 or the our enlightenment nature. And in the inner tathara we're going direct to that nature,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.680
 more target, the book to the bold's eyes. Otherwise, all teachings are the same,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.520
 to get the true nature, as I said earlier, and you all know that. So this time is inner

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:34.880
 tathara's teachings. It's less kind of like external activity, direct to the enlightenment.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.760
 Inner Tathara teaching also has three different inner tathas. Those are Mahayoga, Anayoga, and

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:48.480
 Atayoga, as you all know. And again, they are nothing completely different from each other.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:56.880
 What then doki teaching said, Mahayoga is the foundation, Anayoga is path, and Atayoga is

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:06.160
 result. Anayoga is foundation tathara, Anayoga is path tathara, and Atayoga is result tatharas.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:14.960
 So they are the ground of foundation, path, and result. Don't know if the goal ever used,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:22.160
 the ground of foundation, foundation, and application, and achievement.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:31.040
 Atayoga is an achievement, result. So those are all on it. And this time is the essence of the

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:39.600
 teachings of the three inner tathas. Mahayoga, Anayoga, Atayoga, and Atayoga, as we will focus.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:49.520
 Red-witted higher girdwai and veggie vahras. And higher girdwai and veggie vahras, among the five

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:56.800
 dhyana buddha, is the pima family. Five dhyana buddha have five dhyana buddhas, and veggie

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:04.720
 buddha family, veggie family, renna family, pima family, karma family. That, I think basically,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:13.920
 you all know that. We all know that. Higher girdwai is the principal family of the pima family,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.680
 ob-bhema family. This is the pima family teachings. This is the sukdha-bhi. I have higher girdwai,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:26.660
 and veggie vahras, the pima family, is Amitabha's family. All of us are family. And we are pima s

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:26.800
ambha

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:33.120
 family. Same. Our local church already is a family. Thar are families. And so it's the same.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.000
 They are all in the pima family group. Even though they are, again, these five families are not

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.600
 completely different from each other. It only highlights the principle of the quality of

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.720
 nature, of the way things are. The nature of the way things are.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:56.240
 On the ultimate level, these five families, why? Those are five wisdom. Five wisdom, dharmadha

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:07.280
 wisdom, and mental wisdom, and economic wisdom, and discrimination, or distinct awareness,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.800
 distinct understanding, awareness of wisdom, and all accomplished wisdom.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.920
 These are the five wisdom. That is the nature of our mind.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:25.040
 That is the nature of our consciousness, your natural mind, and our nature of our mind.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.480
 Nature of our mind. But these Buddhas are represent of those different aspects of the

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.200
 nature of the qualities. Colleges, so pima family, is represented more distinctively,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.720
 distinctively understanding everything, the exact way things are, that awareness of wisdom. All

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.400
 some rather translate discrimination, awareness of wisdom. And the thought can't be this,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.440
 discrimination, awareness, when I'm thinking more, and a little bit more kind of talking,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.800
 that it's not something you discriminate against. I want that, I don't want that. It's not

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.200
 discriminate. Just see things, I think, like this is. I mean, you know Niki better. It's not

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:16.560
 discrimination. So that is the pima family. Pima family is one of the leading families.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.760
 That means pima family is one of the most borrowed family that connects to the practitioner,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:28.240
 and brings enlightenment within these large towns. That is according to Vajrayana Buddhism. It is

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.480
 true.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:36.800
 And for example, in Vajrayana Buddhism, everyone talks about abhadakti, talks about Amitabhas,

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:44.640
 talks about Gurubhema sambal. That's how powerful, how powerful, how banish, banish into the heart

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.600
 of the enlightenment, the brain, the realization. That means removing obstacles, diseases,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:58.650
 handiness, and then obscurations, and re-reverting that nature. So today, or this week, we are

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:58.800
 going

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.160
 to connect the concentrator to this practice. We are really trying to make this more meaningful,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.510
 more simple, and bring more joy and appreciation. And we are talking with both each other.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.000
 According

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 to Buddha's teaching, all those great masters, the lineage of practical masters, said everything is

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.800
 the best of both each other. We are doing this literally, not just only for ourselves, but to

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.760
 bring joy and peace happen. But really, what we are doing together, made this brain joy and peace

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.440
 happen. It's to the world. And the kind of great shine, the wisdom or discrimination, or the

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.920
 distinct understanding, knowledge, the wisdom shine. So everybody respects each other. Everybody

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.520
 knows

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.480
 the value and the importance and the preciousness of the everyone's life. Peace, respect, and

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.200
 effort. So therefore, calm, peace, and no more violence. Really, we should act. And that is our

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.440
 practice. Generating practice is all best on both each other. One way to turn, reaching both

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.920
 each other, actualizing both each other. Not just only the journey of a sudden practice. Wishing

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.120
 both

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.830
 each other for three times and three of them. That is just reminding. Our practice is, we have to

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.080
 do

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:17.520
 always, really. And this journey is received also. Really, we can make everything what I do. May I

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.760
 benefit, perhaps, all living beings. That may also include ourselves, our families. Not just

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:31.440
 all living beings, only for someone and not include us. Buddha teaching is what is called

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.120
 in teaching. It's a win-win situation. Benefiting to yourselves, benefiting from all the things.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.640
 With love, kindness, compassion, respect, and effort here, and a peaceful atmosphere.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:52.880
 And that is what the Buddha teaching is. Really. So therefore, bring up those old,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.080
 beautiful, intelligent, motivation, and make that this retreat, a sibling retreat,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:05.280
 energetic retreat. It's really, that's wonderful. Dedicated, that merits. Those old

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.560
 Buddha's Gita, the great master, the great master, they give to all us through all those tools.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:19.840
 Tools, both each other. And meditation, and dedication, aspirations. All those. So that is

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.840
 my brief talk today. And thank again for coming here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.560
 Thank you, thank you. Good to see you again, second. And meditation. And then tomorrow,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.200
 of course, we'll do the empowerment, the involvement of the higher giver and the

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:44.080
 Pradhyavarahi empowerment. And so then we go over to sadhana's teachings. And so that's the day.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.960
 In this afternoon, we're going to pipe with the bed. Something is really good, but of course,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.800
 So you all know that this...
