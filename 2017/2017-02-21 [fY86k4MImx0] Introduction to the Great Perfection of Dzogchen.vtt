00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 The ongoing movement of the six consciousness are liberated in the space, filled from the beginning

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.000
, and then there is bad coma, and are nothing other than that, filled from the beginning.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.870
 That is the principle and essence of the Dzogchen teachings. In here, again, we talk really about

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.000
 the Dzogchen teachings.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 First of all, Dzogchen is according to the Buddha teaching or according to all the great Masters.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 It is the ultimate teaching of the Buddha Shatyamuni, or the Buddha Samadhi Baba, ultimate teaching

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.000
.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Why is it known as ultimate teaching? There is nothing more higher or deeper than good to them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 There is nothing higher and deeper than them. It is just an ultimate statement.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 What that means is that nothing goes deeper and higher to them. There is nothing more than natural.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 Natural, there is nothing more than that. There is nothing more to discover than that and nothing

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.000
 more to go deeper than the Dzogchen.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.450
 There is nothing more than the nature of Dzogchen or Dzogchen. There is nothing more. It is an

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.000
 ultimate statement. It is a final statement.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 That means it is the final nature of our stuff, the final nature of everything.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 The final nature of everything. This nature, again, Dzogchen level, is not only outside, again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Dzogchen level, nature is only to you. And that is our nature of the mind, your nature of the mind.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.770
 Your nature of the mind, or our nature of the mind is what we have said here, pure from the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.000
 beginning.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 That is what is nature, pure from the beginning. There is nothing more to do, nothing to do at all.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 It is really pure. And what is said is pure.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 It is whether in the pure, every level, every level of that, and that is known as three caiyas.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It is pure dharmakaya, pure sambhokaya and pure narmakaya.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Your nature of the mind and my nature of the mind, everything is really pure.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 There is nothing really to do, therefore. It is pure, complete, nothing to do.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 For that reason, what is teaching? Relax. Just relax, really.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Just realize, why are you worrying? Why are you worrying? Why are we thinking all this?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.310
 All these publications, until the zogchen, all those teachings, from the first Jnana teaching to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000
 the third Jnana teaching, according to the Numa school.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.250
 All the basic Buddhist school teaching, Mahayana teaching, Awakanda teaching, Mahayana teaching, Aw

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.000
akanda teaching,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 the Mahayana and all those teachings are publicated. They are called zogchen poidos.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Publicated, it is all effort, not effort, not activities.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Nature don't have to do activities. Activities are conceptions.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:27.650
 Activities are discursive poles. Whatever we do, it connects with some relief of grasping and clean

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.000
liness.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 We have to release. Let's be in nature. So therefore, there is nothing to do, nothing to do.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Relax. Relax, what is it called? "R" and "R" and "R".

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 So let's relax and reflect. Let's relax and reflect.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 This nature of our mind is filled from the beginning.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Why is it called filled from the beginning?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 What obscurations are in there? If you look, where is ignorance?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Where is the anger? Where is attachment?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Where is all those negative emotions that we seek?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Even there is, where is joy and afflictions?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Where are those good things or bad things?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 This, right, the left, this, that. Where is that?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Where is this? This is, you look to your mind.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 You are talking about the mind now. There is your mind.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Where is this?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 There is nothing that we can identify and highlight there, anything.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Therefore, it is known as pure, completely pure.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Pure from the Dharma of samsara and pure from the Dharma of nirvana.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Totally pure, totally open, totally clean, totally vastness, totally epilogue.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 That is the reason, the pure from the beginning.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That nature is what is known as, as then, ordinary Buddha.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Buddha summon the Buddha. Ordinary Buddha and ordinary enlightenment promote your vistas.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Pure from the beginning and promote your vistas.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 This is right with us. It's never left us from the beginner's time until now.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 None is not going to leave us any time.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 This is our nature and this is pure from the beginning.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And that nature, this nature is known as, then, in the Buddha teacher or in the Dokti teacher,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 known as also another name, dharmakaya.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 That's dharmakaya Buddha. The dharmakaya Buddha summon the Buddha.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That is dharmakaya Buddha.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 This nature, that's something that we cannot grab by the dualities, grab by the conceptions,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 labeled by the conceptions. It's pure.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It is also grown of everything.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And it's that foundation. For that reason, say, oh, it's grown.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 It is that foundation. It is source of everything, yet there is nothing.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Nothing that we can identify.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 This is, again, this teaching of the Buddha and pointing out us to our nature of the mind.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 So it's not something that talking story, talking right now.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 You can correct that with your own mind, with your own intelligence.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 It's true or not.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.540
 This brain understanding of the kind of correct understanding is also important in the Dokti

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.000
 teaching,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 or not just only in Dokti, but in the Buddha teaching.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 When we meditate practice, we should have confidence. We should have certain things.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 We're not going to practice with lingering thought, doubt and hesitations.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And this, therefore, we should witness it correctly by ourselves.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Read your mind. It's true or not. Choose.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 When it is true, when it is, then answer.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 And answer your intelligence and what the teaching of the Buddha taught.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 It means it merges. It means it merges.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Then that's it. That's the what we do. Then we relax. We relax with that. That is known as

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 meditation.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Relaxing on that nature as it is without consistent disciplines.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Disciplines. So that is really known as Dharmukarya, as they say.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 For that reason, great Master, Master Gaurav Doji, who is first great teacher of the Dokti,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 or human teacher of the Dokti.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And what does the teaching say?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 "Buddha Shaktamuni gave the Dokti teaching, but not in the Buddha Shaktamuni poem."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 You get bold with that. The poem of the Buddha, some of the Buddha.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 The Buddha Shaktamuni gave the Dokti teaching.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 In the higher realm, this higher realm is known as Akanishta, in Sanskrit,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 which is known as not within dualities.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Buddha Shaktamuni gave this teaching in the poem of Samik Badra,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 in the pure land or the realm of the beyond duality.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Land of the beyond duality, or the pure land beyond the duality.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 In that realm, Buddha gave the teachings of the Dokti teachers.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Then Gaurav Doji is the first human Dokti teacher, Master,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 who came around 25 years or 27 years after Buddha Shaktamuni's Mahabharata in the realm.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And then, explore the Dokti teaching.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 You can see the Dokti teaching.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 There is the problem with some of the Buddha and as well as the Buddha where it starts.
