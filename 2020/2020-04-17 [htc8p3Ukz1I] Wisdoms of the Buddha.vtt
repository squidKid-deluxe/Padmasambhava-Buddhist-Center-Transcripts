00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating. Thank you very much for coming and participating.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And now we are all well and good, really good. And again, we have a wonderful opportunity,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 even in this kind of midst of the big kind of crisis in a way that has never happened in history

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 for a long time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And it's really happening now. All over the world, there is nothing partiality.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Almost all of it is just every way, equal, un-faciality is there, and very difficult and troubles.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.380
 So many troubles, one after another. So we're doing retreat, activating our spiritual energy and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.000
 inner qualities,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 our inner call of goodness. That's what gracious teaching, Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurabhayama Samm

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.000
amal, all the great masters,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.360
 mention one after another as one voice. Not just they're mentioning, but they achieve what they've

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.000
 spoken.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.570
 They stand up firmly with what they say. Is there something, saying something and doing something

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.000
 different? No.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 They're utterly, exactly lined up with what they spoke and what they're doing and what they did.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.780
 Therefore, principle is so absolutely beautiful. And that which is a touching to our inner goodness

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.000
, our qualities, our traits.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.760
 Many times we don't try to touch to our qualities, our goodness, because of the destructions of the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.000
 external,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 of the mundane world, we're always outside, kind of looking and searching.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 But this time, we're having some good time to reflect our inner qualities, reveal the goodness,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.020
 which is loving kindness, compassion, and wisdom. All the Buddhism thought, thinking of all living

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.000
 beings.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 We're doing something really wonderful, beautiful. And we should always dedicate this really wicked

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.000
,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 sincere benefit to all living beings. These old peoples were going through so much troubles.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 There were six who were trying to help and support to those sickness persons,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 who were staying what they called terminology from the lines.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 In a way, really the great Bodhisattva activated so many people's joy, all over the world.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Whether they have believed or not believed, but reflecting of their inner principle qualities

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and good things throughout reaching to benefit, support many ways, one after another.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And we really wish while we're doing this, doing retreat, reflecting the teachings on the Buddhas,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 practice meditating,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 and cultivating that attitude, thinking that to all, dedicating that for all benefits.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 This is our great kindness teacher, Buddha taught this, to benefit for all beings.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 The principle activity of the Bodhisattva is to benefit to the others.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 They are put the old others on the front than themselves.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Others are the number one, they are the second.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 When you read the books of the Buddha teaching, and when we heard the teaching of those great

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.000
 Masters,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 one after another, that's really true. That's what they did.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Those great Masters did a doing and practising. So we're following that footsteps.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And their footsteps are examples of our best capabilities in these kind of circumstances,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 in a way, for that situation here. And therefore, what great Master Gung-Hima said,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 "All the difficult troubles came that I've met Dharma, and I'm thankful to those difficulties."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 And all the suffering and sadness came, and I have to meet Dharma, and I'm thankful to those suffer

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.000
ings.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And all those negative spirits are, again, pushing me to the practises,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.980
 and I've got performant realisation, I think, to those unhuman beings, all those non-visible beings

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.000
 who did this.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 I mean, one after another, and one who has also encouraged me to practice, I got realisation.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.580
 I thank for all those who are encouraging me. And therefore, I dedicate all this merit to all

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.000
 living beings

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.090
 for their realisation and for their performance, and remove the suffering and the difficulty to

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.000
 every living being.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That's what great Master Gung-Hima said.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Truly, we're having this opportunity to activate that with all these circumstances.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So I'm really, again, I'm so thankful and so grateful, all of you doing something beautiful,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 something really good, meaningful in our lives, I think, in a way.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 We can remember this, what we're doing for a long time.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 A time that we can reflect about what we did together as retreats,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 and using the modern technologies into virtual reality, or whatever the name is,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 where we're doing the practicing, meditating as one mandalas, one circle.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And I'm so happy that we had these opportunities, and let it be encouraged to each other,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.680
 and aspire to each other, and extend our courage and commitment, confidence, and voltage that

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.000
 progress.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 That is what is known as performing the meaning of this very precious lives.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So, I'm so thankful.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Okay, thank you. Today, again, I'll go to the teaching,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 but we'll continue to follow with the teachings of the Jyoti of the New Rumuji, as you all know.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 As I said so many times, this teaching is very essentially called "Convencent"

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 and has the New Rumuji himself making his heart instructions to the fortunate ones,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 or heart advice to the fortunate ones.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So, we're doing this. We're going over this.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 And how we're going this? We're going slowly by slowly.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 In a way, reflected teaching to the heart and the mind.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 What is in Buddhism that's known as studying and contemplating.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And then meditating and practicing.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So, really, we're doing that a little bit.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Doing this little bit more, spending time, and when this thing, this.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And today, again, we are in discipline.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 On the sixth line, sixth line, and here, I said the other day,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 they highlight three points.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Three points, said three jewels.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Three jewels are then three jewels, and they are in valuable protractals,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 and then trustees.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 So, those are the three highlighted points in these lines.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And we're going again, as I said, many times, slowly,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 and going a little bit details.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And again, I said, what I'm talking is nothing new that you never heard.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 We all heard. You heard. I heard. We all heard.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 But this time, what we're doing is the repression of our memories

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 and reflecting so that we can activate that.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 That's really what we're doing together.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 So, slowly by slowly.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And now, we're going to talk again, these three jewels.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Among the three jewels, I mean, these three jewels are Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 I think that's what's known as three jewels here.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Here, let's have this.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Trusting that the three jewels are in valuable source of ruffles.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 So, this is the word in the teachings.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 I said, trusty is one. Three jewels is one point.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 In valuable source of ruffles is one three point.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 I said that.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 So, first of all, we're talking about three jewels.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Among that, these three point, we're talking.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 That's how I'm going to highlight that.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And the three jewels are Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Other day, what is Buddha, actually?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 What means?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Simply to explain what is Buddha.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And what in the teachings is the nature of the Buddha.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Or one way may be the identity of the Buddha.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Identity or the nature of the Buddha, the simple way you can tell,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 is one who will remove all the obscurations,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 the anything that is the entrance, completely removed,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 and completely achieved all the realizations.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 That means there's nothing higher to gain, higher to go, or deeper to go.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Or more, kind of, vast to find that everything is completely achieved.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 So, one completely purified, one is completely achieved.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 That individually is known as Buddha.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And then, as I said, there are many Buddhas.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 In the past Buddha, present Buddhas and the future Buddhas will come.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And there are also many Buddhas.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Those, as we all know, in the video and the teaching,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 peaceful Buddhas, wrathful Buddhas.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And those are all Buddhas that can be male Buddhas, female Buddhas.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 There are many determinations of the Buddhas that we know.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 But, say, nature is the same.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 One who achieved all the qualities and the good things,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 all the natures, all the offers, everything is completely achieved.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And it removed all the handedness, the obstacles.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 So, that is really what Buddha is.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 So, that is simple.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Then we went through those already, quite a few.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And so, I mean, all those descriptions of the Buddhas,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 we went and analyzed of the Buddhas and how we did this.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Because we said that the Buddhas and the Muslims

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 and the beneficial activities, we did kind of divided it three.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Buddhas are the best of the Muslims and the best of the activities.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 In a way, what that means? The Muslims and the Kayas,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 so, activities are best on the Kayas.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 In general, very simple way to tell, kind of roughly to tell that.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 That is how it is.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 So, what are those Kayas?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And we have made, you know, there is a poor Kayas or Buddhas.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 We have went there last time and of course, you all know, at the poor Kayas.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 And those are Soba Wakaia, Dharmakaya, Sambokaya and Nirmakayas.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Those we went.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 And Nirmakaya can be divided for the more supreme Nirmakayas.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Birth Nirmakayas or emanation Nirmakayas, maybe.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Spring Nirmakayas, emanation Nirmakayas, Art Nirmakayas

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and the variety or the varieties of the Nirmakayas.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 We went those.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Now, all that poor Kayas can also be summarized into two Kayas.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Often, we all heard that, known as Dharmakaya and Nirmakayas.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Dharmakaya and Rupakayas.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 So, these all poor Kayas, what we are talking, what I've been talking,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 is now summarized into two Kayas.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And that is Dharmakaya and Rupakayas.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 So, how that is, is Soba Wakaia is concluded within the Dharmakaya.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 So, Dharmakaya, when you say, sometimes we always mention three Kayas.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Or sometimes, two Kayas.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 So, Dharmas, Soba Wakaia is within the Dharmakaya.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 So, that is the first, number one Kaya.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And the second Kaya, Rupakaya, is, Rupa means in Sanskrit word, "homes".

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 So, in English, it's athletic poems, F-O-R-M.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Pong Kayas.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Pong Kayas divided into two, every second.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Pong Kayas, that also means, immediately you have to understand, it has two.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Sambokaya and Nirmakaya.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 In the variety, those Kayas emanate all that in the poem Rupakayas.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Pong Kaya or the Rupakaya.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Now, so therefore, the whole Kayas summarize within two Kayas.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Kaya is like hip, roughly Sanskrit word, Kaya.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Kaya, if we translate that into English, I think it's hip, H-E-A-P, hip.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Meanwhile, variety of the goodness are controgate as one, those one and the guy.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Pong is hip of the goodness.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Hip of the goodness, all the hip of the goodness, all the, yeah, hip.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So, that is Kaya.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 So, that is two Kayas, Dharmakaya and Rupakayas.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 And what is Dharmakaya, actually?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 In the teaching said, because when we are working for the enlightenment,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 when we develop the body together, always in the Buddha teaching mentioned,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 fulfilling the dual purpose, or fulfilling the two purpose.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Help to others, and when you help to the others,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 and you also help to yourself, it naturally comes.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 For example, how to use examples.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 In the wind captain or the sail, sails, the passengers in the ship or the boat,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 and the captain very tight to the cross, cross the river or the lake,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 of course, captain is taking, taking the passengers,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 but not just the only passengers, captain him or herself also going to the other side of the shore.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Naturally, its benefits.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 It is, therefore, it is win-win situation or the win-win news.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Once you benefit to the others, then also human naturally benefit is reflecting back.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Whatever we do, it really reflects back.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And that we can witness in the samsara.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 In the loving kindness and compassion, if we give someone,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 it brings peace and happiness to the others,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 but at the same time, it brings peace and happiness to us or the one who is given.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 At the same time, anger and jealous, hated thoughts or resentment thoughts that if we do,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 it also makes others uncomfortable.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 At the same time, individually, one who is initiating will get the tunnels.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So this is the way we really think.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And for that reason, great master, yogi, Mahasweta, Dhrupa Konlek,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 very famous, one of the very great yogis of the Tibetan Buddhist history

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 in the Dhrupa Kaju orders or the Kaju orders.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 He came to the, and his teachings said and the master said too,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 he will enter the central temple, very famous blessed cathedral of the Zhou temple,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Lord Buddha's temple.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 This Buddha is so famous for all Tibetanists.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 It is like represent living Buddhists.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Even many of the great masters always mention that statue is blessed by Buddha,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Shatyamuni, hence up, 2,600 years old.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And that statue is enrolled in the central cathedral of the palace,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 the capital of the Tibet.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 That is the focal point of the object of reference and object of pilgrimage sports.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 All the Tibetan Buddhists, so many people come,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 and so many great masters,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 realize that your beings, yogis, yoginis, great thetans,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 visited here all into this statue.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Sunrupa Konlek also came and went there.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And he said these words, words,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 "You Buddha reach, you are the, you have the tremendous endeavor or the joyful effort, effort.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And therefore you become the Buddha.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Because of your endeavor and joyful effort, you reach enlightenment.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And because by leading this, I'm still in the samsara.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So therefore, these leadiness beings are going to do possibly you,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 the one who has the joyful effort,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 one who has joyful effort, I pray, I pray to you."

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 So that's what I lead.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Shatyamuni's song, sing that song, and pay the homage.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 According to the very words which were taught that,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 it looks like he's kind of making jogs, jogs naked.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 But that's true statement.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Buddha, through his courage and commitment,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 endeavor, all the joyful effort, for countless years,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 and having benefited all living beings without any discrimination,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 whoever needed, whoever needed the situation, the circumstances,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 he are there, his emanation, no matter whatever his lives are,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 whether he's a bird, whether he's like animals,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 whether he's a princess, or whether he's a god, or human,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 learned, unlearned, whatever, or a turtle.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 He benefited to all the beings.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 That's what really his commitment, his joyful effort, reach enlightenment.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Total, become the Buddha. Buddha.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 And so therefore, when I say that, one who's really reaching enlightenment,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 therefore, I pay homage to you.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So that is really, because all this, when you do this,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 working for all the sentient beings, and therefore the Buddha reaches enlightenment.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Already, we sentient beings are still struggling in samsara,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 with our own creation of the dualities, activities.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Really, our own struggle, our body is ready to enlightenment.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 So therefore, we've called for following the two purpose, or the dual purpose.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 So these two kyas, again going back to the two kyas,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 this dharma kya is known as fulfilling, the result of fulfilling one's own purpose.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Therefore, Buddha achieved dharma kya.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And for following the purpose of others, even though Buddha reaches enlightenment already,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 but still sentient beings are lingering, struggling in the samsara in different ways,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 and they have to benefit all these living beings until they reach enlightenment.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Until they become Buddha, these emanations are known as rupa kyas.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Sambokaya and Nirmakayas.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And sambokayas are the ones who benefit all the higher realization beings.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 They are the body's sambokayas.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Sambokaya immediately communicates to benefit them.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 All those higher realization beings have the capability

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 to contract to this great sambokaya Buddha and this is the teaching,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 such as Amitabha, Vaidya Sato, Rana Sambokas, and Verojanas.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 All the Buddhas, all the many, many other emanations,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.360
 all many emanations of the five dhyana Buddhas, of the three five emanations of the five dhyana

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.000
 Buddha.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 There are so many emanations, they can contract that.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 For us, many of the sentient people who are struggling in the samsara,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 they are again Buddha emanated.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 This is the second decision, then rupa kya, when it's Nirmakayas.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 And all those as I listed the other day, and you all know,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 those four emanations.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 According to our capabilities, Buddhas are connected to those old things.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Whether it is Supreme Nirmakaya, or the emanation Nirmakaya,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 or the variety Nirmakaya, or the art Nirmakaya,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 one way or the other, they are connected to that and bring up their inner goodness qualities.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Starting with joy, peace, happiness, and love, kindness, compassion,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 and benefiting to the others, according to their readiness, help to the others.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 So that is really known as dharma, or a mrupakayas.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So that is really about gaya now.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 That we talk in our episode again.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Gaya and Varsitam, about the division of Buddha.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Gaya, Varsitam, and beneficial activities.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 I'm going like this, slowly, and talking this to all of us,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 a little bit reminding to you, and a little bit reminding to myself,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 so we can reflect and set the goal, what we are going to fulfill in our life time,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 or, really it takes time.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 We are going to discover this inner nature.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 That is our destination, our goals.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Now, toe above that, really above that, Varsitam.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 When you reach the window, you become the Buddha.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 You got the complete Varsitam.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Varsitam.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 This Varsitam is not just maybe miniaturized with things,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Varsitam is intelligence.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 But this Varsitam is not just only intelligence.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 It's loving kindness. It's compassion.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Its combination of that is known as Varsitam.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Combination of love, combination of compassion, combination of the intelligence.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 All that is known as Varsitam.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 It's all blended in, that.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And so that is Varsitam.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 How many Varsitams?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 There is, again, a simple way to tell the primordial Varsitam.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 One primordial Varsitam.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Or, the number "tam chen chen mihi" in the debate.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 There is Varsitam that knows everything.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 That is one, one mental expression.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 One Varsitam.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Then we divided the letter further.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Further, two Varsitams.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Varsitam that understand it perfectly,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 exactly as it of the Absolute Truth.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 And Varsitam that understand it,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 exactly as it related to Truth.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 So two Varsitam.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 "Chen tauan chen mihi" "Chen diabar zabihi"

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Two Varsitams.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 That is really the true Varsitam.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 One understand it perfectly,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 exactly, Absolute Truth.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 The nature, exactly as it is.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Why everyone understands it,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 exactly as it is.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Why I am talking exactly as it is.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 According to the Buddha's teaching,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Varsitam that see exactly as it is,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 that is the final, the knowledge that you have to develop.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And we are making overstatement, understatement,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 is not considering as a versusness.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 It is a misconception.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Misunderstanding.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 You see, gold as gold.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And, what is called that name?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Brass as brass.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Not mixed up.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 So, white as white.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Simple ritual.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Black as black.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Or yellow as yellow.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Not mixed up.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Once you see that,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 that is then ultimately understand

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 of the relative level where things are.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 So, that is what I am talking,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 exactly as it is.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Exactly.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Nothing higher state, nothing lower state.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 For that reason,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Nagarjuna said,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 "You spoke that among all the speakers,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 among all the teachers,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 you are the excellent speakers."

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Exactly truth.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Not covering up, not making anything.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Simple, rare as it is.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 That is what the religious teacher,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 brother, is.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Simple.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Right is right.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Wrong is wrong.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Negative is negative.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Positive is positive.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Virtue is virtues.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Not virtues, not virtues.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Or mixture is mixture.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Exactly things are explained.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 So, that is the worst of us.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Now these Muslims,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 they were more divided.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Nagarjuna explained.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 And then these Muslims,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 we all know, heard.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 The five Muslims.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Those are the Dhamma Dhamma Muslims.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And the Merulan Muslims.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Equanimity Muslims.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 And then discrimination,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 awareness Muslims.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 All the distinctly understaining awareness Muslims.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 You know, all accomplished Muslims.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Those are known as five Muslims,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 the year old.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Okay, so that's my talk for today.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And then, of course, again,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 we continue to think, okay,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 thank you very much for participating

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 and listening.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And again, we do your meditation talking.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Thank you.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Thank you, everyone.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Thank you.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000
