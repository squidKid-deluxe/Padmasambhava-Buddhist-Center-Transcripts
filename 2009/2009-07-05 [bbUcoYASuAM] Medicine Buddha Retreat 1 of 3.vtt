 "Again, we just thought that this is the Medicine Buddha's presence. It is the Medicine Buddha's

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:17.360
 pureland. We really have to bring up that confidence. And confidence means that we are not letting

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.600
 doubt and hesitation take over our mental status.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.070
 Doubt and hesitation is always doubt and hesitation. It undermines every situation and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.490
 circumstances in our even demanding lives when we do. When we have doubt and hesitation, that means

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.600
 we are not completely sure. We are not going to fulfill that.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.820
 But when you don't have the doubt and hesitation, then things come very different ways. In this

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.980
 time, this is why we have meditation practices, healing practices. We shouldn't let think that

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 doubt and hesitation is taking our practices.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.580
 And therefore, again, feel this is the Medicine Buddha's land, the pure land. This is the Medicine

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.230
 Buddha. And all these images is the Medicine Buddha's content. And ourselves, in that status, bring

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:22.900
 that confidence, that attitude, and then it will happen. It will bring the result of what we are

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 thinking or what we would like to achieve.
