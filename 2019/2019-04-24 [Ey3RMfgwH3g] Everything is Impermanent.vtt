00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 And in one minute I'm going to talk a more cognitively list today, and maybe go to the details

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 tomorrow, as you all know.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.200
 Both of those are listed in the teaching. The post is generally reflecting the whole universe of

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 the world is impermanent.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The universe's worlds are impermanent. That's the one.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Second, which is reflected, the world inhabited in the universe's world is impermanent.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Second, that is the second reflection of the impermanent.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Third reflection of the impermanent is all those holy beings.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.100
 Noble beings are also the subject of the impermanent. Holy beings, noble beings, realization beings

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 are all subject of the impermanent.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.510
 And fourth impermanent reflect what we reflect, all those powerful mighty force, mighty force,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.000
 powerful, mighty force are subject impermanent. Everyone.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 And then generally everything is impermanent, reflecting everything is impermanent. Everything is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 impermanent.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:48.530
 There's nothing is not impermanent. Everything. And then, now what? Fifth or sixth? Fifth? Fifth.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.000
 Fifth. Fifth one is dead, individually thinking.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.260
 Also individually our own self is impermanent. Our self is impermanent. It's not going to last

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.000
 forever. It's this. It's just our self is impermanent.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.750
 And the next one is strongly thinking of reflecting all that situation. Everything is how that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.000
 impermanent is really pervasive, pervasive to everything and that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 So, everything is impervious, pervasive of the impermanent. Those are what always in the teachings

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 are not for that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.990
 This is what, again, when we reflect this, with reflecting of the precious lives, with reflecting

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.000
 of the impermanent is known as meditation, particularly its mindfulness meditation.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.540
 You really bring up or will bring up the wisdom, that shine, not just living in a corner dark state

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.000
.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.800
 And then thinking of the impermanent in the teaching, always in the teaching, when you reflect the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.000
 impermanent, it's really great reflections, great reflections.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.420
 And what is Buddha's teaching? Buddha said, among all the conceptions in the thought, thinking of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.000
 impermanent is super, is supreme.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Among all the footprints of the beings, the elephant footprint is big, supreme.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.780
 So, he used the example. It's what it does. It makes, if I say it simply, when we think impermanent

00:03:47.780 --> 00:04:00.890
, it makes our heart softer, more tender, more softer, more kinder, more nice to each other, nice to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.000
 each other.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.230
 And that means, when we become more kind and nice and wise, when we become, then we become more

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.000
 also, more simple, happier.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.350
 And we're not going to struggle so much all the time. And we're not going to pick up small things

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.000
 and make big kind of pus, sometimes we do.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.890
 Plus, spoil whole environment by small things. Really, we do. Maybe we have the 80% perfect,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.000
 beautiful, 85 or 75, 95% good.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.110
 But maybe the 5% is something, you know, we make sometimes big scene of this. And then spoil

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.000
 everything, then become maybe 90% wrong, then bad.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 We do that. We all do that. Not just few people, but we all do that.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Because due to our kind of like legitimate attitude of thinking, spoil everything.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:22.340
 So therefore, this thinking of the impermanent is really in the teachings, so special, so beautiful

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.000
, so tender, all that.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.620
 So I just thought to talk about really that. Then I thought maybe little bit details of those

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.000
 things, each one, maybe tomorrow, that bit, of course we know that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 But those are the ones we should reflect always. Now with those understanding.
