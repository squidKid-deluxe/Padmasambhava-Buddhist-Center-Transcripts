 "And again, of course, Dzogchen teaching and Vajrayana teaching, the relationship of these two,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 two, is again, in what's called, inseparable. You cannot really divide it. Divide it because

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.700
 Dzogchen teaching is Vajrayana teaching and Dzogchen teaching is the ultimate Vajrayana teaching,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.040
 so

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.520
 they're really, like, without Vajrayana teaching, there is no Dzogchen teaching. For example,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.430
 Great Massen teaching, Padma Samye Ling, many times used examples of that. Dzogchen is full

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 teaching,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.430
 full teaching, full. And in this case, for example, he used examples many times, used as dollar

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 bells,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.040
 one dollar bells, it is one dollar. But if we divide it, there are a dollar, 100 pennies,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:06.480
 100 pennies. And without the 100 pennies, dollar won't become the dollar, dollars. So if you take,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.160
 if you are out of the quarter, nobody will say it's a dollar, dollar. Even 99 cents,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 people say, oh, it's less than dollar. So even 99 cents is not dollar. And therefore,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.800
 all these teachings are made, Dzogchen teaching as Dzogchen. Dzogchen is attributable, what means?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.760
 Great completion teachings, completed. What is completed? All the teachings are completed,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.920
 all teachings, samsara and nirvana are completed. All part and bhoomis are completed.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.440
 Everything is completed within these teachings, teachings, teachings, and which is our own

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.940
 Without this, the regular teaching...
