Meditation practice reveals our true nature as being totally perfect and complete. However, at present, in an illusory and temporary way, we are incomplete. Although we have many good qualities, we also have many obstacles.\n\nIn order to reveal this completeness, the most important things to work with are the body, speech, and mind. In Buddhism, these three aspects are called the three doors. Along with the three doors, we cling to other dualistic labels like \"he\" and \"she\" and \"I\" and \"you.\" Of all our concepts, the notions of having body, speech, and mind are always with us, so if we can make their activities positive, then we are performing dharmic activity. If we do not have the ability to make our body, speech, and mind positive, then we are in either a neutral or a negative state. (pg 7, paragraphs 2 and 3)\n\n2. Your present mind has a cause and it has conditions, and it will continue without interruption until you attain enlightenment. The continuation of consciousness through different stages is what Buddhists call past and future lives. Even though at this moment you do not remember your past lifetimes, or you do not understand how you were conceived in your mother's womb, there is definitely a continuation. You have come here now, and you will go on continuously in the future. It is similar to seeing a flowing river. Since the river has arrived at this point, you know it must be continuous. Even though you cannot see its source, you know that the river has come from somewhere and will continue to go somewhere. You have come from the past, from beginningless time. Now you are here, and your consciousness will continue tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, next week, next month, and next year. (pg 11, 2nd full paragraph)\n\n3. One day all of us will have to go through the stage of death; we have done it before and we will do it again. Nobody can ignore or run away from death. When we feel afraid to die it is because we do not understand the nature of death. Death is the separation of the body from consciousness; that is all. The body developed from the five elements and it will dissolve back into the elements, but consciousness did not develop from the elements. Since the mind is different from the elements, it will flow on continuously. (pg 12, 2nd full paragraph)\n\n4. Just knowing about emptiness is not enough to stop reincarnation. Mere intellectual understanding is not realization. According to Buddhism, understanding and realization are different. We may understand something, but we have to experience it to gain realization. For example, if we look at a map we can know something about the place we are going, but it does not mean that we are there. If we go there, we will experience something quite different from what is on the map. However, learning from a map is very helpful. Similarly, understanding emptiness is the first stage of realizing the true nature of the mind.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Welcome to the second PBC morning dawn study group from Padmasamy Ling. Today we'll be discussing

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 the second chapter of Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches book, The Buddhist Path, and the chapter is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.080
 entitled "The Causes and Conditions of the Mind." So first we'll do some opening prayers

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 together and then we'll go into that chapter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000

 [Singing]

 [Singing]

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 [Singing]

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 [silence]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 So I'll just begin by giving a brief overview of the chapter and so what we'll do is, so

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 we all have the same context to say more or less the essential point of each chapter,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 or sorry, each paragraph in this chapter. And then after that we'll have these, we'll kind

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 of begin to discuss these four main points that we've outlined to talk about. So the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 first chapter is making a vision between a grasping duality mind, and they say our nature

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 is perfect and complete, and in order to remove this grasping and reveal this nature, we have

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 to work with our body, speech, and mind. So our body, speech, and mind can either be positive,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 negative, or neutral, and so the practice is to have our body, speech, and mind be positive

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 as opposed to negative and neutral. And then the third paragraph is that the mind is

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 principle, and that we should check this for ourselves. Before a moment of speech, in a

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 moment of body, there's always a previous instant of mind. Fourthly, the tool to make

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 our body, speech, and mind positive always is mindfulness. Fifth, the mind is always

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 thinking about me and mine. And so it's important for us to investigate this mind that's thinking

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 about me and mine. And so Urbiches begins this by considering the relationship between

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 mind and body, by asking does mind come from body, does mind come from these five elements,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 or does body come from mind? Then they go on to say that I, the sense of I, is nothing

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 but grasping. So what is this grasping? The grasping is the mind. So then they go on to

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 discuss, well does the mind rely on the body? And they answer, no. Does the mind come from

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 speech? That's a ninth paragraph. And they again say no. And so then the question becomes,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 well let's investigate thoughts. Let's look at this mind itself. And so then they go to

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 analyze, well this present thought that is happening now, it comes from a past thought.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And so the question is, well is this, so in this present thought if we look at it, does

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 it have a cause or not? And if it does not have a cause, then this present thought would

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 have to be permanent. So they deduce that this present thought must have a cause, and

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 this present thought comes from the previous instant, which comes from the previous minute,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 hour, day, year, all the way down to the moment that we're born. So then that takes us to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 the twelfth paragraph, and they say well how did we develop as a baby? How were we born?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And so here they say that the mind was the principle cause of us being born, and the

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 supportive conditions, the supportive causes were the two elements of our parents coming

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 in. And so this draws the conclusion that this life that we're in now will eventually

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 turn to death, will die, and that after death there will be a period of this after death

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 bardo. Following that will be a new life, which will then end again and have an after

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 life experience bardo. And so this is a constant cycle that we've all been going through.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And so this is the reasoning behind past and future lives and Buddhism. Then they say that

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 this duality mind will continue this way until enlightenment happens, and that non-grasping

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 enlightened awareness will be fully revealed at that point, and then once this grasping

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 is removed, once this enlightened awareness is fully revealed, then we'll never be forced

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 by karma to take rebirth again. They go on to kind of continue to tease out the logic

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 of this karma for life and to death by showing how when we look at things that causes produce

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 similar results. If we look at results they come from similar causes. That goes for both

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 physical causes, making physical results, and mental causes producing mental results.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And that understanding about this system of cause and result is exactly what brings inner

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 wisdom. So then they go on to say that one day we will die, and understanding how our

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 mind and body interact will actually greatly help us when our body dies. And then just

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 stubbornly believing that nothing happens after death is just that, stubborn belief

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 about something that we don't know. Then the 19th paragraph is that when the body stops

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 or dies the mind continues, so they go on to talking about the eight consciousnesses that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 make up the mind. And that these eight minds or consciousnesses have habitual tendencies,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 and that these habitual tendencies happen even without a body, and the example that

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 we can think of is it in a dream. Then the 21st paragraph, the habitual mind is forced

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 to reincarnate due to its habitual energy, due to its habits, and that this non-grasping

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 awareness isn't forced to do anything, so it arises spontaneously in a way that's

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 most beneficial for helping others. And following that, just as knowing emptiness is not the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 same thing as actually realizing emptiness. Similarly, having a map is not the same thing

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 as actually traveling to and arriving at our destination. And so then they say, well what

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 is it that causes this rebirth again? It is our grasping. And that this emptiness nature

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 or dependent origination is in fact what allows things to change, and this grasping is actually

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 what refuses to see this. Then ignorance is what blocks our true nature from fully functioning,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 and then based on this ignorance, we don't see the infinite flexibility of our body and

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 our mind. And then also, then we don't see the natural qualities of that mind rising,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 so we don't see our own qualities of Buddha nature happening. And this is likened to

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 hearing and darkness, and that if we continue this ignorance, we'll never be peaceful because

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 we won't have a balanced mind and we'll constantly be tossed around on the waves of our karma,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 so this samsara. And so then the final paragraph, they go on to emphasize that ignorance itself

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 is temporary and can be removed, that this is an important point to really take to heart,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 and that by understanding the cause and effect of ignorance and wisdom, that by understanding

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 this cause and effect will become enlightened. And so another way to say this is by understanding

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 the Four Noble Truths, the cause of samsara and its resolve, and nirvana and its cause,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 then we'll eventually become enlightened. And that's the chapter in a very bullet-pointed

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 way, so beginning there. So then we'll go to this first topic, and you read that on the

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 journal? Yes. Meditation practice reveals our true nature as being totally perfect and complete.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 However, present in an illusory and temporary way, we are incomplete. Although we have many

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 good qualities, we also have many obstacles. In order to reveal this completeness, the most

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 important things to work with are the body, speech, and mind. In Buddhism, these three

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 aspects are called the three doors. Along with the three doors, we cling to other dualistic

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 labels, like he and she and I and you. Of all our concepts, the notions of having body,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 speech, and mind are always with us. So if we can make their activities positive, then

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 we are performing dharmic activity. If we do not have the ability to make our body, speech,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 and mind positive, then we are in either a neutral or a negative state. Anybody have

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 any thoughts? It's like you've seen some things you see that you don't make a judgment either

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 way. Would that be something similar to a samadhi, or could a samadhi have a neutral

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 state of mind, or just the act of samadhi cultivating that one-plenty of concentration,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 or a similar state? Is that by its nature positive? I don't think it would be so much

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 as if, generally, a samadhi would be concentrating the mind. I think working with the body, speech,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 and mind as a virtuous activity would be cultivating samadhi based on a good motivation, and then

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 neutral might be sitting in a chair. It's neutral. Clonically, it's neutral. It's not

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 like, "I am going to sit in a chair for a," so anyway. Walking down the street, looking

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 up, or like seeing, or going, coming to the conclusion that you can't affect something

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 in a positive or a negative way, and by stepping back from it and realizing that you don't

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 have any influence on that. It might be positive, though. Are you talking about more of an apathy

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 point of view? Is that something you're saying? Not necessarily apathy, but just the realization

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 of being aware of the situation, and that you don't have an effect on it either way,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 positive or negative. Realizing that your input wouldn't be valuable in that situation,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 so stepping back because you're a neutral influence. Sometimes that could be skillful

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 means. I think, according to the teachings, usually when I say neutral, it's like sitting

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 in a chair, walking, something that doesn't have a strong, volitional action that's either

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 positive or negative. It seems like that's something. That's a nice neutral activity.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 That's completely unique. And I think something too that also affects karma is how aware we

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 are at what we're doing, and how we feel about what we're doing, and then how we feel while

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 we're doing it, and how we feel once we've finished doing that. So that also could go

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 with neutral to a certain extent, too. But then, in regards to this, what do you all think

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 about as far as how this positive activity relates to some of the other points in the

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 chapter? Like I'm thinking about karma, and the neutral and negative.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Do you have a thought that maybe is positive or negative that creates karma just as much

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 as, less than or more than, doing something specifically with your body itself? I'm curious

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 to hear what people think about that.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 From what I've heard, I think on one level you would say that mind is what happens first.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 I mean, that's what happens before speech and action or body. But I've also heard that

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 once you've acted, you've decided to say something to someone, you've been thinking

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 about it, and you decide to say it, then that's stronger that you actually said it, so the

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 speech, or whether it's an action, I think that's considered more karmically effectual

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 as a stronger effect.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 If we always have this body-speech and mind, that maximally using that would be the best.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Positive mind, positive speech, positive body. And in that moment, as much as we can be,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 all of our things, all of our, we're fully activated in a positive direction, and all

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 of these body-speech and mind are coordinated with one another.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 So it's an integration of all of those, and being here and mindful of that. Because something

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 may come in your mind, for instance, you may be angry. And you may not act on that, you

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 may not say something to somebody, you may not do anything specifically, or you might.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 So if it's in your mind and then it comes up as part of Buddhist practice, you're mindful

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 of that, and then you have an impact on that before it turns into something else. But there's

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 still a karmic impact. The anger still has arisen.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Well, it's not as great, I wish I had.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And that's what I'm getting at, because is it karmically more or less, or does it even

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 matter whether you have a thought, maybe you don't do that, and then you turn that thought

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 on? I think if you do it, if you do something about it, that makes the karmic propensity

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 stronger. But if you don't act on it, you still have to work on the mental piece, but

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 it's not, in terms of karma over time.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Because karma is activity, the word is activity, isn't it?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 It's activity, yeah. But then also the sense of result, cause and result, results and causes

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 and causes and results, and one thing leads to another.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Would you explain those four aspects of karma that you went through?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Like the object, the attention.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 So is that related or one more time? Yeah, it's just related. And then too, also

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 with what Doug's saying too, and how we kind of touch on that point of the 12 links, but

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 definitely our karma is also how we're perceiving things, and then how we label them, how we

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 think about them, everything we relate back. So that's one level that's happening in the

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 mind level. And then there's our tendency to grasp at that, whether it's just actually

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 grasping at the thought, but then of course when we then also engage with our speech and

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 or our body to somehow try to interact with that and deepen that grasping, then that is

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 perpetuating further seats of results. Like what we're experiencing, what's coming up

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 to us is the results of previous things that have been sown kind of seats coming out, reflecting

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 back out from deep within our consciousness. And then how we then try to, this whole process

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 of grasping is what perpetuates it. So it's happening on the level of our mind, on just

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 the level of perception in a way and conception, and then of course then how we relate to our

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 body and our speech in regard to those things. And then the Buddha said in regards to those

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 four points is what makes a karmic activity more or less powerful is how we are aware

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 of it, we are in the first place, like if we think about practice or anything, we think

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 about it and we're aware we're going to do it. And then if thinking about doing it we

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 have like a desire to do it or not do it, how we feel about doing that is also adding

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 to the karmic. And then how we feel and where our mind is while we're doing it is another

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 thing that's making it stronger. And then once we've done the activity how we feel about

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 doing it makes it more or less strong too. So for instance if we see something and we

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 have a really strong feeling and we just go right for it and we act upon it and we feel

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 really good or righteous or whatever while we're doing it and we feel great about it

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 once we've finished and that's a really strong action, it's a full complete action whether

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 that's something virtuous or positive. Ideally it's positive but obviously then so that's

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 the extreme of like really it's a powerful karmic and then so then there's other combinations

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 we could think of. If something comes up we don't want to do it or do it to our mistakes

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 or our laziness or our whatever. We do it but we're not really into it when we're doing

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 it and we don't feel good after we do it. You know what I mean? It's still strong but

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 maybe it's not. Or like there's examples about like say being generous but the reason you're

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 being generous is so people will think well of you. Right. You know or raises your status

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 to the community and you're a donor. Do you know what I mean? So then the karma really

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 gets very mixed up in terms of it's positive but it's not really maybe it's even more

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 negative than positive because of your motivation. It's conflicting and it's mixed. So we might

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 have a positive action and with that action we actually go towards neutral and even negative

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 depending on how we do that. I think just from what you said Liah just reminded me of something

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 you said about how important it is after we've done something good and positive to really

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 reflect on that and like oh that was a really good thing. I'm just saying this because it's

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 something I forget to do and I feel like it's really important to do. It's really, oh that

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 was something really good like acknowledging that you did that. It's a good thing and really

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 aspiring to do it again. And just thinking about that process you know like the positive

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 as we're trying to cultivate that in our practice and you know just really to reflect on that

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 oh wow that you know even a little thing that was something good. You want to be careful

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 not to veer into the hole that was something good. Great. Wow. It's a charitable kind of

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.780
 thing. I think you're making a good distinction when you need to. Acknowledging. Yeah. Acknowled

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.000
ging

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 with that being. And acknowledging too just shows too the power of when we acknowledge

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 our mistakes to the other direction. When we acknowledge that someone else has done something.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Yes. That piece of the acknowledgement and the karmic effect of that. It's like oh really

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 it's so wonderful. Yeah. Rejoice. Has this energy and they're putting it into it. They're

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 you know they're giving of themselves. It feels like, oh I'm sorry. It feels a little

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 bit like this is starting to go into the second topic. Yeah please. I'll just read the particular

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 intro sentence. Your present mind has a cause and it has conditions and it will continue

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 without interruption until you retain enlightenment. I had a specific question if anyone wanted

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 to speak more to it about you know it talks about how the mind has the causes and conditions

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 and then it says until you retain enlightenment. And I guess maybe if we parse out more of

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 the definition of mind and why is it that the mind is considered part of enlightenment

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 because that's one of those things where at first I remember when we first came to this

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 book and we were discussing it last year I kind of went wait what? Like the mind's gone.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Okay. Someone tell me what that's like. If someone could speak more to that. Well I'll

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 jump in a little bit. First of all it says your present mind. That's a good distinction.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Yeah right. So you know we do purification practice. So what do we purify? You know we're

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 talking about the different ways that we behave in the world as a result of our thoughts.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 So it's just this process of cultivating more positive thoughts and actions. Right? So at

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 some point the causes and conditions just simply stop arising. And that's like the totality

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 of a path. But at some point there's no more karma. Okay? So at that point then one has

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 total awareness from the absolute view. I have to be careful how I say that. Yeah. But

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 it's a different state of mind. It is the natural state of mind. So it's kind of like

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 you know we know that. We've discussed this a lot. That we're just working towards opening

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 that Buddha nature, that awareness, that true state of mind. And that particular state of

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 mind has no causes and conditions. That is pure. I don't know if that helps. Well that

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 does it. And this part of this depends on what level of teachings, like the answer of

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 what is mind and what is the absolute state and what is the nature. Even what is the nature.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Because the first sentence of the first topic, which is really kind of bam, meditation practice

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 reveals our true nature as being totally perfect and complete. Which even though we've heard

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 that a lot, but it says we have a true nature, that nature is perfectly perfect and complete

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 and we reveal that. Basically what determines what is virtuous or unvirtuous is whether

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 or not it leads us to the understanding that our true nature is totally perfect and complete

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 and we see that. So you mentioned like Buddha nature and you know the causes and conditions

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 of mind. Well from a certain level of the Mahayana teachings the mind would be mind,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 consciousness, all these other things. They talk about the eight consciousnesses and aggregates

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 and all those different things. But Buddha nature, like the cause of the whole shabang,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 samsara and nirvana, I mean ultimately is like they say throughout the chapter, continuity.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Continuity of awareness, like the continuity of mind. Buddha nature recognizing, you know,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 making the six realms, you know, I mean in a certain sense just the ongoing experience.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Like one master here said you'll never be out of, someone was concerned about death.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Basically they were afraid of dying. He said oh don't worry, don't worry. You'll always

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 exist in the universe in some way. But his point was continuity of experience. Or like

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Robert Thurmond, it was interesting when he just once little fun thing. He said when I

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 was translating the Tibetan book of the dead, you know, as it's commonly known or he said

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 you know I came to an interesting conclusion while translating the Tibetan book of the

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 dead. There are no dead people. He's like maybe everyone else already knows that. But

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 it's ongoing. So it depends on how you define death. You know, if by death you mean mind

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 is ended, Buddha nature is ended, awareness no longer experiences. So I'm sorry Nirvana.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Then by that, that doesn't exist, you know, because it doesn't end. It just keeps going,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 you know. But I don't know. Anyway, I just like this.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.660
 Let's kind of think of that goes right into the third point, so I don't know if you want to go

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.000
 there.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 You know what I'm talking about.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 So that's the rest of the second point too. Not the river continuing.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 It definitely so here that that mind is related directly. The mind that continues until you

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 attain alignment. So that's definitely this distinction they made in the first chapter.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 This book taming mind. There's conditioned mind. There's unconditioned awareness is two things.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Conditioned mind has karma. That karma can either be negative or positive. So there's

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 negative karma, positive karma, and mind that's not affected by karma. Three things.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 So what we're trying to do is not create more negative karma. Actually do good things

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 with good intention. Even if we're holding anything, it's karmic because there's a

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 sense of I holding. It's karmic. There's mistake happening there, me doing something.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 But if it's positive, it leads towards the lessening of negative karma, the increasing

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 of positive karma, which is called accumulation of merit, which then actually leads into

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 the wisdom or like how the mind is when it's not affected by karma. So in the end, like

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 you said, it leads towards the absolute state or the mind of enlightenment, mind beyond

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 karma. That is like how the mind is when it's no longer influenced by karma. So that's

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 enlightenment when literally all the causes suffering or all the grasping totally eliminated.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 But then they also said in that first chapter, we can have moments of being an awareness

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 that's not influenced by karma. And so one way of looking at this too is like how Rinpoche

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 said, right at the beginning of this, like to connect with that nature that's not influenced

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 by karma, that's right here, right now, the Buddha nature, and then reveal its qualities

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 by not having the grasping come up at the same time. So non grasping awareness. So it's

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 not as if mind just out like you said, end of mind over game over, you know, but it's

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 like end of grasping dualistic suffering mind, like, and all the oppositional circumstances

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 that that produces, and then just open receptive, inclusive awareness, that doesn't have any

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 particular fixation or something like that. That's the path is to change the condition

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 of karma to where we're trying to eliminate the negative aspects of it that arise in the

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 mind and to make it to a pure state where it is just a positive flow and then it doesn't

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 take a form because it is just one continuous. Or just that whole practice of accumulating

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 wisdom and accumulate merit. And in a way, like we've talked about it many times in Rinpoche's

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 too, how like that aspect of accumulating merit is in a way positive grasping. For sure.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Creating positive conditions into which to move on the path towards totally ripening

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 up our primary nature. As we become more and more familiar with that.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 But I'd say in the end too, it doesn't mean that the form part ends, like just because

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 I mean, it goes through these chapter, just because we die and the body dies and then

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 it's just mind. That awareness always has an energy or an expressive capacity. It's

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 always form and emptiness, emptiness and form, like a core foundation of Mahayana teaching.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 So it's not as if awareness ever happens without any kind of expression, even if that's a really,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 really subtle expression of mind or thought or something like that. It still emanates.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 So even a Buddha, like enlightened mind here, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden there's

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 zero body or form and then it's just some disembodied mind. But that mind then will

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 have a capacity to spontaneously express itself in ways that are helpful and that can take

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 the appearances of forms and all kinds of shapes and sizes and the condition has been

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 changed to a positive aspect of it. It doesn't, the negative aspect of karma doesn't appear

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 there because it's not necessary. Yeah, the negative is certainly gone. Then it can be

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 just pure expression or like wholly, wholly positive expression or something. Unkarmic,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 wholly positive, super-cadro-fragilistic. Yeah, I think that's a really important point too

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 in terms of making sure that the absolute is not equated with blankness, but that there's

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 always going to be some manifestation. That, you know, the Orm Caias are always there with

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 the Dharma Caya. There's going to be, it's just like some expression or some manifestation

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 is going to continue to happen and so we don't sort of think that we're trying to get to

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 some place where there's no perception and there's no activity and no anything. That's

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 not the goal. And that's impossible. That's, I mean, that's totally like you said, like

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 we're always relational beings. We're always related, you know, there's no point where

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 we'll, you know, like someone said, it's like we're all like kind of locked in an elevator

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 together forever. So we might as well get along with each other, that sort of thing. But

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 I mean, I'm sorry. It's a, it's a, it's a, but the, but the point is like, even if you

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 recognize that there's no like rippages here, these labels, me, I, mine, you, me, this,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I'm sorry, nirvana, like even if you, like you said, grasping mind is what, is enlightenment

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 is no more grasping mind. That's a simple way of putting it. No more grasping to the

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 label of you and me and like, cause otherwise it can sound like, you know, like the state

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 of nothingness or like for the bodhisattva perspective, like, oh, that's a lot of work,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 you know, like, but you're always relating, you're always going to be in this form with

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 an energetic component of mind and it's going to be bouncing off, you know, it's going to

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 be affecting things and things are going to be affecting it in a certain sense. So it's

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 like, we can't, I think that we, you know, they say we have eternalism and nihilism are

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 two such big habits, you know, that we have like nihilism, they define it as different

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 things, but the wish for this to end, the wish for, I'm sorry, you know, for the troubles

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 and the difficulties to like, just be over, just end, just black out, you know, just whatever,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 or the wish that, the wish that we last forever, that our good circumstances could last forever.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 But I think, you know, non-grasping mind of enlightenment is beyond all those extremes,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 you know, that's what they say, all the labels and so it's not like, now I will attain

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 enlightenment

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 and that sense of like, well the enlightenment is recognizing that this grasping to the sense

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 of I-ness as a separate thing that's not relational or that is what has dropped, you know.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 That's kind of interesting.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 I had a wonderful loan pretty much saying, but very close to what you're saying is over

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 on page nine in here, something, if you look on page nine, it's the second full paragraph,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 the I, quote unquote, exists when we start to form attachments. The I, again, quote unquote,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 is nothing other than the grasping itself. I love that word, it's the grasping itself.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 That would just sound like such a, love that part of it.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And they sneak it in here even in this first topic we already discussed.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Of all of our concepts, the notions of having a body, speech and mind are always with us.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 So here, even talking about body, speech, mind and these things, they too are ways

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 that we're constantly holding, our mind is constantly holding what it feels that it is.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 So strong, like, and they say these are things, three things sentient beings always have,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 body, speech, mind. So that's interesting, but they're here, they're just concepts too.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 So this is little Mahayana, I mean, this shows it's a Mahayana for sure.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 They've already established Buddha nature, and here they're establishing too, it's all mind.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 I mean the way of phrasing it specifically is that kind of a philosophical position.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Anne, when you were talking, you used the word perception, and what came to my mind is,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 and I think we were discussing this in our study group that was in between these two,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 and that was, in Rinpoche's book, they said to refine our perceptions.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Is that right? That struck me so strongly, because we have such a misperception of this reality.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And part of this process of the conditioned mind moving towards the awakened mind,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 knowing, if we can say it that way, is refining our perception.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And that kind of, like, tickles me. It's like, oh, that's interesting.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 It's a different way for me to look at this than I've ever looked at it before.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:05.650
 And it happens so much through organization practice, right, that we begin to see things

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.000
 differently.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 These are not as they appear.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 I don't understand what that means, to refine your perception.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 What would that look like?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 So, Kendra, which we said in the Nine Golden Chariots,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 it was like the end of the chapter on samsara, question and answer,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 and he said, part of the path is we need to refine our perceptions and conceptions.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 He was defining absolute and relative truth.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 It's not as if we can just go into absolute truth, because if we could, we would have done it.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.230
 Actually, I have to work with relative truth, and how we work with it is like having more accurate

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.000
 conceptions,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 more functional, inclusive conceptions, perceptions, and that leads towards non-conception.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 So, that refining.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 So, I was just going to mention, because we talk about enlightenment and what's on the other side.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 But here we are, right?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Maybe it is I.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Most of us have all these issues.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 So, to me, the whole idea is you have to do practice, right?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 To open the doors to be able to get there, right?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 And they talk in the mirror about having a map and having a destination.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 And we can sit here and intellectualize what we think is that state.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 We've spent a lot of time doing that.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 More that we can think, okay, it was that I can do, and to Liah's point, you build a merit.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 That's probably what opens the doors, and you have to have a leap of faith.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 And if you build merit, things will happen, and you'll start to perceive things differently.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Not because you're trying to do it, but you're presented with what you really already have, right?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 So, it's not so much trying so hard.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 So, the idea is when thoughts come to, we talk about grasping, and visualizing a thought coming,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 and not acting on it without thinking, and just doing things, and whatever happens happens.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 But say, oh, let me just take a moment and recognize that this thought is coming by,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 and do we give it power?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Like Liah said, do we act on this?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Do we give it more power, more power, more power?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Spend our week just totally focused on this thought.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Or do we say, that's kind of interesting.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Say, what's next?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 And you kind of do that, and that gives you a little experience of not grasping.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.810
 It may be very limited, but it gives us a practice that says, okay, I'm going to start to see what

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.000
 it feels like to not grasp.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 And you do that, and then you mindfully do positive things.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 And then you think, I'm not doing that.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 I'm not grasping it.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 It goes, oh, what a great thing.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 I just did.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 But you say, hey, this is, you know, I'm building this mirror, and this mirror is the key.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 This is the key, and it's not just my key.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 It's everybody's.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 And you build it.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 You share it with everybody else, and we all move to a point.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 And all of a sudden, the things appear, the fog lifts, and you see something.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Not because you willed it to happen.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 You know, you just relax and allow what's actually there to show itself.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.810
 So that thing to me is like, it's helpful for me to understand what practices can I do that will

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.000
 help me get there.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Because I really don't have a clue about what's out there.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 I can think about it all day.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 I can read a lot of books, and I do, and it's important.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 But walking into a building you've never been in is different than looking at it in a picture.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 You know, touching it, and feeling it, and being part of it as part of this.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 So it's interesting to me that they do talk about that.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.740
 You can think about it, but you're not going to just jump from, oh, I get it, and I'm going to walk

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.000
 over, and there I am.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 It takes work.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 It seems like that's a lot of, like, that whole point of refining.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Like, I mean, it's only one level of, like, examining reality.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 And then there's all the non-yanas of exploring reality and becoming more familiar with how it is.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 According to the capacities of how we see, and each level refines a little more.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And we're actually using our faculty of intellect to really examine our assumptions.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 And according to that level, look at reality.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 And we're using those tools.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 We have all this study and instructions.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 And then, too, that whole balance between just thinking of our prep, you know, hearing, reading.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 And then we're all discussing and thinking about, and then there's our actual meditation practice.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Those three study, contemplation, meditation.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 I mean, I'm just thinking of what I'm thinking about, saying what I'm thinking about.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 It's not a point or anything.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 It just seems like the beginning of refinement, for me, is to be mindful of your own thought.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.920
 If you can be mindful of that, that, to me, is the beginning of refinement, because then things

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.000
 will start to change.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And you're refining, and you're thinking, and you're meeting things.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.690
 And like that whole, I mean, it's beautiful, too, just that whole first chapter in here is on t

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.000
aming the mind.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 And then leading into this next.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 So it's just interesting looking at that progression, too.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 And Rick, what kind of progression?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 The progression in the way the chapter goes, from chapter one, looking at taming the mind.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 And then those parts, and then looking at causes and conditions of that mind.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 And then kind of how this, you know, the conscientiousness, alertness, mindfulness.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 That's such a critical, it seems like that's what you're talking about.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Just a critical point of being aware of what's coming up.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 So you're kind of polishing and doing some things, and that's at least a start.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 You know, and I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but I don't really care so much.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.070
 It's like, it's the roller coaster, even if you're starting to go down the hill, and you're just

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.000
 relaxing.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 [laughter]

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 I had a comment about one thing you said that was that the leap of faith of accumulating of merit.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 But I don't, I mean, and maybe it is to begin.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 To begin anything is a leap of faith, to some extent.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 But as far as when you're actually accumulating merit, in your, like you said, in your mind,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 you are refining that, you know, your perception through mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.810
 And you're accumulating virtuous things, like in this first point, which means you're moving

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.000
 towards something.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 But, you know, Buddhism says there is good and there is bad.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Good is, I mean, from one level, one level of the teachings.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 And at that level it says that the nature is actually good.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 That's the actual, what the Buddha said when he attained enlightenment.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Whoa! You know, the nature is freedom. The nature is freedom.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.270
 So he's like, everybody wants to be happy, that's what Buddhism always says, and Tibet Buddhism

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.000
 always says, every time.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 The basis of the whole thing, everybody wants to be happy, people don't want suffering.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 And the nature is actually the freedom state.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 So the leap of faith, I think, in this case, is just trying it out, like trying it out, beginning.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Like, see, what is mindfulness like? Like, really, what is it like, you know?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 And that's like moment to moment, try to engage in that, and then you might find, you know, I mean,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 like we all will.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Oh wow, like, the leap of faith gets less and less and less and less.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 As the grasping diminishes and one travels the path, there's less and less faith in the sense of

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 you don't have to take anyone's word for it.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 It's going to define what you mean by faith right now.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Faith, and faith meaning, like, you have to believe in something that you don't experience yourself

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.000
.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 Because by following the path, you will experience that.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 And when you do virtuous activities, you'll have many friends.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.020
 And, you know, when you have good motivation, like, you'll have friends, you'll have good

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.000
 circumstances.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 It doesn't mean bad things can't happen to good people.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 But that's based on Kama, how we've been doing this since beginning this time.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Things are coming up and we're purifying things in all different circumstances.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 But I guess I just mean that, like, the Buddha always said, some teachings says,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 "I'm asking you to believe what's in this palm of my hand."

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 But that is not my teaching, this is not the Dharma. This is the Dharma.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 That hand is open. You look, I mean, the Buddha, he said that.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 You must examine that for yourself, like an open palm, you know?

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 You see that for yourself, don't take my word for it.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.800
 Like we said, I think last week, maybe, you have to examine the teachings as a goldsmith examines

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.000
 gold, cutting, rubbing, you know...

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Yeah, it becomes experiential. I think you have more and more...

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 And that reinforces you as you see that.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 Yeah, it's like a momentum.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 That point is exactly what is in this fourth point.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 I mean, you keep kind of going around it.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 I just wanted to say, I really like what you said, Doug, because, like,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 it's like you're saying, let's take the foreignness out of this practice.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Like, I'm going to read these books and, like, look at...

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 All of this just ties well together. Look at the map and not go in the building or whatever, you

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 know?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 But you just really touch it. You get into it.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.800
 And then we have this, like, we take our understanding for what we read in the book and we develop

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.000
 that and we work on that.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 And it's not just this pie in the sky ideal that we just never engage in, you know?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 So maybe I'll just read the point you have to use.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 "Just knowing about emptiness is not enough to stop reincarnation.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Mere intellectual understanding is not realization.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 According to Buddhism, understanding and realization are different.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 We may understand something, but we have to experience it to gain realization.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.780
 For example, if we look at a map, we can know something about the place we're going, but it doesn't

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.000
 mean that we're there.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 If we go there, we will experience something quite different from what is on the map.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 For learning from a map is very helpful.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Similarly, understanding emptiness is the first stage of realizing the true nature of the mind."

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 So does that mean that in order to realize that you don't have to be on the boomies?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 On the boomies?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 I don't think so. I think here there'd be this...

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 Why would you think so?

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 Well, because realization, there's an understanding, an experience of emptiness.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Yeah. So first boomy would mean you're no longer forced to karmically be embodied in samsara.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.210
 So you're free of samsara in first boomy. So that would be enlightenment in that bodhisattva

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.000
 context.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Yeah.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 But first boomy is when you fully understand emptiness.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 No, when you fully realize it. We should just keep the terms straight here.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:09.100
 It's good. Experience, understand, realize, or intellectually understand, experience that meaning a

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.000
 little bit,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 and then realization is stably, uninterruptedly abiding in that realization.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.980
 So we intellectually understand what it is, then we actually experience it, and then we always

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.000
 experience it.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.100
 At least for that particular thing, then we have realization of that particular meaning or

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.000
 something.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.810
 So I think we can have experiences. We can have glimpses. We can have moments when things are clear

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.000
.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 That's different from realization.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 Right. In terms of the realization is defined as stability.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 It is that way. And so what was your question again?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 I was wondering if realization, if you can't have realization without being on the boomies.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 I see. I think that if it's defined as stability, it's got to be that way.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 And the answer is it depends on how you define realization.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 No, because it's a really interesting point. From the sutra perspective,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 they say that you don't have a direct experience of emptiness until you're on the boomies.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.360
 And then from a vashriyana level perspective, they say that because they're specific skillful means

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.000
 practices,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 like, for example, receiving empowerment from a great realized being,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 they can provide such a special set of totally balanced conditions

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 that that skillful mean particular to the vashriyana

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 can actually help us have a direct realization of emptiness in that moment.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 Whereas the sutra perspective doesn't think that's possible.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 You have to stably be on the boomies to have that.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 The vashriyana perspective says that is possible.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 If you use with this certain motivation, in the presence of a vashri master,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 everything's set up properly, then that direct realization is possible.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 But it still has to be stabilized. There's no way around that.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 They would say, I mean, I don't know what we're going to call it.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 Maybe to keep you in the terms, will we say experience of that realization

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 or experience of emptiness, maybe?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Or the way I've heard it talk like, even say in terms of nature of mind practice,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 you can directly experience nature of mind through vashriyana,

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 but that doesn't mean you're on the first boomie.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Do you know what I mean?

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 It's just that skillful means allow you to start to experience that more and more and more.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 But it's not the same thing as first boomie.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.020
 Be careful, because you think you can see the nature, that doesn't mean you have attained

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.000
 realization.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 So there are really different things.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 But the vashriyana does have these skillful means,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 so that we can train in zotian and start to experience that directly.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.170
 So when you're using, you actually would say realization is different from having a monetary

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:04.000
 experience.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 That's the way that I've heard it.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 In terms of like a zotian or Mahamudra context, it's a different thing.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Because you can still be having that direct experience.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 That would be the experience of a realized being, but it's not stable yet.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 So it takes quite a while.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 [laughter]

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 So it's interesting, you keep using the word stable.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 I've always thought about it as being completely integrated.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 That one, at that point of realization, would see the emptiness completely and totally,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 and it not come and go.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 But I've always just thought of it in terms of being fully integrated.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 But maybe using the word integrated, then there's still a sense of body-mind.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 I don't know, I'm just kind of thinking out loud here.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 Because I had never thought of it in terms of stabilization before, not that way.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 But it makes perfect sense, it really does.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 You'd stably have an experience of emptiness?

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 It would just be uninterrupted.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 If anger arose, I guess that you would see the emptiness in the entire situation

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 in such a way that it would not draw you in.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Do you understand what I mean?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 I don't have that experience.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.230
 Maybe you're saying with integration you can think of it as that idea that form is always there

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.000
 with emptiness.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 There is an integration in the sense that it's not like you're just having an experience isolated.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 But it's always integrated with the manifestation or the expressions that are happening.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 In your moment-to-moment life, like they teach you to say,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 waking the daytime experiences, the nighttime experiences, the dream experiences,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 when you maintain the uninterrupted awareness of the nature of mind

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 throughout all those experiences, then you're completely enlightened.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 Like I heard a vocal organ of one of his grandmother.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 She said, in conversation with her teacher one time of her realization,

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 she said, "Well, that's a special story."

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 We only have a few minutes to say.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 She said four minutes.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 She said she missed for a couple of moments right after she fell asleep.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 She lost recognition of the nature of mind.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 And then she instantly regained it before the dream started.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 So maybe we've touched on this third point, the concept of the idea of death.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 We're going to die. It's coming. We don't know when.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 But we kind of really haven't done it.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 And it's so good to look at it.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Is there any way that anyone has something that they'd like to share about that?

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 We have about a minute and then we have to do meditation.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 So now's your chance.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Death.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 I did touch on it earlier.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 In terms of Robert Thurman talking about how the more he works with the bharga-tudha,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 he realized he'd never.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 There is really no death because that continuity of experience or awareness

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 is always ongoing, although it's hard to see that.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 What we see is the body's dead and the consciousness is not there.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 I like this. Just in this quote here that it's talking about,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 it's because the body is composed of the five elements

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 and the mind is not composed of the five elements.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 So then the elements are changing. They're constantly changing.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 And they have these natural patterns and transitions of birth, death, and death.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 We can tease it out into further patterns, but at least the big ones, birth and death.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 The mind is not susceptible to those changes.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 The mind is not the form of aggregate.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 The body and the material is the form of aggregate.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 The duality mind is totally susceptible to change.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 Our habits constantly change.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 But it's non-habituated, unconditioned, non-grasping mind or awareness.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 That doesn't change.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 But otherwise habitual mind is like that, that, that, that, that, that.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Monkey mind, you know? So that changes all the time.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 So would you say, in here, there's a five element,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 and then what would you say the mind is made of if it's not the five elements?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 It's uncom pounded.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 Uncompounded? It would be habit patterns?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 Not wisdom awareness, but habitual awareness.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 Because it seems like that would go back to the point that was highlighted earlier

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 about the difference between the conditioned mind and then that open awareness

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 kind of from the first chapter, it seems.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 So, yeah, I mean, definitely I think what Dropa was talking about was that, you know,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 that conditioned mind, you know, that one monkey mind has the,

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 has all the karma patterns that make it tick and work and go.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 But then that awareness, like, particularly, again,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 to say it's that uncommounted, not influenced by karma,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 and not particularly drawn or grasping.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 I think in Abhidharma, there's, everything's divided in either matter or consciousness.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 So mind is consciousness.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 Like those habit patterns are part of consciousness.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 So it's that, in terms of existence, there's those basic two types.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 So then, what does and what doesn't die?

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 What dies?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 Body dies.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 What doesn't die?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 Come on.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 What kind of mind?

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 Okay, there's a mind.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 Okay.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Do you have something there?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 Just, I mean, I can't just, it's not, just looking at the 12 links again.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 I mean, it's more looking at the chapter.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 And since I was in Abhidharma, she is talking about mind and thoughts

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 and moments of thoughts, and then he takes it to lifetimes

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 and birth and death, as though that's, but then the way it all,

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 and then later in the conversation, how we're going to, like,

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 emptiness realization as things are rising.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 But that whole, I mean, just taking the way every,

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
 this is so beautiful, the way the 12 links can apply to so many levels,

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 just like in the chapter here in the way, of to, like, whole lifetime to lifetime.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.000
 Instantaneous little moments of perception, how it's all, and all of this,

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 that's all the conditionality happening within this.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 But that conditionality is part of that consciousness.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 Dualistic consciousness.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 So they say, in the 12 links, if we have non-grasping wisdom awareness,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 how does that fit in with the 12 links?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 They say that that's when we recognize how our mind is before there's any ignorance.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
 It knows itself.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 And so the first link doesn't start, and none of the rest of them start either.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 So in that moment, we stop right at the root of samsara.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 It doesn't arise at all.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
 But then if we still have karma that's from past,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 then we have to keep recognizing the source of that karma.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
 So that's non-grasping mind is recognized before the first link.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 And then otherwise we have, there's no other way we can go through the samsara.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 It goes back to what Doug was saying.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.760
 I thought, I really liked what you said about how we have that experience of practicing non-grasp

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.000
ing.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 You know, this thought comes up, and we just choose not to grasp it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 And that's really cutting the link right there.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 It becomes experiential at that point.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 Just thinking about it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 And that's the real practice there, is actually not grasping.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 I think a lot of them have that.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
 Can we practice that for 15 seconds?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:52.000
 Is that okay?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:21.000
 Thank you.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 Thank you.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 Thank you.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 Thank you.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 Thank you.
