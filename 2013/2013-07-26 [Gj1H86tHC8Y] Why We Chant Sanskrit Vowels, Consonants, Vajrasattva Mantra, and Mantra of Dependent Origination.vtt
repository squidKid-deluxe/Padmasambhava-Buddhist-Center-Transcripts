00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 Chant those vowels, consonants, and Vajrasattva Mantras, Interdependent Coordination Mantras.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.880
 There is four groups of the mantras.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.970
 First is vowel, second is consonant, and third is Vajrasattva Mantra, and then fourth is Inter

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.320
dependent Coordination Mantras.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.240
 These three, these four mantras are very special and very powerful,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.880
 and generally these four are the vowel and the consonant, and every sound is a system.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.450
 Whether that pronounces some meaning immediately that we can understand, or not, all best on the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.400
 vowel and consonant.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.920
 It doesn't matter whether it is the language of the human beings, language of the non-human beings,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.120
 or the sound of the beings, sound of the non-beings, beings, whatever sound is best on the walls

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 and consonant combination, that's it, it is.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.040
 Therefore, two kind of, because the mantra is best on the voice and sound to make that everything

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.240
 perfect and beautiful.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.560
 If there is some mustang arrows and mistings, anything silver, or any some,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.790
 three kind of make that show perfectly, and then the lineage masters instructed to giant those vow

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.200
els and consonants.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.840
 So we giant vowels and consonants.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 And as I said the other day, vowels are also, specifically we talk that vowels and consonants has

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.240
 two different kind of purpose.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:44.210
 Vowels are represented as skillful means, and consonants are represented as skillful means, and vow

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.920
els represent as the westerns.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440
 That is what is known.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.280
 And M5V, where the consonants came, it really came from the vowels.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.080
 Vowels are the basic foundation of the sound systems, basic foundation of the sound systems.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.270
 So therefore, always in the very end teaching, imagine vowels representing of the great emptiness,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.520
 great worship, great emptiness, great wisdom,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.360
 great mother-pandaparamata, all mother is also there.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 That is what the vowels represent.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.280
 It is in a simple word, it is the wisdom, wise, feminine aspect of the natures.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 That is what the vowels are, vowels.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 And from that display or from that nature, what is arising?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.830
 Then more actively arising, known as consonants, more kind of more precisely, a bird is a consonant

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.160
.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.360
 That is in the teaching of what is said, it is in the very end of teaching, in the secret of anger,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.800
 said it is represented as skillful means.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.240
 Skillful means, from the wall arises all those skillful means things.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.900
 And the combination of skillful and wisdom, then it is pronouncing something magically, coming out

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.040
 of the different words, syllables, or not syllables, different words coming,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.950
 that will explain the meaning, carry it, so that we can understand what talks in the conceptual

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.200
 level, as emanation, combination of that.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.290
 So therefore, vowels and consonants are so speaking, in the secret level, because all the soul

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.360
 systems really pass down this.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.300
 So this is the root of the mantras, not just the root of the anything, it is the root of the mantra

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.360
.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.840
 Every sound is vowel and consonants are, that is why it is so important in the speech.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.880
 And of course, every language has vowel and consonant.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.200
 With all the vowel and consonant, there is no pronunciation welcome.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.840
 But however, this time, using the Sanskrit, as I said the other day, and many times, we all know,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.720
 we heard from many great our masters.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.400
 The Sanskrit language is the language of the devotees, the language of the also enlightened beings.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 In the Buddhist literature, the Mahayana literature, he said, when you read the enlightenment, the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.520
 first time when you give the teachings,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.300
 teaching what language you will speak, and the teaching said, you will speak the language of

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.040
 Sanskrit, you will speak.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:30.560
 So therefore, we just begin that connection right now, that we can only speak beautifully the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.840
 Sanskrit language,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.680
 and turn will of dharma in the Sanskrit language, and we make this beautiful connection.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 And that's what always the teaching says.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 So that is the breathing meaning of the vowel and consonants.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 And then, the next one is the mantra of the Vedic Satras.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.240
 And the Vedic Satras is mantra of the, generally, of course, it is the mantra of the Vedic Satras.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.330
 But often, you see, it is the mantra of all the Buddhas, all the Buddhas, mantra of all the Buddhas

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.480
.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.570
 One hundred peaceful and vital Buddhas mantra is combined in the Vedic Satras mantra, and this has

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.720
 one hundred syllables.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 Or at least a hundred syllables, mantras. It represents a hundred peaceful, vital activities.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.880
 So it is the mantra of all the Buddhas.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.360
 That means, it is one hundred Buddhas, expanding way, it is the mantra of the all, the mandalas of

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.160
 the Buddhas.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.400
 And every summarized one hundred Buddhas, it is summarized into five dhyana Buddhas, five dhyana.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.480
 So therefore, this is the mantra of the five dhyana Buddhas, too, in that way.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.940
 And if we summarize that, then it summarizes the Vedic Satras, so it is the mantra of the Vedic Sat

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.480
ras.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.880
 So it is, therefore, this mantra is so powerful, so special, and it has power to cleanse, purify,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.400
 and all the negative, really, obscurations and the reverse of our Buddhas natures opens it.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.960
 Among all the mantras, the Vedic Satras mantra is the most powerful mantra to cleanse, purify,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.280
 and refining, glorifying our nature, and that's what the teachings always say.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.200
 So therefore, then we practice these mantras.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 And then, next one, is the inter-tryptical ordinary mantra.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.680
 Inter-tryptical ordinary mantra is, that means, actually, everything in these phenomenal systems,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:31.360
 whether it is samsara, whether it is nirvana, it is all connected, all interconnected.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:43.520
 Inter-woven, everything is woven, interwoven, woven, it is interwoven, woven state, everything.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.480
 And everything is dependent to each other.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.440
 There is nothing, one single object produces everything.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.880
 Everything is woven, connected, and through that,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.680
 medically, beautiful things are going up, again, that connected, it is ongoing, woven,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.200
 woven display of the nature, nature.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.200
 Therefore, to walk this beautifully, all our practice meditation is interdependent.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.720
 Our meditation, everything is, again, we are creating that way,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.320
 we are creating a beautiful circumstance, situation,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.720
 situation and condition, the cause, so that will bring beautiful result, result,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.160
 medically beautiful result, that is what we are doing.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.280
 For that reason, then, to highlight that, when that show becomes something,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.400
 everything becomes favorable condition, according our week, according our goal,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.920
 and therefore, we join the mantra of the inter-tryptical ordinary nachin mantras.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.480
 Then, inter-tryptical ordinary nachin mantras is actually in the Buddha teaching, is

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.800
 essence of the Buddha teaching, essence of the Buddha teaching.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.200
 From day one, Buddha gave the teaching,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.800
 until he entered Mahaprabhu in the run, the last day,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.960
 the whole, his teachings are best on the inter-tryptical ordinary nachin teachings.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.160
 There is nothing teaching that out of that systems, teachings.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.320
 And therefore, his teachings are true, his teachings are natural,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.400
 his teachings are the way things are, and only showing that.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.600
 Buddha did not create it, Buddha did not publicize anything.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.680
 Buddha only cured us, where the things are.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.200
 That even these natures have been so close with us,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.400
 due to our naive and our ignorance, we did not show.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.400
 Even it is with us all the time, but Buddha pointed out,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.880
 with things are, as he described, as he realized it,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.200
 through his conviction, through his loving kindness, he showed us that.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.000
 And therefore, these teachings, entirely teachings of inter-tryptical ordinary

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.760
 nachin mantras teachings. And for that reason, then we join these mantras.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.120
 And then more the teaching, also when the teaching said,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.120
 there is a, when we kind of make the, blacken the samayas, or when we kind of,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.400
 when we fall in the ditch, when we fill ourselves with ditch,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 there is ditch that related with the body, that ditch that related with the speech,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.200
 ditch that related with the mind. So we can fall any of those three ditches.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.560
 And therefore, to clear up that ditch of the body in the teaching said,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:45.280
 then we join the consonants. Consonant mantras are repairing ditches.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.760
 Ditches of that will make, hurt our body, and connect the body with the body,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.400
 our body and the body of the Western Dakini Kṛṣṇa, or form of īkṛṣa.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.560
 Kṛṣṇa form is not just only that form, what we visualize.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.880
 It's all what we would ever see them at the very beginning when we meditate, meditate.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.560
 And to feel that the ditches of our, if we fall ditches of that,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.440
 our relative with the speech, and that is then over, over.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.360
 There's something that we did by our mind, and that is where you suffer mantras.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.320
 And to fill up that everyday path with balance, and then we do the interdependent mantras.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.360
 So those are the meaning and purpose of these mantras.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.480
 Brilliant meanings.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.000
 Of course, it can be, has huge meanings.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.880
 Meanings, and that is, again, his own individual which has his own handwriting

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.920
 and translated those, for example, Vajasattva mantras that translated into English.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.720
 You can look at that, but it's big meanings, everything.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.680
 It's big meanings.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.200
 But however, as I said, meaning, the power of the mantra is not just coming by the,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.840
 by the knowing the meaning of the mantras.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.960
 But it's all coming by our concentration, devotion, and joy in that practice.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.320
 That really will come.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.080
 So those are the really about this consonant in the words.
