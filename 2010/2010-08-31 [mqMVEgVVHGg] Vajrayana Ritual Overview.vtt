00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
 "And as well as many others, we are strengthening these practices. And then generally we all know

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 the Buddha gave many different levels and categories of the teachings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 Those teachings are known as sutra teachings and as well as tantra teachings. And sutra teachings

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.000
 and tantra teachings, those are the kind of simple ways to understand or to make divisions.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 And then this time we focus on more tantra teachings or tantra teachings. And tantra teaching has

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.630
 many different, again, categories, according to the readiness of the individuals or many

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.000
 practitioners.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.340
 Those are known as outer tantra, inner tantras, and so forth. And this is, again, generally more

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.000
 focusing on the inner tantras.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.650
 And inner tantra, again, this practice can summarize whole entire practice or the tantra teaching

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.000
 can summarize into two categories.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And those are known as two-stage practices. Two-stage practices or yeah, two-stage practices.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.370
 And those are known as then the visualization of the creation-stage practices as well as then

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.000
 practices of the dissolving and the completion-stage practices.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.320
 Those are the two categories. When you put tantra teaching into practices, and that's what we

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 should really follow that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.730
 And this time we are going to focus more about the creation-stage of the visualization aspect of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.000
 practices.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And this visualization part as well as practices then need many different kind of preparations.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And we like to make more, kind of like more elaborated according to lineage instructions.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.930
 Lineage instruction is very, very important because tantra teaching generally is very vast and deep

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.000
 teachings.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 Deep teachings, in order to really bring forth the essence meaning of the tantra teaching or tantra

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.000
 practices, must be, we must have the lineage teachings.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.980
 And those are known as then, such as sadness. Sadness is so important because otherwise tantra is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 so deep as ocean or as vast as sky.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.480
 Sky, there is so many different meanings. And those I think many of the times we started last few

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.000
 years.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 Years ago there were six limits and four systems. Those are tantra kind of codes. In a way those

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.000
 are signical codes. C-O-D-E-R-V.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The codes. Codes are important to reveal each of those meanings.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 If we don't have the right to code, we must understand the meaning of entire tantra teachings.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 So therefore this sadhana is important. Sadhana is, in a way, released the codes.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Codes released is ready to practice. Ready to apply that. So therefore sadness is important.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 For that reason the great master, Guru Pramma Sambha said in his teachings, one of the teachings

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 said,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.490
 Sadhana tantra is related with sadness. Sadhana is related with ritual, ritual ceremonies or

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.000
 rituals.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.680
 Ritual is related with lineage. And the lineage is related with the pit instructions of the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.000
 teachers.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.350
 That is how all connected. Without using the right instruction and lineage, then it won't bring the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.000
 essence meaning and essence power of the teaching.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.110
 Also is also known as then, we are in a way trespassing. Trespassing is something that is so

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.000
 special, so sacred, so many great practitioners

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 and so many dakas and dakinis and the buddhas and the dharmas. Therefore always in the teaching

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 said we should honor the lineage.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.340
 We should honor the instructions. And then if we honor that, we are in the right line and the

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.000
 lineage blesses.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.110
 Blessings of the wisdom and compassion then entered easily to the mind's strength of the individual

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.000
 and we follow the lineage.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.250
 The meaning of the lineage also means then we have the joy, appreciation, respect. And those are

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.000
 all then combined, known as devotions.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.110
 Devotions and all that is important. Because then really observing that teaching so beautifully and

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.000
 so special.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And without that, then in a way we try to use something that we don't have the right instruction

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and the right knowledge and the right kind of ways to enter.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.320
 And then is also known as kind of like breaking the systems or breaking the Samayas. Samayas and V

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.000
ichis.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Not good. Not good for the practitioner because we like to really practice.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.620
 Practice means we like to revere our goodness of the nature. The purpose of the practice is to reve

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.000
re the goodness.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Goodness of one's own nature of the mind, one's own self and then inspire other with that goodness.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.990
 That is what really the practice means. And the goodness is then known as in the Buddha's teaching

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.000
 as you all know.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.690
 The Buddha nature, Buddha nature that we like to revere. We all know that it is such a wonderful

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.000
 goodness nature.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 But this goodness nature is covered up with many habit patterns, layers of layers.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Those habit patterns we carried in the past times, maybe many lives before.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.070
 And this time also additionally we added so many different habit patterns since we have grown up

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.000
 until now.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.250
 There are so many kinds of dogmas, habit patterns and so many kinds of extra laggages, extra

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.000
 packages that we added up one after another.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 That which is making ourselves heavy and burdened and driving down to that of our goodness nature.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And then almost a kind of disappeared. It must kind of be hidden in the midst of all that.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And for that reason then the practice is we are coming back to our center, our own nature status

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 and bring that goodness and make ourselves happy in joy.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.780
 One of the beautiful beings on this earth and then stay with that beauty and live this world with

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.000
 that beauty.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And that is the meaning of life, I think. That is the simple purpose of this story of life.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.760
 Make happy ourselves, make happy others and stay with happy and live this with happy and live the

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.000
 legacy of the happiness and goodness to the others.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.660
 So they can be inspired, continue that happy as the chain reaction, as the ripples of the goodness

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.000
 continue carried.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.510
 That's what all those great masters did, the Buddha did. And all those six ornaments of the great

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.000
 master of the India did.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And as well as 25 disciples of Guru Purnima Sambha as we did in the odd centuries.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 The odd centuries, still the ripple is continuing those great and people of the goodness.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And such as all those what we call the great masters, great teachers, they practice the goodness.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Goodness of love, joy, peace, happiness, happiness.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.340
 Revert that goodness and share that and continue that life left still is as like radiating as like

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.000
 what we call the northern light.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Continually echoing that. And that is what we should. We should and that is our goal.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.120
 In order to do this, then this ritual ceremony is very important. We are truly entering in the

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.000
 lineage.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.690
 Lineage. Not just theoretically, kind of like watching that we are not watch, watch dogs, but we

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:55.000
 are actually engaging courageously, joyfully and happily we enter in the lineage.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.340
 And that is what is all about the rituals. Ritual ceremony. So therefore this ritual is again

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.000
 important.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And when we are speaking about the ritual now, now that is our kind of the main topic and there is

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 three ways to understand of this ritual.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.340
 And again, ritual is related with the, with the, among the two principles is related with the

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.680
 visualization aspect of the practice, or the creation stage aspect of the practice of the Vedayana

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.000
 with the sadness.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Sadness are the manuals, manual instruction how we should make the practices.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.720
 Again, practice is then more kind of elaborate way to understanding. I think that is what we all

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.000
 know.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:52.480
 That means practice. Practice means we are practicing, bring the full realization of the three Ved

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.000
as.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Three Vedas, Vedara body, Vedara speech and Vedara mind.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.860
 Or sometimes also known as the poor mothers, poor mothers, the entire phenomena existing of all

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.000
 this appearance.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:21.410
 Appearance, the old, the mass, mass, M-A-B-M-A-S-S, mass, mass, all existing mass phenomena

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.000
 appearing is known as the mother of the divine body.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.120
 Is all, everything, not just selected object, but entirely cosmic existing or beyond the cosmic,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.000
 anything is existing.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Mass, those are known as the divine mother of the body of the Buddhas.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.320
 And all the sound systems existing, entirely universe, including our sound systems, is divine, Madh

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.000
ara, Dharma Madhara of the Buddha speech.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So this is the mother of the speech.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And then entirely existing of divine space, so entire space, including our own mind.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Mind is the murderer of the divine mind or the Buddha mind, Samayas.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Samayas, this is three murderers.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.050
 Then the poor murderer is known as entirely everything, looks like they are body, speech, mind,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.000
 looks like separated entities.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.680
 But in the reality level, everything is equal, everything is united, there's nothing is really out

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.000
 of the natures.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Natures, all are within the one single state of the economy, union state of the Madras.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 So it is called union Madras of the great inseparable state.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 This is the poor mother that we are going to explore, explore by the ritual practices.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Ritual practices will help to ignite that call, that realization.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 For that reason, Gurbam Masambhar said, also one of his teachings, he said,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 when you do the ritual ceremony, it brings the splendor of the blessings and the call of the mind.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 It brings splendor, right?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Splendor.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Splendor.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Splendor.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 It brings the glory.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 It brings the glory and the power.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 It shines out.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 It will bring that call.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 So therefore ritual ceremony is very important.
