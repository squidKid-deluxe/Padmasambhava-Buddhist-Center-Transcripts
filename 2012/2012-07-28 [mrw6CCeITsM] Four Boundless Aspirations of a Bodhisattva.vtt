00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 The next step is then in the Mahayana teaching known as practicing on the bodhisattva.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.360
 Bodhichitta is now what we should move forward with.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.450
 We need refuge practices, we need refuge because we need refuge, we need refuge because we need

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.480
 teaching.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:31.760
 We need teaching, we need friends and assistants to move forward and to discover our journey,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.060
 advancing our journey. We need that all. Therefore, we are going to keep that, as I said, in the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.720
 core of our heart.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.360
 Together, now we are going to levitating, igniting our levels.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.680
 Not that now we are going to think all the things. I am objecting refuge, I am going to make this

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.840
 something special and myself.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:04.220
 But what I bought, others, others. Therefore, thinking about others then we don't know and develop

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.520
 the bodhichitta.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.760
 What is bodhichitta and many of you know, again. But I am going to move, kind of like essence.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.100
 Therefore, we can observe that in the heart and we can carry and remind that again to each other,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.840
 whenever you know about each other.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.920
 Bodhichitta is simple, you see, it is love, it is compassion, it is wisdom, all is wisdom and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 combined together.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.080
 And often the great master said, the compassion, focus by compare to all the beings.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.150
 Thinking of the sentence, all living beings, by compassion. And by wisdom, you are thinking of

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.360
 enlightenment.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.520
 So that means, compassion, you look to the sentence beings, by wisdom, you look to discover your

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.360
 nature.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.000
 Even more better, more yourself. Because we like to, that means what? Even more better.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 Because we like to be very efficient compassion activities. Efficient compassion activity must be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.880
 guided by wisdom.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 With all the wisdom, compassion could become kind of emotions and could be blocked.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.800
 Therefore, it is like guided. Compassion is guided by the wisdom. It is a smart compassion.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 Smart compassion, intelligent compassion and practical compassion.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 Therefore, it is guided by wisdom that compassion comes.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.240
 Compassion alone could be, as I said, could be blocked, you could be dug, could be become emotions

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.360
 and handedness.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.280
 And even you start something very special, but then kind of like stopped there.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.320
 That is lack of the wisdom and a lack of how to take care of the compassion.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:15.610
 Compassion is so great, it is so important, so important, so special to bring joy and peace to all

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.960
 the beings.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.560
 But that must be guided by wisdom.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 Wisdom and compassion go by target, not by sight, by sight. Become target. Compassion is wisdom.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.360
 Wisdom is compassion. That is what we need to move forward.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.200
 And therefore, to start with this compassion, and what is the teaching said?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.760
 First is, known as always, poor, boundless. Poor, boundless.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.560
 Poor, boundless, when you speak of that, why is poor, boundless? You heard it many times.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.360
 But poor, boundless, if you go more kind of detail, more pacifically, there are three ways it is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.040
 boundless.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:22.400
 Optic is boundless, subject is boundless, and then the beneficial is boundless.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 All, all the power is boundless. Therefore, it is called three different ways it is boundless.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.360
 Optic is boundless, where this compassion is going to touch.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.800
 The compassion is going to touch to all the beings.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:52.080
 The number of beings cannot be numbered, cannot be put in numbers in zeros.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.560
 It is beyond numbers. Therefore, it is countless.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:12.240
 So these countless beings, now our compassion will be also countless, to touch to all these beings.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:23.680
 So therefore, as object is boundless and countless, our, to match up that, to match up these beings

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.680
,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.840
 our attitude and openness of the heart is boundless and infinite.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.400
 Therefore, it is known as boundless, countless, inmeasurable.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.800
 Those all words are used to me. When you have matched up that qualities,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.720
 the magnitude and the power is gaining to yourself and benefit to the beings is also

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:06.080
 measureless, boundless, and countless. Therefore, it is known as poor boundless.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.000
 This is again so special. This is the heart essence of the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.160
 Often, Kenti Padheeramud said, this is true. This is the poor boundless and bodhic.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:28.720
 The teaching is one of his line's robes, Buddha's line's robes, loudly felt.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.320
 That means this line's robe cannot be overpowered by any other animals.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.960
 Everybody will have to follow that. That is because it is true. It is powerful.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:54.000
 Similarly, this love and compassion, the joy and the equanimity for the bodhic cata is true.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:04.320
 Nobody can again search, refute and treat this statement, treat this meaning.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:14.400
 Nobody, like logically, reasonably, or literally, no kind can refute.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:23.360
 Nobody can say love is bad, love and kind is bad. Nobody can say compassion is bad.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:32.400
 Nobody can say joy is bad. Nobody can say equanimity, the balance is bad.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.040
 Nobody can say it logically. Maybe in the kind of Dronma level,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.520
 can put it, refute that, oh, it's not good, not this and that things.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.080
 But at the reality level, no kind can refute this and defeat that.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.800
 Therefore, it is one of Buddha's line's robes. No great teachers in this universe

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.960
 said it as this immensity, said it as Buddha's. Buddha is one of his extraordinary

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.480
 messages. It's also true. Yes, Buddha said it because we follow. But it's true.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.360
 How important, how special, how wide, how impartial to reach our own sentiment,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.680
 not discriminate that group, this group, that group, this and that thing.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.200
 The comparison is pervasive. Love is pervasive. The joy is pervasive.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.760
 The balance is pervasive. Truly, you read, I read that meaning in the heart.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.960
 Truly, it's very uplifting, opening. It shatters all the ego clings.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.120
 Regimen to consult with the duality, publicate so many borders and left,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.280
 one after another in the different directions.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:55.200
 Kind of we have become that shadow completely. Truly, it's uplifting statement,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.680
 uplifting practices, uplifting great voice.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.720
 This is our luck, our fortunate that we connected to these great teachers.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.800
 How wonderful, how beautiful. And we have this, and we truly have this.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.640
 There's no difficult to bring the peace and happiness in this world.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.040
 And everybody has this peace, peace of what Buddha said.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.800
 Peace of this in their heart, ignited that. The peace,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.000
 the all, this is what they're talking in the world,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.560
 looking forward, it will become almost peaceful case.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:43.360
 Truly, it will. This is what's so important. And now, with this understanding,
