Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 3\nApril 18, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 The systems are straight, clear. We nervous system, our nervous system, our movement within the

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:15.350
 movement of the channel is winded. Wind will be straight. Wind will be straight, that will help to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.000
 calm down our mind.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.710
 So therefore, forced to prepare to keep the normal position of the body as the postures. And then

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.000
 speech is more connected with wind.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.700
 So as in the teaching always said, keep the natural state of the breathing, our air, not just

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.000
 extending or shortening anything. Normal stages live as it is.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 That is the balance of the speech, and the mind balance is not wandering our mind to the past, to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 the future, or to the present. Be in the stillness state of the right now, in the present state.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.580
 That is, is the natural state or the natural positions of the mind. With that positions, and then

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.000
 feel the joy in appreciation and bodhijada thoughts, as we always talk in that bodhijada.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 Really bring more joy and more joy in appreciation and bodhijada. To all living beings, wish good

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 things to every living being.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.650
 My practice, may my practice become also become one of the beneficial, one of the crucial cause and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.000
 the condition to bring the joy and peace, happiness to the world.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.930
 And then finally, everyone is in enlightenment. Wishing those strongly thought. And then in here

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.000
 teaching said, with the strong devotions.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.320
 Come up wearing strong devotions. Feel the presence. Devotion is a combination of joy, and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.000
 confidence, and as well as feeling of the preciousness.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.090
 How precious. Time is precious. Teaching is precious. Our life is precious. I'm going to use this

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.000
 preciousness of this beautiful, made by Buddha and Gaurabhema Samhava.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:28.890
 Bamanamata. Lineage my husband. Help me to fulfill that goal. Really, really. And with all those

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.260
 beautiful, sizzling, those devotions, precious, sizzling devotions without any skeptical hesitation

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.000
 and doubt and all that, really bring up those.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 Those beautiful motivations of that, and release all those emotions and feel the presence of the D

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.000
any, the Guru, in Bodhima, the All-Buddha Dharma Sanghas.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.580
 In this case, Dany, Bhubala Matharas. Bhubala Matharas is not just one single individual, it's a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.000
 Bodhima, the All-Buddhas, Dharma, Sanghas of the past, the person in the future.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.880
 Everyone comes together in one single state. And all your teachers and masters, that you feel

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.350
 connected, everyone comes together in one single state as Gaurabhaman Matharas or Gaurabhema Samh

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.000
ava.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.810
 All the master of the Kama and the Therma Lineages, and all the master of the India and the Estebed

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.000
as, all those great Buddhist masters, any country, anywhere you feel connected, feel that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.700
 And here it's talking, in Bodhima, all the Buddhas, all the Dharmas and Sangha members feel that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.000
 and then do this brave. It's very popular, we went yesterday, that.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And then more specifically one is here, in page two. And that is here, or translated, or in a bit.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.860
 Oh yeah, in translated, precious teachers, essence of all the Buddhas of the 30 times, and please

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.000
 consider me.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.600
 So this, that we will join this prayer, the four line prayers, with confidence, with the yearning,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.000
 with the longing.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.610
 In the teaching he said that we can bring up those, longing and yearning, feel the preciousness,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 and feel happy, and feel lucky, ourselves, lucky, and how fortunate we are.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.250
 Really feel a pillar of those. Then join this prayer. And of course it's translated all. Translated

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.000
 all. And in the Tibet, what is it?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.420
 It means essence of all the Buddhas of three times. Who is that? That's what we visualize in Brah

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.000
man Mater, on Gharapama Sama, right in front of that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.720
 And that is essence of all the Buddhas of the three times. Past Buddhas, such as according to the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.000
 teaching, there are so many past Buddhas.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.900
 All these Buddhas, those are like, among every say, one thousand Buddhas come to this world. Among

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.000
 that, four or three Buddhas, normally called three Buddhas, came before.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.990
 The Buddhas are still considering the Buddhas of now. The Buddhas, those are in the Tibet called

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.000
 the Quran Jai Buddha, Serta Buddha, or Song Buddha.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.350
 Those are three Buddhas who came before. Before there are so many other seven different Buddhas

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.000
 came before the beginning of the one thousand Buddhas.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.100
 There are so many Buddhas. All the Buddhas come, the past Buddhas come, in one single state. And

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.000
 now to the Brahman Mater, what we visualize right in front of us.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.630
 Brahman Mater, as I said, is not just one single person. Embodiment all Buddhas, pasts, and then

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.000
 Embodiment all the dharmas.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.750
 In the teaching said, what in the teaching said there is a famous Tantal known as the hip, no, dem

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.000
cho, jaka, sambra Tantal.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:38.100
 In that Tantal said, Lama is Buddha, Lama is Dharma, Lama is Sangha. Lama is Embodiment all the

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.000
 three duals.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.160
 So Buddha, Lama represented Buddha, Lama represented Dharma, and Lama represented Sangha members,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.000
 Sanghas.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.900
 Buddha is all those past Buddhas that I listed. In the future Buddhas come, there is 93, one

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:10.000
 thousand ninety-three, sorry, nine hundred ninety-three Buddhas to come.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So Embodiment all those Buddhas. The person Buddha is known as the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Then Palazzo Buddhas, person Buddha, East Buddha, Buddha Vedasathos, South Buddha, Buddha Vedas,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Rana Sambharas, and West Buddha, Buddha Amitabhas, and North Buddha, Buddha Amoka Siddhas.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 In the center Buddha, Buddha Amo, Vero khanas, those are known as the Five Diane Buddhas.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Then Palazzo Buddhas, Buddha Amitayas, and Taras, and 21 Taras.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 All the emanation Buddhas of what we are living in in our local Kura, those are bodhisattvas, but

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 also Buddhas, menjiciris.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.280
 Every Buddhas come through it in one single state as the Manmatars. And then Sangha members, Sangha

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.000
 members of all those great Arathas,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Chariputara, Maungarputara, and Anand, Mahakahya Pasi, those are, in a way, present these times,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Sangha members.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.020
 And then Sangha members with all the Indians, those great Masters, Sangha members of the Tibetans,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.000
 those greatest,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.210
 and as well as all the different other Buddhist countries, Sangha members, come through it in one

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.000
 single state as the Manmatars,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 in front of our Manmatars who represent that. So really feel the embodiment of everyone.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 That means what they are not just physically represented, but their compassion, their love, their

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 realization,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.750
 their understanding, their skills, and techniques, and method, every skill they have that import is

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.000
.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.090
 That is what the greatest teacher, the Maungarputara and Maungarputara is, who is right in front of

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.000
 our skies.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 And sitting on the lotus, and lotus disk, lotus, and moon disk, and the ticket seat.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.390
 And looking into the eye of compassion, with the smiling face, radiating, emanating so many

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.000
 blessings of light to us, to all the beings.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 It means feel strong presence, presence of that. And so that is. And then who is next?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.650
 All the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, and that includes Dharma, Sangha, and the

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.000
 police, consider them.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Look to us. Not look to any future or long. Look to me sometimes.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Look to me now. Help me now. Just dispel my ignorance now. Pull me out of the muds of the samsara,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 duality, consumptions.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.910
 Those are many other, those calling lama past. Pull me from the muds and the dualities and the

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.000
 pressure with all the emotions.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.240
 I really every dedicate to me to pressure me that. Pull me out of that. Bring me more courage, more

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.000
 confidence, more joy, more power, more skillfulness.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So I can purify and claim and purify everything.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Make me as a hero or warrior to defeat all these negative emotions, obstacles.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Make me as the hero or the warrior like you.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.250
 Buddha is also known as the one who defeated all the poos, F-O-E, I think that's what I'm talking

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.000
 about.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 What that poo is? Poo is obscurations, obscurations, negative emotions. That's the one in Buddhism.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.080
 So that's the poo. That outside poo is not poo, according. That is really the best through the

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.000
 ignorance.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 They are just also pushed with ignorance. But really poo is obscurations, negativities.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 When you defeated that, that is known as the Quran repeated that all the enemies or that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.700
 Make me that warrior. Help me to become me warrior so I can shine continually my beauty, nature of

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.000
 love and compassion, kindness, and continually open.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.260
 I can move in the space of Dharma, freely and help to all beings and joyfully. Really wish those

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.000
 prayers.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So please help me. Look to me. Open me. And then next one, please bless me.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.750
 My mind will be matured and liberated. So bless me. Pull me, bless. Send me the letter of blessings

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.000
.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:08.080
 Blessings are coming as a poem of light. Light, white light, red light, blue light, green light,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.000
 and multiple light.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And white light. I think white light, yellow light, green, red light, blue light, multiple light.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.690
 And then also the Quran chakra emanating white light with the syllable alms. And then the speech ch

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.000
akra emanating red light with the syllable alms.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.070
 And from the heart center emanating blue light with the syllable alms. And bless all the blessings

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.000
 and all the teachings.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.990
 Everything really coming to us completely instantly clarified all the obscurations and the negat

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.000
ivities.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And then he said, liberate, mature my mind. Mature mind, my mind, and liberated my mind.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:08.070
 What means matures? But at the same time, our mind is not mature. Why is the heart hit of all the

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.000
 duality conceptions, negative emotions, so strong, so strong, so kind of hard.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Even there is something wondrous, beautiful that is going on, we don't feel anything.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.930
 And the teaching offering said that even the Buddha is performing all the beautiful display of the

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.000
 magical or the enlightened activities, we don't feel anything.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.810
 Even someone is so pathetic, and so needed, we don't feel any somebodies or anything. So hard-

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:44.000
headed, this ego cling completely blocked our qualities, natures.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And that is called the hard heat, like ice.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.700
 Ice as a solid rock, kind of iron balls, our is nothing there. So that is, when is that is called

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.000
 not matured.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.650
 But when our heart is become more tender, more calm, more peaceful, more love, more compassion,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:13.620
 more joy, more appreciation, more considerations, more kind of respect and appreciation, more kind

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.000
 of like thought of the porginess and the excuses.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.620
 And the open mind, open heart, that is beginning of the mature in the mind. When that happened,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.000
 what we can do, we can liberate it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.850
 What we can liberate it, we can liberate it all the obscurations, negativities, emotions, we can

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.000
 liberate it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.700
 So mature the mind, bring our maturity state with all our beauty qualities, hidden qualities with

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:50.000
 nature of the mind, and liberate all the obscurations, negative emotions.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.190
 Obscurations, those are the kind of larger ways, emotion obscurations, knowledge obscurations, or

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:03.000
 grasping, clinging, negative emotions. Clear way that.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 So then, what would that will happen? Then it will shine the beauty of our own nature, my natures.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 So please bless me that, that status. When that that happened, then what will come, the next one,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 please bless me so that extra oriented realization of the profound part will arise in my beings.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.090
 When that we start to kind of bring our mind is more love and more kindness, more compassion, more

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.000
 devotion, more joy, more appreciation.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And then same time, same time, we kind of liberated all the negative emotions as it arises.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.400
 Then the part of the, then really part of realization is coming, booming, is coming, and here say

00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:00.000
 the profound part of the, profound part of the, profound part is arising.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.480
 What are those parts in the general Buddha teaching? Those are five parts, accumulation part

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:16.000
 arising, application part is arising, seeing part is arising, and meditation part is arising.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:25.700
 And then no more starting part. Part is arising. All 10 boomies, those are gradually coming,

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.000
 arising, from within our heart and mind.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.540
 According to Doki level, those are the four visions. Those are not, what's called, visions of the

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.000
 seeing the true nature, exactly as it is.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.830
 And the seeing and then expanding or increasing the visions and the realizations, second vision,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.000
 second part of the Doki.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Third one, reaching to the peak of the awareness.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.240
 Fourth one is known as then exhausting all the phenomena, duality phenomena, exerting completely,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:15.390
 reaching that order to come that how we have to mature our mind, we have to liberated our negative

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:20.000
 emotions as it arises, liberated.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.940
 When the realization is booming, and we continue to keep that maturity status, then truly, then we

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.000
'll boom.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.210
 The realization of the Doki, even it is so fast, so powerful, so skilled, we need prepared up that.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:47.000
 We have to prepare our self, devotion, joy, both each other, really bring up that.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.770
 And when we have to do devotion, that means our skeptical thoughts are gone or demolishing,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:18:06.000
 decreasing. Our hesitation is decreasing, and our doubt is going to demolish or decreasing.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.300
 And then confidence, joy is arising, and feeling on the brightness is arising, happiness, joy,

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:26.000
 brightness. Then you also will become courage and commitment to you, these beautiful opportunities.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.300
 This is what then the realization comes. When that is happening, and then what in this fourth one

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:42.420
 said, please, please bless me so that may I actually this life, spring part of a clear light, great

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.000
 perfectionist.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.480
 So, so we know of all that happened, all that happened, those are coming one after another. And the

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:58.290
 first is that precious teacher, you're connected to yourself, first line explaining, connect to

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:03.000
 yourself to the lineage with the devotion, a strong confidence.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.610
 Then you also pray to mature my mind and liberate, I can ever liberated all the consumption of dual

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:18.120
ity and negative emotion. So bless me that. And then that when that happened, and then perform the

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.000
 path of realization is growing, shining, developing.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.930
 So bless me that. When that happened, then we can actually the realization of the profound path of

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:36.000

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.040
 Also all those great masters, we can they within this lifetimes. So please bless me so that may I

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:49.000
 can actually in this life, supreme part of a clear light, great perfectionists.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.700
 So, those are said here, so that is the upper supplicating him or the supplicating llama with those

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:06.300
 prayers, and then dissolve the llama into yourself, then rest in the mind in the equanimities, or
