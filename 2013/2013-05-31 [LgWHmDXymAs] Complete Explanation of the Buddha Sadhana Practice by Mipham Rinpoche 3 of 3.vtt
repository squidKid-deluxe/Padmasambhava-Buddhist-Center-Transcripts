00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 "It removes all the negativities, obscurations, obstacles, diseases, sicknesses, and then negative

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.380
 emotions and re-revealing them. That continues what we started. Become that. And that is what it is

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.320
 called. When you become true, that is known as enlightenment. That is enlightenment. There is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.890
 nothing else in enlightenment. Enlightenment starts right now. It is not a wedding game for the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.600
 next centuries or that is malignance or the good times.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.160
 It starts, enlightenment starts right now. It is enlightenment. It is true love, true compassion,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.690
 true wisdom. Whenever we start, we begin the journey of enlightenment. It is true. That is what the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.740
 Buddha said. That is what the great master, Kinti Padhe, you know, and his home is with you. Sit

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.600
 there. Again, I will do it. And that's it.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.590
 And then in the teaching, sit up there. And then if you meditate like this, and resume like that,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.600
 and then after that, do meditate like this.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 A virtue of the twatruti, matryana, are friendly, astralic, and the state of Kṛṣṇa return its

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 attention. With that, pray and meditate as long as you time. This time, I call silence meditate.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.690
 Relax comes in peaceful. Whether you are doing samadam meditate, whether you are doing vivācana

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.300
 meditate, it is like zoka or the mahamadam, relax. Not just that, disturb your corpse by

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.600
 distractions. Relax in that person's state.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.900
 The moment you see that those thoughts are wandering from your dead state, bring back to that state

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.600
 and then relax as long as you have time. That is known as silence meditation or vipaśa or zoka.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.360
 So that is the principle part of meditation. In practice, kunkalini part of this practice is ded

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.600
icating practice. So dedicate the meditation as we do.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.990
 Once again, bring back your love and compassion and body to the core. Think of all the sentient

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.600
 beings.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.590
 That's it. Now I remember what I said before. Think globally, act locally. That's it. That's an

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.600
 irony.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.450
 So think globally. All the sentient beings, sentient beings over six realms, think that, act

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.600
 locally from our heart.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 That's it. All right, all right. That is known as dedicating meditation.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.380
 We think everyone good and happy, healthy, removes suffering and difficulties, and then revert

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.600
 their Buddha nature.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.720
 Truly that is the practice. It's really, whether we have the big names, whether we have the don't

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 big names, truly we are touching the center core of the spiritual, the Buddha's teachings.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.980
 And that is my brief teaching on these, of course. You all know basically, but I'm reminding, as I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.600
've already said, we are Sangha members.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.190
 Sangha members, the teachings, they're supportive to each other, happy to each other, so that way I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.600
'm reminded to you, I'm reminded to myself.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.020
 So through that we can make our journey together to the enlightenment in Buddhahood and follow the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.600
 footsteps of our great teachers, all masters, lineage.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 So that is my brief talk. Thank you, everyone.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.100
 Okay, now we do these short practice.
