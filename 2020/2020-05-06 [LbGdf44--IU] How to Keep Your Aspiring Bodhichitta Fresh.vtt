00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
 Thank you very much, everyone. Good afternoon. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for coming and, again,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.800
 participating.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.580
 Again, we are continuing our healing retreat. It's been a little while, and we've been practicing.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.650
 Together, it's been wonderful. Again, as we said yesterday, one again, beautiful time that we are

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.280
 spending.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:36.820
 In a way, together, together, inspiring each other, and also, somebody undermining each other's

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.960
 practices,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 but we follow our heart, which is really wonderful. And so, I thank all of you for your

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.080
 participation

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.880
 and your enthusiasm and joy of the practicing. Thank you.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.870
 And now, with this, again, we're going to follow the teaching, and then, particularly this teaching

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880
,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.070
 we're following the highlight by the Khejpavi of the New Rumuji. So, again, with all the different

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.480
 genres,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.280
 not just only this time, as you all know, we should activate our beautiful motivation,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 and with the motivation of the joy and appreciation, and as well as vastness,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.050
 motivation of the bodhicata, and the purity, understanding, or the realization of the entire this

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.520
 phenomena existing.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 Those are all so important. In particular, also, we've been talking about the joy and appreciation,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.880
 which are also more grateful, graceful, gratitude. This is really so important, so good.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.070
 In life, we have so many beautiful situations and circumstances and opportunities. We're surrounded

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.360
 by this.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.480
 But regularly, all of us who are maybe in this retreat, really, to compare with many, many in the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.960
 world,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.840
 what they're going through, challenging and difficult troubles, and to compare with them and look

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.480
 to us

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.080
 and read our situation, read their situation, we have so many ways to thankful, to grateful.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 When we're thankful, grateful, that is dharma, called Buddhism, for that teaching. That is dharma.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.120
 It's not whether we're going on the sidetrack of the dharma. We're in the stream of dharma.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.960
 When practicing with joy and appreciation, being grateful, grateful, where we practice,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.280
 that's the way we need to move forward. That's the way to advance in the teaching and developing

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.200
 our realization with joy.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 And with graceful, thankful, gratitude, we combine both together.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.760
 We already understand the very inner teaching. Truly, it is absolutely beautiful, so beautiful.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.520
 It's so beautiful. It's healing to ourselves and healing to others. At the same time, it's the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.440
 great qualifications,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.640
 the qualifications, obstacles. So I'm really happy to the others too.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.180
 But therefore, this motivation, this intention to activate that, that means we're touching to our

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.360
 goal of true nature,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.690
 true nature of mind. No one we can't ignore or we miss out on that, because we're looking somewhere

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.320
 else,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.360
 and not looking to the way it is really coming, what we need. We're completely distracted.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.560
 That is the duality. That is the handedness. That is the way going to samsara, continually.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.360
 When we should look at our own situations, circumstances, and bring with you in the applications.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.910
 And in all ancient great masters, for example, the body, those who practice in bodhisattvas or bod

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.280
hisattvas,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 every situation they feel grateful. Not just having a good time or good situation, every situation.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.520
 When they have troubles, they are grateful. When they have a good time, they are grateful.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.280
 How that's said? I mean, you all know that. You heard those things. We all know that.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:37.440
 You heard what the teacher said. I'm happy if I'm sick. I'm happy if I am sick, because I am

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.280
 cleansing bad garments.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 I'm happy if I'm not sick. I can increase my gratitude and good deeds to all the beings.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:01.280
 Whatever is good, I'm going to use that form to increase, develop my realization, strength, courage

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.280
, and commitment of the body together.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.380
 That's what we're listening to many times. When we are suffering in sadness, we're cleansing, pur

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.280
ifying.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 We're learning. When we get sad in the suffering, take that as grateful.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280
 According to Bodhisattva yesterday, we're talking about only practice.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.280
 We're taking that suffering. Feel that you're taking suffering, the difficult of other beings.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.280
 So, the other beings are not going to get sick in the troubles. Really, only practices.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:48.280
 So, every situation, circumstances transform into a path in the development of our realization.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:56.280
 Therefore, the courageous ones of the Bodhisattvas never defeated by any situation circumstances.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.570
 They're moving forward. They're moving deeply into their practices. They're going to increase their

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.280
 realization.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.280
 That's what religion teaching says. And that's what all these great practitioners or those masters

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280
 will read,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.280
 read the life story of these great teachers, masters, how they did.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:28.280
 So, therefore, bring up those joys and applications. Being grateful is so important, so special.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.280
 Many times, we're bored. We're bored of being grateful.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:48.280
 We're bored of our life of gratitude because our ego thinking is so powerful, so miserable.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:58.280
 No matter whatever we do for the ego, it's never satisfied. Never satisfied.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:08.280
 Even the whole world is your own. Still, I'm sure the ego will not be happy, not be satisfied.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 Still, something needs more. Something needs more.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.280
 For so many people, when they come completely obsessed with this ego clinging and greedy,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.280
 and we see it, it ended up the troubles.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.280
 Even in this lifetime, so many, those powerful beings, powerful men, powerful people,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.280
 the way high positions, they're obsessed, they're grasping and doing all things,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.280
 and never enough, never ending, ended up, they are completely disastrous leaders.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 Why? Because greedy. Greedy and so ungrateful. Ungrateful.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 Those are the teachings, example tools.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.280
 For those reasons, being grateful is so, so important.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.280
 And all with bodhicitta, it's all arising and generating with bodhicitta.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.280
 When we have a good heart with bodhicitta, that all comes.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.280
 When we have good joy and appreciation, we're exploring our good nature, as I said,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.280
 the nature of the mind. So therefore, we should not miss the opportunity.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.280
 We should not miss the whole point.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.280
 Point our best and home sweet homes. Those are our home sweet homes.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.280
 Homes, we should really activate those with that richness, richness heart,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.280
 richness heart of the grateful, joy, bodhicitta, and then practice.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:51.280
 Then, it's so wonderful, it's so strong, beautiful, humble, simple, smooth,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:58.280
 and deeper than advancing, advancing on the Burmese and Pathist.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.280
 So therefore, those are really important again for all of us,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.280
 and we should always remind each other, ask that,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.280
 and we should remind every day to ask.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.280
 Because in the morning, we will make up, should have what I'm talking,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.280
 these good motivations, joy and appreciation, being grateful for bodhicitta.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.280
 Start day with that, it's so wonderful, it's healing.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.280
 And also, when we go to bed, sleeping, and we can remember that.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:36.280
 Again, we activate those joy and appreciation, appreciation in both each other.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.280
 And during the daytime, have those for two, as many as you can.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.280
 Those are the hard essence of the practice of Buddha Dharma,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.280
 teaching, of the greatest teacher of the Buddha Chapter Moon.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.280
 So those are, again, with those understanding,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.280
 and then we again follow with these teachings what we're doing.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.280
 Again, of course, we follow the instructions of the great Master Munki Bhai,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.280
 the other great Masters.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.280
 I started talking about the first novel, second novel, and third novel,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.280
 and now we are going to talk a little bit about the first novel.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.280
 The first novel is the intentions.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 And the intentions are the same thing, I just said that.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.280
 You're in appreciation, and the bodhicittas, and those are in devotion

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.280
 with the poor renouncing your thoughts.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.280
 Those are said. Not just only in the beginning of time,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.280
 but here, for example, he's known as Dunyurinhui.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.280
 Tiafke Dunyurinhui listed it.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.280
 Those are the trade or the wealth of the practitioners,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.280
 the permanent wealth of practitioners.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.280
 Wealth, that means that if we have this, those with intelligent thought,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.280
 quality in our heart and mind, we are very wealthy practitioners,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.280
 spiritually we are really wealthy practitioners.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.280
 When you're spiritually we know a wealthy practitioner,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280
 that individual is very rich.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.280
 That individual is really rich.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.280
 Material wealth can be very rich, but still mentally unborn,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
 mentally really poor, and very miserous and strange.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 But spiritually wealth, that is the richest person.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.280
 And that is the story often in the Kinti particularly when you say it,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.280
 many times, to all of us, many times.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.280
 We're in the 11th century, the great master,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.280
 but Satya Pendeta was a great master of Tibet,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.280
 of the Satya schools of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:56.280
 and Satya Pendeta was the one of the most famous masters,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 scholars in the Tibetan Buddhism, and I think all in the world.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.280
 Definitely he's very tall and scholarly.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.280
 And he's tall, and they realize at your level,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280
 he is the emanation of the magicians.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.280
 But, so, when Jangis Khan began to explore interest on the spiritual,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.280
 he heard the reputation of the Tibetan Buddhism

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 and the particular reputation of the great Satya Pendeta.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.280
 He invited, invited to it.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 There is long stories, of course.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 Historians, but finally, when Satya Pendeta went to Jangis Khan's court,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 or the palace, in his palace,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.280
 and even though Satya Pendeta is quite old, already the old age,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.280
 but because of his concerning thinking of all the other subjects and other beings,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.280
 if Satya Pendeta thought, if I go to see the Kublakan for this week,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.280
 that will bring more benefit into the subject and all the beings, then,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.280
 so therefore, with this intention, he went to the Kublakan's court,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.280
 and instead, so Kublakan and, sorry, not Kublakan, Jangis Khan,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.280
 and according to that what I heard.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.280
 And then we decided, when they had discussions,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.280
 all that, in the Tibetan, one who is a great master, who is a great scholar,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.280
 who is a great, who is the richest man,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.280
 and who is the most efficient man in the Tibetan,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.280
 all those kinds of, this great Khan asking to Satya Pendeta.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.280
 So Satya Pendeta answered one after another.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 So, personally said, Jangis Khan asked,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 who is the richest man in Tibet?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.280
 He said, Karag Bongchon.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.280
 Karag Bongchon is the richest man in Tibet,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.280
 who is the most efficient man in Tibet.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.280
 Malareva is the most efficient man in Tibet.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.280
 And who is the most, kind of like, educated man in Tibet?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280
 And he said, that consider me.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.280
 He said, kind of referring to himself that.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.280
 And so he asked a minute from those questions.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.280
 So then this great Khan, according to the historical what I heard,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.280
 or that, that he sent messages to check out those things.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.280
 So, reality and when he came to check out those things,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.280
 a message went into Tibet and he checked those

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.280
 and went back to Satya, to King's Court, and then he reported that.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.280
 So, he went to Karag Bongchon, the richest man of Tibet.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.280
 He went to see the Karag Bongchon, the great master.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.280
 So, when he met this richest man, the most richest man of Tibet,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:56.280
 when he went to see him, said, Karag Bongchon is sitting in a cave.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:04.280
 Cave, one mattress that used to be his cushion, this is his blanket.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.280
 One mattress, that is.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.280
 And one is a cub, one kind of cub.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:22.280
 He has yag hu, hu, I think, h-o-o-f, hu, hu, yag hu.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 The yag hu, that is his cub, his bones, bones.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:38.280
 So, this is the richest man, what the great master, Satya Pirda, referred, richest man of Tibet.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.280
 So, it's completely kind of where what we think is quite a difference.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.280
 The most efficient man, that means he was most successful,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.280
 very successful man in the world, in Tibet.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.280
 He saw the Malarepa, the man who said, Malarepa.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:02.280
 Malarepa, who was? He used to call, in his songs, many castles.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.280
 And those are the caves. There's no really castles.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.280
 Those are Malarepa named different castles.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.280
 And so, he was really, I think, again, in an old level, he's an old man.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:23.280
 And with that, I mean, nothing really, kind of very thin cloth.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.280
 Public cloth is very, very thin.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.280
 So, this is what, in the state, the cave, in the mountains.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.280
 And this is the most efficient man in Tibet.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:43.280
 Then, the greatest scholar, that is confirmed as Satya Pirda, is the renowned one, so that's true.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:49.280
 So, we went back and reported that, and then, again, in their discussions.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:58.280
 So, why you said the richest man in Tibet, that Kharagong is maybe one of the poorest men in Tibet.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280
 Why you said that?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.280
 Satya Pirda is not measured by the wealth of material wealth, but outside.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.280
 But it's measured with heart, with contentment.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.280
 How much contentment?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.280
 Kharagong is perfectly fine with all those, that what he has.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.280
 He's so happy, so happy and so rich, he got everything what he needed.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.280
 For today, to reach enlightenment, to benefit for all the beings, his two practices.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.280
 So, therefore, he is the most richest man in Tibet.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 Therefore, the contentment is really known as the richest.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.280
 And that's why, great master Nagarjuna said, on his teachings, let his friend sit.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.280
 Among all the wealth, the contentment is the most richest ones.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:02.280
 For that reason, all great king of my friend increased the contentment, increased the contentment.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:11.290
 That's what really the great Nagarjuna, the master Nagarjuna said to his friend, the two samples,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.280
 that he said.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.280
 So, this is really true.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 The great form is so important, so rich, and it's just a nice, so rich.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.280
 Even you don't have enough things, but that enough, what you have enough,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.280
 it becomes the equivalent of the telenons or billionaires, truly billionaires.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.280
 That's it.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.280
 When you don't have the contentment, even you have the telenons or the billion dollars,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:48.840
 billionaires, still you're born, still trying to grow up, hungry, thirsty, trying to get, trying to

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.280
 grow up.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.280
 Day and night, and then day with death, die with that mental attitude, the power of status.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.280
 So, die with the poor, stay whole life with the poor, with the billionaires.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.280
 Can you believe that? How that happened? Can it truly happen?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.280
 And so therefore, this joy and appreciation is so important.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.280
 We do this forward, and then we're talking about the body catheters.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.280
 Body together is essential to rich enlightenment, as we've been discussing,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.280
 or to benefit from all living beings, and to also make friends to all the beings.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.280
 And we would like to have more friends, friends, increasing body together.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.280
 And we'd like to remove the suffering difficult, increasing body together.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.280
 Body together is everything.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.280
 Therefore, body together is rich, fulfilling jewels.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.280
 It's fulfilling all the riches, all the riches, good things we will fulfill in the samsara,

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.280
 good things we will fulfill in the nirvana.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:05.280
 And therefore, body together is rich, fulfilling jewel of samsara and nirvana.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.280
 It's so special, beautiful.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.280
 And that's what I really in the teaching said.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.280
 And also, all the great practices, master's practices.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.280
 So this body together is divided according to the teaching, to body together.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.280
 First is wishing body together, and second is actualizing body together,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280
 and wishing body together.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 But when we have wishing body together, how we develop?

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.280
 And with this best premise is compassion.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 Compassion with this combined together and taking up all living beings,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.280
 we raise up the body with that thought of body together.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.280
 And then body together is activated and practiced by the full boundless.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.280
 When full boundless are well, kind of quite good and stable,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.280
 and then do the tungmi practices.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.280
 Tungmi practices is one word or one kind of one of the practices among those three.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.280
 As I said, tungmi, yesterday, as I said, or the other day,

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.280
 first is equalizing, dagingyama practices.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.280
 Second is tungmi practices.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.280
 Third is dawijinji.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.280
 Others are more important than myself.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:28.280
 Those three are the exercising of the full boundless practices,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.280
 or wishing body together mentally.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.280
 Full boundless practices, also mentally practices.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.280
 But that also dawijinji you cannot do physically.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.280
 You do as much as you can do according with the capabilities.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:50.280
 But many is a practice of the mind, mentally, expanding.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 That means most of the time in samsara, our mind is very limited,

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:02.280
 it closes many boundaries, but this time we break the boundaries

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:09.280
 and spreading the loving kindness beyond the borders

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.280
 and separating the compassion beyond the borders

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.280
 and spreading the joy and the rejoice

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.280
 without borders and equanimity, without borders.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.280
 That is known as whole boundless.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.280
 That is actually in the teaching, that is nature of the mind.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.280
 Nature of the mind has no border.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.280
 We met border.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.280
 That means dualistic, duality mind met border.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.280
 It is to connect with ego clinging or grasping and clinging.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.280
 Ego clinging and grasping are obscurations.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.280
 They are the handedness, bringing peace and happiness,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.280
 or ultimate peace and happiness.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.280
 Therefore, break the borders is important.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.280
 So now, those are what we've been discussing.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.280
 We have been discussing this whole boundless of the wishing body jetties.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.280
 Now, I'm going to summarize that wishing body jetties.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.280
 Now, wishing body jetta we should always preserve.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.280
 We have to keep this foundation of the actualizing body jetta.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.280
 Wishing body jetta is a foundation.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.280
 As foundation, in the center column, we're going to maintain that.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.280
 And to maintain that, what great master, Lung Kimba said,

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.280
 in the teaching, not just only Lung Kimba,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.280
 great master Nagarjuna, Master Vaidu, or the Buddha Shatamani said,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 these four positive things should always kill

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:09.280
 and four negatives are avoided to maintain, keep up the body jetties.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:26.280
 And first is honoring to the noble ones.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.280
 First is honoring the noble ones.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.280
 Then I'll go into the details, each of those parts.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.280
 First, I'll list it and then we'll go over that.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.280
 The fourth is honoring the noble ones,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:50.280
 or honoring the two winner rebels, honoring to the winner rebels.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:57.280
 And the second is, is entrusting of the good things

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:05.280
 and reducing acknowledging of the good activities.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:17.280
 And third is praising the noble deeds.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.280
 And honesty to all the beings.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:30.280
 Those are known as four positives.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:44.280
 Fourth is honoring to all the winner rebels.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.280
 That means to honor to the elders, your elders,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.280
 not only the elders, all the spiritually elders,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.280
 we should honor them, particularly Bodhisattvas,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.280
 one who is learning the Bodhisattva.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.280
 We are learning the Mahayana teachings.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:12.280
 So, ever who is older, we should always honor them

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.280
 and always respect them.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.280
 When we do that, whatever it does, it will maintain our Bodhisattva.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.280
 It will help us maintain our principle of Bodhisattva.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.280
 Should honor winner rebels, winner rebels.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.280
 And that also includes the elders persons,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.280
 those elders persons, such as our parents,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.280
 our teachers, our spiritual teachers,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.280
 our regular teachers.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.280
 Teachers who are, who showed us, whatever it is,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.280
 he showed us knowledge and skills, matters,

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.280
 respect and particularly, of course, Bodhisattvas

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.280
 who showed us teaching clearly.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.280
 So respect and honor.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.280
 These were externally your honoring those.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.280
 When we understand our Bodhisattva, our body.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:23.280
 Then the next one is acknowledging of the good deeds of others.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.280
 I think that's maybe translated, acknowledge.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.280
 That means anyone who is doing good things,

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.280
 good deed, particular deed of the beneficial thought

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.280
 or good heart, loving kindness, compassion or good heart,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.280
 community level, public level and larger level,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.280
 or even a small level, if we're doing something good,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.280
 we should acknowledge.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.280
 Very good, appreciate.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.280
 That means rejoice, joy and appreciation.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.280
 Your kind of honoring, acknowledging, remembering of the good deeds of others,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.280
 what it does, it will help us to maintain our principles.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.280
 So we know which is good, which is bad.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.280
 We at least acknowledge.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:22.280
 It's so important to sustain, to maintain our wishing Bodhisattvas

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:28.280
 or Bodhisattva, assemble to the Bodhisattva to maintain.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.280
 And then, present to the noble ones.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.280
 Present with the noble ones.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.280
 That means particularly Bodhisattvas.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.280
 Any Bodhisattva who is doing work and helping,

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.280
 supporting, benefiting to the other beings,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.280
 whatever deed is leveled from the really good heart that we see,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.280
 we should always praise them.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.280
 Wonderful, beautiful.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.280
 And same thing, may I happen to do the same thing,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.280
 what they do me.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.280
 May I can follow to help, benefit of others,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.280
 as this individually novels the joy.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.280
 Now what do I do? Acknowledging, sentient, praising.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.280
 Mentally praising, verbally praising,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.280
 physically praising such as pointed hand in Buddhism.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.280
 Pointed hand is honoring, honoring and praising or greeting.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.280
 Greeting.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.280
 Or whatever the tradition is, sporty languages.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.280
 To that honor, that is known as praising.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.280
 So externally you are praising that,

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.280
 but inwardly we strengthen the principle,

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.280
 value of the Bodhisattva.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.280
 It's going to help.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.280
 And then, fourth one,

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.280
 is to be honest to all the beings.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.280
 Honest.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.280
 Simple, honest.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.280
 It's truthful.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.280
 Nice and kind.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.280
 So that means, what we do,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.280
 that met with heart.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.280
 From the heart, it's coming.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.280
 Not pertaining, not counter-relating,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.280
 counter-covering of that.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.280
 But to honest.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.280
 Physically honest, verbally honest, mentally honest.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.280
 With love, with compassion, with wisdom.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.280
 We do that, but in the teachings,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.280
 it will help to maintain the Bodhisattvas.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.280
 Those are known as poor positives.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.280
 And poor negatives are exactly opposite of that.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.280
 So if we do poor negatives, opposite of that,

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.280
 that will hurt, damage our Bodhisattvas.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:56.280
 First is, instead of acknowledging,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:09.280
 honoring that,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:17.280
 and is receiving the Bodhisattvas, receiving.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.280
 So, deceiving only rebels.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.280
 That means, you are doing something,

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.280
 can't be like saying,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.280
 but trained as truth, but reality is pretending.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.280
 So deceiving.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.280
 That will damage the Bodhisattva.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.280
 And therefore, your heart should be there.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.280
 So honor, honor.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.280
 Centennial or carnival deceiving is cunning.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 It is negativities.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.280
 For that reason, it will damage both each other.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 Then it will damage the Bodhisattva.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.280
 It will file up the obscurations, negativities.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.280
 So therefore, carnival like honor.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.280
 And the second one is, second negative is,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.280
 then not acknowledging, but instead,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.280
 you're kind of almost trying to make guilty of the others,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.280
 good performance, good deeds.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.280
 Even there's no reason.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.280
 But also due to that, again, some emotion,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.280
 even if they're doing good,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280
 and the activity is so beautiful, special,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.280
 but kind of trying to make every way,

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.280
 like guilty of the individual one who did good things.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.280
 That is, again, negativities.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.280
 What it does, it will damage our both each other.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.280
 It will create the obscurations.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.280
 And then also, of course,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.280
 we're not instead inspiring and helping the others,

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.280
 then we're also kind of completely there.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.280
 They're interested, enthusiasm, damaging the others.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.280
 So that is second negativity, that damage,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.280
 undermine the both each others.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.280
 And then, next one is,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:23.280
 next one is instead honoring those Bodhisattvas deeds,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280
 and we are criticizing,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.280
 criticizing the Bodhisattva activity of the generosity,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.280
 criticizing the Bodhisattva activities of the moralities,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.280
 or patience, or whatever way,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.280
 trying to kind of criticize the making common,

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.280
 and all that thing.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.280
 That is negativities.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 It is, of course, well-damaged benefit of activities,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.280
 but deep down it is,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.280
 undermining, uprooting our both each other.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280
 Our both each other.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 The precious jewel of the both each other is scarred.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:07.280
 Scarred, scarred, scarred, or it is stained.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.280
 Stained, restraining them.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.280
 Then, fourth negativity is always,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.280
 always growing or using the last word,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.280
 the cunning and hypocrisis,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.280
 hypocrites activities to the other leaders.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.280
 Hypocrisis or cunningness.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.280
 Or I think also there is a word called swirling.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.280
 Swirling, swindle.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.280
 Swindling.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.280
 Swindling.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.280
 Swindling.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.280
 Swindling or cunning, or deceitful.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.280
 Deceiving.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.280
 So that means pretending nice, beautiful,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.280
 cover-up. Reality is bullshit.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.280
 Oh, I'm not going to say other words.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.280
 It's not good.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.280
 It's bullshit.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.280
 It's the cover-up.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.280
 So the cover-up, the bullshit,

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.280
 is sonalete is not going to feel good.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.280
 So this is the...

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 Even though it's a short time, folks,

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.280
 but then it's not that time we propose.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.280
 It is undermining, damaging our body together.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.280
 Body together.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.280
 We prefer a jewel of the body together.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.280
 The precious jewel that we are holding is really damaging.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.280
 That means we are receiving all the beings

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.280
 and all the enlightened beings.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.280
 When we took a rough body together of ours,

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.280
 we invited all the beings for six rounds.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.280
 We invited all the gods.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.280
 We invited all the invisible beings.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.280
 We invited all the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Bodhisattva.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.280
 In front of that, we declared that today

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.280
 I'm going to check the Bodhisattva

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.280
 to benefit all living beings.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.280
 I'm going to follow with all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.280
 Exactly what you did.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.280
 I'm going to follow with that same way.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.280
 We declared that, not loudly.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.280
 Then also in teaching,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.280
 it said when we checked the Bodhisattvas

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.280
 and all the gods and Buddhas enlightened,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.280
 everybody rejoiced.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.280
 They rejoiced.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.280
 We declared that we told all the beings,

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:39.280
 "Today I invite you to be my best friend."

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.280
 From now on, I'm not your enemy.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.280
 I'm not your opponent,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.280
 but I am nothing but your services.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.280
 That we declared.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.280
 And now we're doing this cutting in the seed force.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.280
 So we are deceiving,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.280
 not just one single part, two single beings,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.280
 but all the beings.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.280
 They call the teaching.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.280
 And not just one Buddha, two Buddhas,

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.280
 or one Bodhisattva, two Bodhisattvas.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.280
 We're deceiving all the trying to deceive,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.280
 even though we cannot deceive the Buddha, the Bodhisattva.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.280
 But we're just trying to deceive.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:22.280
 Cover up our eye and perform some blindfold activities.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 Then what it does?

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.280
 It damages our body together.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.280
 So therefore, it is so important,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.280
 so precious to preserve this jewel.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280
 Jewel.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.280
 This jewel is not just a jewel, as I said,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280
 short-term period.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.280
 This jewel of the body together,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.280
 love, kindness, compassion.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.280
 It's jewel of all the time.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.280
 And all the beings,

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.280
 all the beings, every living beings,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.280
 this is so special, so beautiful, so powerful.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.280
 Therefore, in what the teaching said,

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280
 great Master Ghambob said,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280
 what in his teachings,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.280
 teaching said that,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.280
 "Remembering always order to preserve the Bodhisattva.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.280
 Remembering always the benefit of the Bodhisattva.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.280
 Power of the Bodhisattva.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.280
 Benefiting to my Son,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.280
 I have benefited all the certain beings.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.280
 Remembering and never give up the other beings.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.280
 Never, never, never give up.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.280
 Never going to give up any living beings.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.280
 My eye of Bodhisattva,

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.280
 or my compassion of Bodhisattva,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.280
 rather than I'm not going to give any living beings.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280
 Living beings.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.280
 And praying always to Buddha's Bodhisattva.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.280
 May I ever to maintain the Bodhisattva.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280
 Bodhisattva.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.280
 And accumulating merits as much as we can.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.280
 And delegating that merit to maintain the Bodhisattva,

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.280
 to benefit all living beings.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.280
 Those are in the teachings of the great Master Ghambob,

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.280
 highlighted, but it is of course Buddha teaching,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:30.280
 but highlighted that will have to keep up the Bodhisattva,

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.280
 strong and fresh, very authentically,

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.280
 not kind of decline the Bodhisattva.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.280
 I'm expiring the Bodhisattva.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.280
 It will remain precious.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.280
 Precious.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.280
 As it's started, it will remain fresh.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.280
 Not just fresh, it's expanding.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.280
 It's growing.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.280
 It's blooming.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.280
 So that is really the Bodhisattva.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.280
 And now, once we develop this Bodhisattva beautifully,

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:04.280
 then we can enter the actualizing Bodhisattva.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.280
 So that means, the actualizing Bodhisattva is best upon the reaching Bodhisattva.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280
 We reach it.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.280
 And the actualizing Bodhisattva is then principal part of the practices.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.280
 What I do, when we follow the teachings of Lomchima,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.280
 beginning noble, middle noble, so this is the actualizing Bodhisattva is middle noble.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.280
 Middle noble practices without grasping,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.280
 without clinging, and we can.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.280
 That is wishing or actualizing Bodhisattva.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.280
 Actualizing Bodhisattva can be divided into two.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:53.280
 Those are known as Relatrute Bodhisattva and Absolute Truth Bodhisattva.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.280
 So this is.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.280
 And these two truths are Relatrute Bodhisattva

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:07.280
 and Absolute Truth Bodhisattva is summarized within six parameters.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.280
 And this teaching of the Chyabji Dmyurumu cannot come on its own.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:20.280
 And all this, to the end, is teaching on the principal part of the practices.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.280
 Personal, it is within the six paramata practices.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.280
 All in six paramata practices.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.280
 It is the principal part of the practices.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.280
 It is six paramata.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.280
 I listed, of course, you all know.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.280
 We all know there are six paramatas.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:44.280
 For the generosity paramata, morality paramata, patient paramata,

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.280
 and then joyful effort paramata, and concentration paramata,

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.280
 and as well as wisdom paramatas.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.280
 Those are the six paramatas.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.280
 And of course, I will go over those little details at each point

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.280
 as we continue our healing retreat.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.280
 I will go over, and that is my brief talk today about the Bodhisattva.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.280
 So we concluded now, kind of like highlight the principal part aspect

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.280
 of the reaching Bodhisattva and highlight.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.280
 And that is the foundation of all the Buddha's enlightenment.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.280
 And from there, we begin to take that advancing that in path and bhoomis.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280
 We did six paramata practice.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.280
 They called it the context of the six paramatas.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.280
 And then that is the daily practices.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.280
 And so that is my talk.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.280
 And again, thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.280
 And thank you, Pachidili. Thank you.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280
 Thank you, everyone.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.280
 Again, I want to do a short meditative, and then do the healing practices.
