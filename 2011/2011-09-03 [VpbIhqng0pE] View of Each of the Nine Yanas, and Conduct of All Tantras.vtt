00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
 Now, at a little bit about again, in a way, we look back to these nine yanas, and take

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.360
 highlight of their principle views and their meditations. What is the principle view of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:25.600
 the Shavaka yanas? It is egolessness. Ego, "prinned ego" is the principle view of the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.020
 Shavaka yanas. What is the principle view of the Pārthi Buddhas? It is egolessness. Same

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:43.780
 thing, above that, the object is egolessness. That is in the old ways teaching said, "one

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.400
 and a half realization of the egolessness." Above that, bodhisattva yanas, what is that?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.080
 And that is, again, great emptiness from every extremes, and bring to the middle. And that's

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.460
 called Mademaka. And Mademaka doesn't mean there is something to hold in the center.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.640
 Even that relates. That means nothing to hold. Nothing to focus and grasp clean. Every corner

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 of the grasping is gone. Every angle of the grasping is released. Now we are at open state

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 of the sky, vastness sky that has nothing to hold, hold our grasping. Clean. So clean on.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 And then, Kariya Tantra. Sing everything again, same as absolute level, same as Mahayana.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 So the bodhisattva yanas, like adding now the deeds, three principle deeds, adding that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 in a related level and practices. Above that, in Upayana, united together of the will of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 the Kriya Tantra and the Yoga Tantras. In a way, kundra and the will, togya, and that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.640
 is known as Upayana. And then, in Upayana, again, in the absolute level is the same as

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 all, everything, same. And through that, activating the realizations of the whole Buddha status.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.640
 Within that. Above that, what? In the Mahayava, Mahayava status, the total economic status,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 pure and economic status, is the realization or the will of the Mahayavas. Mahayava. And

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 Anayoga, everything is within the middle of the great blissfulness of the bodhisattva.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.640
 And Atayava, everything is concluded within the awareness. Awareness is the ultimate state

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 of the natural and exploring everything from that status. And that is the will of all these

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.640
 yanas. With that, and then we meditate and we practice. As I said so many times, and

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 we all know, this is to practice, we need joy, devotion, bodhicata, courage, and commitment.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 And then all those beautiful kundra in the teaching set. Humble, humility, all that.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 And contentment, and relax, and all that. And that is it.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:51.640
 Now, Togli, you'll be aboard this. What is the conduct of this? This. And each yana,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.640
 this outer tantra, inner tantra has specific instructions how to keep up these practices.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 Those are known as then, how to maintain. Now we've got the will, we've got the meditation,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.640
 but we have to keep up this. This is an expertise instruction as when we plant the seed or when

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.640
 we like to grow, we get tips from the nurses. Similarly, we have to keep up this.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 These are the guidelines that will make us to grow strong, and deep, and healthy, and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:34.640
 bluesal, bluesal. And therefore, this instruction in the teaching is known as then the samayas.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.640
 Samayas are that we have beautiful booklets, are named as sterling skins.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.640
 There's 14 downfall, roots, or downfalls, and eight big ones in the teaching.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 We have beautiful booklet that we translated, as you can see. Those are the principles

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 that encompasses to all the other tantras. And then, each time, also to summarize that,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 we can summarize in the samayas of five dhyana-buddhas, all the guidelines of the five dhyana-budd

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.640
has.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.640
 Those five dhyana-buddhas are the Venerajana, Akhava, Ratna Sambaba, or the Vedya Sattva,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:28.030
 Ratna Sambaba, and Amitabha, and Amogasiddhas. Those are the five dhyana-buddhas, five dhyana-budd

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.640
has.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:37.640
 And these five dhyana-buddhas or rules and guidelines, samayas are, first is, is moralities.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 Last of the Venerajana is moralities. Morality, together with bodhicitta and rafuddhas,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 because that is our foundation. With that big foundation of the morality, bodhicitta, rafuddhas,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 we are going to grow. That is our soil, our grown. Then, with that, above that, what is?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.640
 Morality that encompasses entirely all those dhyana's teachings, we went through roughly yesterday,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.190
 the day before, and all that. Nothing is neglected here, because it is full here for keeping up

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.640
 that.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:29.640
 And then, the Apto-Bhava's bonds are keeping the bell and Vedya. This is the bell and Vedya,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.030
 which means, also, skillful means the wisdom target, that you are holding, the target without separ

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.640
ations.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:46.040
 And then, Rana-Sambhava's or samayas are known as then, then the four generous activities that you

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.640
 perform.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:54.390
 Those are the material generosity, as well as protection, and then the words of the wisdom

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.640
 generosity,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:03.640
 finally, generosity of loving kindness. Those are known as the samayas of the Ratnasana.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.030
 Rata means, what? Luxurious, prosperous. So, you have given abundance of that, and keeping up

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.640
 yourself there,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.640
 and giving that to the others. That is the samaya of the Rana-Sambhava's.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:25.640
 And then, Amidhava's samayas are holding all the teachings, keeping up all the teachings,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:32.890
 both the academic level and the meaning levels. And that is known as the Pia-Drava-Sungra, as you

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.640
 said this time.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 Kepa and Dhrupa, holding up their teachings. All the teachings, the entire teachings of the Buddha

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 Chagtamana,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:50.640
 from the Shravakayana to the Ahti-Yogas, holding up that, keeping up that.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:08:01.640
 And then, what is the samaya of the Amo-Gasanas, performing all the beneficial activities?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:10.640
 It's within the contracts of precautions. And plus, keeping up your commitment, your words,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.640
 such as ceremonial, official, things like timely that what you say to do practice, what you engage,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:25.640
 keeping up our commitment, keeping up our words, not let fail down that on the ground in a ditch.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.640
 And keeping up all those beautiful visions, goals. And then, keep up and share that to the others

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.640
 according to their readiness and capabilities, yours or ours and others.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.640
 That is known as the Brihli Samaya of the Vedayana teachings.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.820
 A very condensed way, a very high, wide way. And we keep that. We are keeping up, then, generally,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.640
 samayas.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.640
 That means, when we keep the samaya, that we are good, developed, we are growing.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.640
 We are deepening and growing. So that is.
