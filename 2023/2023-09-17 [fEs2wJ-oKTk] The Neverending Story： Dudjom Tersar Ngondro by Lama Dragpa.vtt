00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.080
 Thank you, friends. Thank you, friends. Thanks, everyone, for joining in. So the topic of today

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.640
 kind of overarching is the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro. And so then we'll just take a little bit of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.320
 time here at the beginning to kind of just reflect and connect on the Dharma, on the teachings.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.040
 And the topic today, I think I titled it the never ending story, the never ending story.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.720
 And so to begin, as we always begin, try to really reactivate the proper motivation. What

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.200
 we're trying to do here is really like see everything as Dharma. And so doing these prayers

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.960
 that we just did, praying to lamas of the lineage, making an offering of things that

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.320
 we consider precious and sacred in honor of the Dharma, trying to really genuinely connect

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.720
 with the Dharma. We're trying to align ourselves or attune ourselves to really be able to see

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.160
 that the Dharma is everywhere and all the time, outside and inside. We're really trying

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.720
 to become receptive to like just recognize nature happening now in everything happening

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.320
 with us, what we experience, what we think, what we feel, what's around us. This is all

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 Dharma, cause and effect, interdependence. We're kind of unavoidably always in the Dharma.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 The question is, how much do we really connect to that? How much do we really resonate with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.800
 that or see according to how the nature is? So all these kind of preparatory things are

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.560
 trying to intentionally align or activate a certain motivation. They're so important in

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.960
 terms of the Buddha's teaching. Because just not being natural, not seeing clearly like

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.400
 that's the cause of all of our problems, all the suffering we go through and we go through

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.600
 so much suffering. It's just not being natural. It's when we're not natural, when we don't

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 see the Dharma and we don't really let ourselves be Dharma, then that disjunct from our naturalness

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.240
 or just natural relaxed kind of state, natural unconditioned way of being, the degree to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.960
 which we don't see that, that we're not natural, that's how much we'll suffer. So we really,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.080
 it's so important to really genuinely try to really activate this fresh motivation that's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.360
 totally lined up with Dharma. And these lineage masters, we have all these treasures that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.520
 they've given us of how we can so easily line up with Dharma, with our own nature, with

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.720
 each other. And the specific treasure I'm referring to here is how always these great

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 masters including Venerable Kemper Rinpoche's, they remind us to really become suitable vessels

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840
 to recognize the Dharma, to be the Dharma. And that's these three things that they always

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.080
 point to at the beginning of every teaching or every time we study Dharma, every time we

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.760
 practice is to activate our motivation known as renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure perception.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.680
 Renunciation is often talked about by Venerable Kemper Rinpoche is joy and appreciation, gratitude,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:44.040
 gratefulness, a sense of awe and wonder, how amazing this is to really activate that preciousness,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 the kind of precious like fresh vision. Like wow, how amazing it is to breathe now, to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.280
 have the time to just relax and kind of reflect on the Dharma, to try to connect to the Dharma,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.600
 to activate our motivation of love and compassion for all beings. How amazing this opportunity

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.200
 is. This is all renunciation. We're renouncing our close-mindedness. We're renouncing all

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.480
 of our unnecessary tightness. We're renouncing all the ways that we keep hitting ourselves

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.200
 against our own walls. We're letting that go for a little bit of time and we're just

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.180
 to relax, enjoy, enjoy the nature, relax at ease and just be in awe of these beautiful

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.040
 things we have, these simple things around inside of us, right around us, our family

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.660
 and friends, that we have food in our bellies, that we're not dying right now. We have so

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.080
 many luxuries, so many freedoms, right? So really that joy and appreciation or renunciation,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.560
 we're just activating that. And then secondly, bodhicitta, the heart-mind of awakening of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:02.380
 enlightenment. This fresh, deep, kind of tender hearted, kind of strength and courageous vision.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.920
 Every single being, our own nature is utterly happy already. And if we don't see this, we

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.400
 suffer so much. And so for all the beings suffering, wondering, trying to get out of

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.280
 our suffering, we have compassion. I want to help them. I want to help myself get out

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.340
 of this cycle, this kind of endless cycle of suffering. I want to help all beings do

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.240
 the same thing. So by this activity, reflecting on the Dharma, connecting with the Dharma,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.000
 when you practice the Dharma, may this become of secondary conditions, principal secondary

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.520
 condition for every single being to awaken from the nightmare of suffering, to completely

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:54.760
 eliminate the causes of suffering. And then thirdly, pure perception, these three vajras

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.440
 trying to directly experience right now, the pure body, pure speech, pure mind. How is

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.020
 my kind of body when I'm not unnecessarily tight and tense and shut down and locked up?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.640
 How's my speech, my energy, my wind, the circulation, kind of this vibrancy of life? How is it when

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.680
 I can just let it free flow? Just breathe and let it come in, let it go out, let it

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.560
 pause, let it refresh. What's energy like when I just really kind of connect and like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.960
 really I'm in touch with kind of this energy, this breathing, the breath, the air of life?

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.920
 Pure speech, pure mind. What's my mind like when I'm not always kind of caught in trying

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.680
 to either kind of grab something that's not there, push away something that's there, or

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.240
 it is constantly trying to change what's happening instead of just being with what's happening.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.840
 It's already dharma. My mind's dharma, my heart's dharma, your mind's dharma, your

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.480
 heart's dharma, the nature's dharma, environment's dharma, beings around are dharma, it's all

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:10.080
 dharma. How can it not be natural? So in that three vajra view, it can't not be natural.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.520
 It's always all natural. It's always pure body, pure speech, pure mind. There's so many

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.160
 teachings on this. We just take a moment to really try to freshly kind of reactivate this,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.120
 at least for this short period of time together where we reflect on this, where the circumstances

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.520
 are very supportive for this to happen a little more easily. We're not under immediate stress,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:37.000
 immediate pressure. We have a little window to just activate gratitude. Genuinely have

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.080
 a tender heart connected to all beings. May all beings be free of suffering and the causes

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:49.880
 of death. In this natural condition of everything, it's already beautiful. It's already wonderful.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:57.480
 Everything is already in its right place. It's just naturally flowing as part of a system.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:23.000
 Just relax in that for a few moments, activate these three motivations.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:52.880
 [silence]

00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:03.680
 For me to get to say a few words, it's in one way, genuinely exhilarating and genuinely

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:18.400
 embarrassing. It's definitely both. What's going to happen? These are such sacred instructions

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.800
 and teachings we've received. These are just reminders, things of trying to really touch

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:34.400
 into these lineage teachings and really let them kind of move us, like really be moved

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:43.680
 by them. But I'm really just largely reminding myself. And it's good. It's an interesting

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.880
 phenomena that can happen. The more we hear these teachings, the more we know cognitively

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.680
 conceptually like what we're supposed to do. There's what we should do from what we know

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:04.840
 as Dharma people and what we do do, how we actually behave, how our mind actually is.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.000
 And it's an interesting thing that can happen. The more that we receive these teachings,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.120
 there can begin to be a gap between what we know and how we are. And that gap can grow

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.760
 if we just hear the teaching, but we don't really put much energy or effort into actually

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:31.840
 trying to apply it and actually be it, become it. And that gap can become very painful.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:43.080
 This is generally called hypocrisy, where I can I can mow the Dharma. I can talk about

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.480
 this three true wisdoms and the four mind turnings and three, you know, three Vadras

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.240
 states and these beautiful, sacred, profound teachings. But how much am I actually applying

00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:00.640
 in them in my life? How much of the time is my mind really turned towards the Dharma? Because

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:08.200
 it's a beautiful power of one's own mind. If we really start walking a path of self-awareness,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.200
 we're really honestly trying to connect and see what is going on in my mind and my heart

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.840
 all the time. More and more of the time, we're really trying to look. Then we kind of have

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.960
 this first front row seat insider information with this private, very privileged knowledge

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.160
 of how my mind actually is compared with what I say and what I do. That gap can start to

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:40.880
 feel like a big, big pretend, a very big charade. Act like a Dharma person inside and so far

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:49.600
 from Dharma. This is a really big challenge. We don't want this gap to get too big. And

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.720
 that's the beauty of coming together that we can close that gap very quickly. All we have

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:03.040
 to do is apply the Dharma right now. This doesn't have to be some big guilt trip. I never sit

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.040
 down and practice or oh, I haven't done my accumulations or oh, it doesn't have to be

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.760
 held as such a big thing. Right this moment, I can actually try to connect to the Dharma.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:21.360
 Connect on the Buddha, Dharma Sangha. Instantly the gap closes. Instantly I'm with the Dharma.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.960
 I say it's like a cave can be like dark for eons of time, but once you light a lamp, turn

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:34.920
 on a candle, put a flashlight on. The darkness instantly is gone. And it's the beauty of

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.240
 the nature. We can be disconnected from our nature for so long. It's like the Buddha taught

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:47.760
 endless. It's like been beginningless time we've been wondering, but to refresh and reconnect

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:54.320
 to our nature, it can happen right now. This is not an unsurpassable gap. We don't have

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.360
 to just let the Dharma keep being a distant thing. Oftentimes it happens that we have

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.120
 a very specific type view of what the Dharma should be, what I should be like, how I should

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.240
 practice what real practice is in these very tight kind of boxy views. It's like very kind

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.720
 of closed minded, like a really kind of formulaic way of thinking about the Dharma can zap the

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:25.010
 freshness of just this instant and right now opportunity to actually just be kind, be compassionate

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.120
,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:35.120
 compassionate with myself. Listen to someone else aspire to be a bodhisattva. Genuinely

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:42.020
 want to serve the Dharma and other beings. Then we instantly align with the Buddha Dharma

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:49.760
 with the natural, natural systems, the nature that's happening right now. We can kind of

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:58.760
 immediately close the gap when we just kind of refresh that. So let's not like forget

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.960
 in my own mind, Oh, I'm not doing this again. Oh, I haven't done that. Oh, I haven't done

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:11.480
 this. That can just become a very strong laziness where I just don't actually take one minute

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:20.320
 to pick up a Dharma book. It's like this read a read a sentence. Oh, Dharma, I'm not Dharma.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.960
 I haven't done this. So there's all these books. I can't do this. I can't. I can't. I can't.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.080
 And it becomes this laziness that we get stuck in. And it's really kind of very self created.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.400
 So anyway, I know I do that way too much. So it's funny for me to get to say things about

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:45.760
 Dharma now. But I love Dharma. I love Buddha Dharma Sangha. And this is directly related

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.480
 to this kind of topic. I was thinking that the never ending story in one way is kind

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.040
 of cute. The title is like an old movie that if you're old as me and have some gray hair

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.880
 like me, maybe you know this reference, this reference of this kid's movie. I don't really

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.120
 care about this movie. Honestly, it was just kind of cute title. The actual title to this

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:15.600
 teaching is the never ending what? Which I told my wife Amanda earlier today, I was thinking

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.600
 about giving a talk. I'm reflecting on this. I don't initially I thought to call it the

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:28.280
 never ending what she just laughed straight in my face. Right at me. I could don't call

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:35.320
 it that. It's a bad, it's a bad title. Yeah, never ending story. Go with that. What are

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:43.880
 we thinking is going on here? That's really the topic. What do I think is really continuing?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:50.200
 What's continuing? What is this thing happening here? This life, this moment, my life, tomorrow,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:58.240
 today, yesterday, what do I really believe is continuing? The never ending what? What

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.520
 is going on? What keeps going on? What is happening? Where is this leading? When does

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:11.080
 it stop? When does it start? So that's the contemplation of this actually. And it works.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.120
 It is a story. The Buddha really taught all relative truth is artificial, fabricated.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.840
 This story is a fiction. It's always partial. We always get a slice of the pie. Only omniscient

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.360
 ones, fully awakened beings have the whole pie. The whole infinite unbounded boundless

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:37.360
 inconceivable pie. Only the truly unblinking ones have an unmistaken view of all of kind

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:47.200
 of infinitely boundless interactive cause and effect. Every other being has a slice, big

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:55.520
 slices, medium slices, smaller slices, rotten slices, really way too salty slices, all kinds

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:02.920
 of different partialities. But it's all partial for relative truth. If we only get one part,

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.540
 we hold on that one part, that's called a partial view. Usually it's called conception

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.560
 or duality mind. That duality mind has a framework. That framework always leaves something outside

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:22.960
 of its edge. There's always a border to duality mind. This, not that. Yes, not no. Always

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.240
 has a boundary. And outside of the boundary is where we have no clue. We're like totally

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.840
 guessing. In Buddha's bodhisattvas, the really fully awakened ones, they don't have a boundary

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:41.560
 there. They say it's all story. It's endless stories, small story, big story, sub story,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:53.360
 endless. So the reflection here is what do we think is actually endless? What is happening?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.040
 And to just be kind of a little more straight up about this, I know a lot of people and

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:05.940
 myself too, things get too much for me. And I hear this. Too much happening. There's too

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:14.840
 much going on. I can't take it. Too much news, too much information, too many bad things,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.000
 too much juggling, too many responsibilities, too much pressure, too many bills, too many

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.080
 subscriptions, too many choices, too many, too much, too much. Overwhelm. This is more

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.700
 and more. I hear about this more and more and more. I can relate to this, sympathize

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:38.520
 with this more and more and more. But in general, this kind of experience, from my own reflection,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.680
 I'm not saying I'm not out of it. I'm in that. In my reflection, this kind of experience

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:55.240
 is what's going on here, what's continuous. A bunch of crap. Samsara. This is all just

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:05.560
 samsara. Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much. Bad, bad, bad, bad. And if

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:12.080
 we use that view well, we can do a lot of work. We can really get out of samsara. We

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.500
 can become liberated. The four mind turnings, one of them is recognizing suffering for suffering.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:26.520
 The nature of samsara, the nature of grasping conditioned existence is suffering, dissatisfaction,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.680
 fundamentally uncertain. It's disturbing. It's very disquieting. It's fundamentally uneasy.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:40.360
 It's restless. It's really just relentlessly anxious. That's the nature of this graspy

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:48.200
 mind. So if we can use that recognition, that view, it's a partial vision, relative view,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:57.480
 it's actually what's non-graspy mind like? What's it like to not grab it? What's it like

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.640
 to not try to push something away? To not try to unrealistically hold onto something

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:12.520
 when it's leaving? What's that like? This is freedom. The Buddha calls it nirvana. Or

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:24.520
 we could say more colloquially, secularly, natural. Natural. Come and go. But it's tricky

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:31.860
 because if we don't use that recognition of this is really tough, life is really tough.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:38.280
 If we don't use that recognition as fuel to undo our habits of locking up, then we're

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:48.840
 really just grabbing onto samsara more strongly. That's a big danger. Because this world and

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.120
 this experience, all these kinds of things around us, so much of mainstreamness and that

00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:05.240
 is really asking us to be upset and to stay upset. What's going on? Bad news. What should

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:14.040
 I do about it? I don't know, but it's bad. It's not saying what to do about it. Well,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.140
 there's four noble truths and there's a way out of suffering and there's a path and this

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:27.240
 is the steps and I support you to come out of it. Be free. Discover nirvana. Find non-grasping

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:33.400
 awareness, wisdom mind. They don't add that part. But as Buddhists, we really need to

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.520
 remember that part because if it's only the first noble truth and there's no second, third,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.920
 fourth, then it's just suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering. It's not a complete

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:49.960
 path. It's even not even a correct diagnosis because we just say what is the nature, what

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.680
 is the cause of samsara? But we don't recognize nirvana and the cause of nirvana and that's

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:04.720
 very problematic because it's just going to, everything's going to just suck. And then

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.200
 we hear teachings like, oh, it doesn't have to suck. There's freedom. Oh, there's things

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.860
 you can do about it. Do this. And then we still believe this is really just bad. Then

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.000
 there's all these paths and we learn these things, but we're not doing them. Then the

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.600
 gap increases. Then we feel worse and we feel guilty, put all that stuff on. Then it is

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.480
 more and more distant. And then it kind of ends up being this kind of like thing that

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.760
 was good once. And it's really, we really should try to avoid that and we can just instantly

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:37.200
 come together, be together, reflect on the Dharma a little bit, sink into our practice

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.200
 a little bit, ease up, ease up ourselves a little bit, shake it up a little bit, go for

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:51.440
 a walk, call a friend you haven't kind of talked with, ask for help if you need it, write

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.040
 a letter to your teacher. Just make, connect. There's really small, simple things we can

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.080
 do. Come to a beautiful place like this, be together. Consider, oh, someone else is going

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.240
 through something. Really, oh, pray for them. Oh, instead of what's wrong with me, what's

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.000
 bad for me, what's bad. It's like, oh, this person's going through this thing. I really

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.560
 wish this really resolves for them. And they become free of that, genuinely. And then instantly

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:24.360
 your mind's with Dharma. This natural, this compassion just starts coming out and it feels

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.920
 so good. Like there's so much joy in really connecting with someone else. Oh, really?

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:36.520
 Oh, you won that? Well, that happened to you? It was good? Oh, that's so great. I'm so happy

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:42.880
 for you. Yes, it's so wonderful. Instantly, we're just buoyed up. That's totally Dharma.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:53.720
 We're in Dharma, right? That instant. And I'm really practical about these things in one

00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:16.440
 way. I like it. I'm practical, and I'm like magical. I like both. Practically, from a

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:23.400
 Mahayana perspective, most practical thing we can do, honestly, and really kind of standard

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:35.680
 Mahayana stuff, be reborn in Dehvachan. Life is short. There's Rinpoche, Kimbo Rinpoche

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:42.040
 is taught very many times on the four causes of being reborn in Dehvachan. Wanting to be

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.720
 reborn in Dehvachan, having a very clear idea of what that is, activating bodhicitta, doing

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.820
 bodhicitta activities, dedicated for that purpose, and then dedicate the result of those bodhisatt

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.000
va,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:03.520
 bodhicitta activities. So all beings can be reborn in Dehvachan. This is very practical,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:12.240
 and very big view. But why are we trying to get reborn in Dehvachan? Then it comes to

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:21.520
 our belief. It kind of shows us why am I trying to be reborn in Dehvachan. Because the only

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:32.280
 good reason to be reborn in Dehvachan is so I can help other beings more. That's the only

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:42.840
 really good Mahayana reason. This is suffering. Samsara mind is suffering. All the challenge

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.960
 is happening, they're definitely suffering. And I want to put myself practically in conditions

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:57.760
 that make it most easy for my bodhicitta to really shine on bright and steady. And Dehvachan

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:05.120
 is the easy pure land to be reborn into, where all the conditions are going to support that.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.480
 They're going to support that bodhicitta to stay on. And then that's what the teachings

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.480
 say. I believe the Buddha's teachings. Then you go through the boomies, the bodhisattva

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.920
 levels so much more quickly, purify all these negativities, activate all these positive

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.040
 qualities, totally intermingle with all the blessings of the noble ones, where there's

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.920
 always 100% aligned with dharma. They're helping us be 100% aligned with dharma, the natural

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.000
 system happening inside, outside, all around, all the time. When we do that boom through

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.600
 boomy one, boomy two, boomy three, boomy four. Why though? But why? What is never ending?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.200
 Because a reason to go to Dehvachan just to get out of suffering is not the right reason.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.720
 Because this is very interesting, you get into Mahayana logic, logic beyond logic. And

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:05.040
 you get into all these very big view kind of like understandings. Like for example,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:12.960
 time. In Dehvachan, time goes by so much like here, the time kind of a gap between human

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:22.440
 experience and Dehvachan experience. He said something like this, about one day in Dehvachan,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:30.680
 one day in that pure land of Amitabha, is the same in human level and human scale, it's

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.160
 like the entire fortunate eon for humans. All the thousand Buddhas that are going to come

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:49.920
 in the human vision experience is like one day in Dehvachan. Time is flexible. But the

00:27:49.920 --> 00:28:00.920
 Buddha Shakyamuni also taught that this time in our world system, this is of all the eons

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.200
 in all the different phases that universes go through, being born, expanding, staying,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.400
 attracting, dissolving space. Of all these different world systems that have come and

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:19.300
 gone for countless time into countless endless future, right now is one of the best times

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:28.840
 in all of them to actually become enlightened. So that's interesting. We spend one day in

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:37.040
 Dehvachan and if we don't do it well, we're going to miss the most ripe time to serve

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:43.000
 all beings, to be awakened. Because that one day in Dehvachan, all of a sudden all the

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.200
 thousand Buddhas came in our human realm and we missed it. Why? Because we didn't have

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:56.560
 the right view. What we thought was continuing, we thought it was just bad things continuing,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:03.680
 suffering and I have to escape it. We really need to do this as Mayana people, like that's

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.120
 so central to the view is Buddha nature. We have this fundamental goodness, every being

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:18.580
 does. That is what's continuing more deeply. Wisdom mind is what's continuing. Duality

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:25.600
 mind is flicks on and off, on off, on off, on off all the time. It's just like a very

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.040
 quick light that is always on off, on off, on off and it does it so quickly like a flashing

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:36.760
 fluorescent bulb that it does it so fast that it seems continuous but it's not. It's just

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.400
 a really apparition. But if our view gets a little kind of like shut down, we're not

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.560
 as clear, then it seems continuous that duality and all the suffering is just a steady stream

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:57.200
 of everything happening. But actually what's continuous is the Buddha nature. So that's

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:04.440
 kind of a practical thing. This world is really going through things. Everyone sees it. The

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.540
 Buddha taught about it, the degenerate age. It's degenerating. There's also so many beautiful

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:19.840
 things happening. The world really needs us, needs us to really get more steady with our

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:27.620
 bodhicitta. It needs us to not shrink away from the challenge. We can be very practical,

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.120
 put a lot of time into like really trying to like activate our bodhicitta and have a

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.920
 very clear aim of being reborn in somewhere like Dehvachan, having a very optimal next

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.880
 life so that we can really get realization, so we can genuinely deeply help beings have

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:51.160
 much more vision, much more natural, very inclusive, awakened, fresh vision to actually

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.480
 know what is a cause and a condition in a certain situation. So how can we really more

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.320
 effectively help sync up with the situation and really kind of be with it in a more natural

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:14.000
 way? But we're not just trying to escape samsara. Or we're not just even worse trying to get

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.880
 just a really good position in samsara. More famous, more wealthy, more people talking

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.400
 about me, whatever, more all those things, the eight worldly concerns, which we know

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.780
 about which they're just so fundamentally in that sticky mind has all those sticky things

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:34.900
 it constantly getting hung up on. It's just how it is. It's how that sticky mind is. Sticky

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:42.420
 duality mind always grabbing. So we really need to kind of self monitor. Oh, am I really,

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.800
 what am I doing here? Am I really just trying to get bigger position in samsara right now?

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.180
 And then that's worldly motivation. Then a bodhisattva or like, sorry, the so called

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.720
 foundational motivation, self liberation. Am I really just trying to get out of the

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:08.240
 stress of all this so I can be free? Like genuinely out, like out of samsara, like actually

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:13.080
 achieve nirvana, freedom, cessation of all the suffering and the causes of suffering.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:19.160
 That's a good deep motivation. That's a liberation. But all beings were all stuck in these habit

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:27.440
 cycles. Me, me, me, me, me. All of us are stuck in that wondering, drowa beings and anyone

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:35.120
 stuck in that, oh, I really, what can I do to really most carefully, full of care, genuinely

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:44.040
 help serve beings, serve the Dharma to help beings come out of this unrealistic, unnatural,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:53.760
 very partial distorted view of experience. Like a distorted understanding of what's continuing.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.680
 Because fundamentally all these views, the worldly motivation, foundational motivation,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:09.120
 the bodhicitta motivation or bodhisattva motivation, all of them are endless. Cycle keeps going

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:27.760
 around and around. Cause condition effect leads to more cause condition effect. But typically

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.240
 in the more worldly way, I know and I definitely have that personal experience and I definitely

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:42.600
 know people, this is too much. I just want it to stop. And then there's different ways

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:50.320
 of trying to go about not dealing with experience. There's a lot of, you can run it, you can,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:56.360
 you can run away, you can fight it, you can numb out to it. But what basically fundamentally

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:06.360
 we're like, I don't want to have to show up for this escape. There's no escape hatch. There's

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:11.920
 just not, not the worldly view, not the so-called Hinayana foundational view, not the bodhicitta

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:20.200
 view, not the tantra view. There's no end. It really is never ending. And that is just

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:27.480
 even as a conceptualization, as a belief that makes a very significant difference with how

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:38.960
 we are in our lives. Nowadays, big time belief has a very bad rap. Oh, I'm just a believer.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:45.640
 What's it actually your lived experience? Not what do you believe? What's your life like?

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:53.400
 The challenge is our lived experience always filters through beliefs, always as some sarka

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:59.160
 beings. It's called conception. It always is going to duality mind, some duality portal,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:06.580
 some partial vision, some view, tawa, always is going through a view. That's a belief.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:14.680
 Even all the nine yanas, the first eight yanas, they're all filled with beliefs. Conceptualization,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.880
 dual mind, duality mind. It's only ata yoga, zogchen or Mahamudra, the highest ninth yana,

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:29.520
 is it no belief. It's just direct experience all the time. It's not filtered with anything

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:38.200
 that's distorting. But up into that, it all depends on beliefs, views, conceptual views.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.600
 And there's better conceptual views and there's worse conceptual views. And the nine yanas

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:50.640
 very clearly teach this. The ninth yana is better than the ninth yana view is more direct,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:57.640
 complete and detailed than the seventh yana. 100% of the teachings teach that. The seventh

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:03.560
 yana is more direct, complete and detailed than the sixth. There's totally a directionality

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:11.040
 of views in ningma Buddhism. So the question is, these beliefs we use, it's a launch. It's

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:20.360
 like a way to launch into non-conceptual, direct lived experience that's not mistaken. But

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.080
 different beliefs help us launch more thoroughly, more fully, more energetically. So we need

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:33.480
 to kind of acknowledge that. That's why there's study in practice. Study is conceptual belief.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:41.440
 Practice is non-conceptual wisdom. Study, reflection, meditation. Study, contemplation, meditation.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.000
 There's always these three wisdoms. We need to do the hearing study part and the contemplation

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.840
 part. If we don't do those part and we just sit down and try to meditate, what we're going

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:56.320
 to do is we're going to just be meditating on our beliefs and believe we don't have beliefs.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.240
 And it's going to really self-destruct. It doesn't work well. I'm enlightened, I'm enlightened,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.080
 I'm enlightened. So all these beliefs, I want a freedom, I don't want freedom, it's who's

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:12.720
 the I, where's the freedom, how do you get there? It's all beliefs. So we should be really

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.440
 clear about that because the belief that something's continuing and what is it, there's a bad thing

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.140
 continuing and I need to get away from it versus there's this goodness happening and

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:31.320
 I can just like be it. These are very different beliefs. There's a problem here that I have

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:43.760
 to just stop versus there's this amazing, wonderful, infinitely creative natural energy

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:52.200
 system, cognition, awareness, it's happening, Buddha nature. And even just to have that belief,

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.560
 all of a sudden that orients our lived experience fundamentally differently. So there's a lot

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:05.920
 of value in holding these certain kinds of beliefs. So what's continuing? To believe

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.360
 there's Buddha nature and it's continuing. There are freedoms possible. What's the path?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.800
 There's a path, that's a belief. How do I do that? What are the qualities of achieving

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.200
 that? I have all these books here and I really, there's like all these quotes I pulled out

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:28.320
 from all these books and it's kind of like not getting to them. But they're all kind

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:36.800
 of talking about this. What is it like this continuous point, continuous awareness? What

00:38:36.800 --> 00:39:02.840
 is Buddha nature like? What is bodhicitta like? So for future reference, if you want, what

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:09.240
 I kind of really was ringing around for a while is this, if we look at the six parmitas,

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.920
 there's the parmita of joyful effort, virya, then it's subdivided into three. And this

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:22.600
 is in words of my perfect teacher, the great famous book, words of my perfect teacher.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.760
 And it subdivides this diligence or joyful effort into armor like diligence, diligence

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:37.800
 and action and diligence that cannot be stopped. And then Venerable Kemperimica is in the ceaseless

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.530
 echoes of the great silence. They have a similar thing where they go through these same subdiv

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:41.920
isions

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:51.520
 of joyful effort and they call these three subdivisions unflinching courage, insatiable

00:39:51.520 --> 00:40:01.440
 effort, unceasing effort. And so in the midst of like really stress and challenge and difficulty

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.040
 of life, which is definitely there, degenerate age is happening, is very strong being in

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:13.080
 so many things where there's so many moving factors and it's getting more and more complex.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:20.280
 How to have an energy that like really wants to respond and like really deeply keep engaging.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.520
 I want to serve beings, I want to serve the teachings. Instead of this is too much, stop,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:32.960
 I'm out. Even if practically it's like I'm trying to get to dewachin so I can come back

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.040
 really soon to totally be born as a little baby and like plugged into the AI current

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:48.920
 and like yeah, you get to like full on be a bodhisattva with all this crazy AI everything.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.040
 Because that's much more of a bodhisattva view. I've heard that. I've heard that. I've

00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:03.240
 thought that to myself. You know, all this AI stuff, artificial intelligence. I'm glad

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:13.120
 I won't be around to deal with that. I hope, I really hope I get to be born in dewachin

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:21.600
 so I can come back right to the human realm, right on this planet. So I can be right in

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.640
 the middle of this. Because this is the best time for awakening of as many beings as possible

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:34.240
 in so many situations. And now we have this very complex, who knows what's going to happen

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:46.960
 AI factor. And the Buddha said what's going to happen? A lot of degeneration. And also

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:55.840
 this is the best time to wake up. We need bodhisattvas here engaging this stuff. Very

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:04.720
 practically go to dewachin, get on the boomies, and come back here. And simultaneously you

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.600
 can go to all these different realms and receive all these teachings of all these beings and

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.560
 take all these manifestations and help in all these different ways simultaneously. Please

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.040
 do that. I want to do that. Please, please. Like reflections, you know, there's one moon,

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.000
 you put out all these bowls of water. There's so many reflections, as many reflections as

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.720
 there are bowls of water. That the wisdom mind can be like that. Reflect totally just

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.760
 dependent on what's the cause and condition of the bowl and the water. Be that flexible.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.000
 And please come back to do that here. Because this world needs that. It needs bodhisattva

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.520
 activity. It needs bodhicitta blazing bright. And that's why we come to do this dudjimterasar

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.520
 practice together. It's why we reflect on these teachings. Not to just get rid of all

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:57.600
 this suffering, but so we can more elegantly, more creatively, more intelligently be with

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.200
 the richness of life in its suffering and its tragedy and its horror and also its beauty

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:12.320
 and just tender, like amazing connections. Like just heart opening, like just the wonder

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.160
 of how much beauty is here. All these small little ways that everyone's so amazing and

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:26.440
 incredible to really just savor that together. And it's both. And it's always both. And it's

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:32.520
 heartbreaking and it's just heart opening. And to look at these noble ones that are around,

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.480
 that are living and breathing here, that really have accomplished this vision and view and

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.440
 to be in their presence and to learn from them and to receive their feedback and guidance,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.040
 their advice and to try our best to put it into action and to try our best to turn on

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:54.200
 bodhicitta again, to come together as a sangha, to do this again and again so that we can

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.880
 be more affective and like really showing up for each other, showing up for our own

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:07.320
 selves, activating this like Buddha nature right now. This is the never ending story.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.280
 It's definitely, it's going to be never ending. It can either be a never ending nightmare

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:18.080
 or it can be a never ending beautiful story or it can be just this never, this Vajrayana

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:25.120
 view which we haven't really mentioned much. You, continuity, tantra. This isn't a story

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:40.120
 anymore. Every single piece of the fractional, the fractal like ever dynamically embedded

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:46.720
 like matrices of Indra's net is like every single little tiny pocket of it is 100% fully

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:54.560
 awakened already. Nothing has to be changed. It's a continuous enlightened expression.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:01.640
 This is more Vajrayana view. So the pure land is not a way. The pure land is right now.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:07.520
 The pure land is my mind in this emotion happening right now. It's very nature is this enlightened

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.920
 energetic intelligence, love and compassion like boundless. There's nothing that has to

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:21.920
 be stopped. It's always here and happening. Just a question of like being brave enough

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:28.820
 to really let yourself be with it and just fully sync up with it. And I'm definitely

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.800
 not saying I can do that, but I've been in the presence of beings that very clearly can

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:40.460
 and like how important it is to connect with them. Like with that in mind, I really do

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.820
 this due to tears. I'm under a practice and as a final statement to this, which I thought

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.520
 was helpful, is helpful for me to reflect on this. We all want simplicity. This is the

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:58.880
 final summary. We all want simplicity, but we need to be really intelligent and discerning.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:05.040
 Have it really shine on our wisdom. Is the simplicity that we're wanting, is it the simplicity

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:16.560
 that happens before complexity or is it the simplicity that happens after or beyond complexity?

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:24.800
 Because these are very different things. There's like a very challenging situation. Do we avoid

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:31.060
 it and don't want to deal with it? It's too much. And so we're keeping it simple by not

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:38.320
 engaging something that's really very dynamic and kind of like a not easy to understand

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:47.320
 that simplicity before complexity. Or are we like engaging a dynamic situation, including

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.840
 our own minds? Are we trying to see like, what are the deeper ways that this is happening?

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.640
 What are the elegant kind of ways that I can navigate this? Because the Buddha taught these

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:05.360
 so many different instructions. They're called pit instructions that are actually simplicity

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.760
 beyond complexity. The elegant points that bring everything together in a distilled fashion

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:21.600
 that's easily practiceable goes right to the heart. That's simplicity beyond complexity.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:27.200
 It uses the fundamental essential insights of the complexity and it weaves them in an

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:34.440
 elegant, simple way. E equals empty square, right? You don't have to know all the math.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:41.680
 It distills to a single, simple, elegant, comprehensive, non-distortive equation. And

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.280
 Buddhism is filled with this only the liberative ones, not just understanding kind of like

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:52.000
 how reality functions in this certain box, which is so important. But it's how to actually

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.560
 see reality, the way reality is fully, the way enlightened beings see it. And these are

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.440
 pit instructions. And there's two ways to approach a pit instruction. One is just with

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:09.760
 blazing devotion, where we don't have to figure out too much. We have so much connection,

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.000
 so much trust in ourselves and the teachings and the lineage and what the path is, that

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.520
 we can just really keep applying that very pithy simplicity beyond complexity. And when

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.160
 challenges come up, we go to it and challenge comes up and we rely and we rely and we trust

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:31.580
 and we keep going. That's one way. It's very hard to do that way only. It's very hard to

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:38.280
 have that much devotion. Then there's the other way, which is the path of a scholar.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.960
 Like we need to use this analytic mind, logical kind of follow through. Where did this come

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.800
 from? How do I know it's true? Who said, what are the parts? How does it work? Is it true

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:53.160
 in my experience? Does it change when things change in my experience? To really analyze

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:59.360
 this. So we develop this trust over time. And then when challenge happens, we have basically

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.960
 this kind of reserve. We've tested this. This is reliable. Our confidence doesn't just waver

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:11.960
 because we've really tested and we've seen for ourselves over time with study analysis,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.560
 loosening of our partiality. We loosened it to become more inclusive with analysis. We've

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:22.480
 loosened to become more flexible and now we establish confidence like that. And for most

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.480
 people nowadays, it seems like the combination is what we have to do. We do need to analyze

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:32.340
 and loosen to really like see for ourselves and taste and have it kind of go over in our

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:38.160
 minds as contemplation. Then we really can also just save ourselves a lot of time trusting

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.160
 the words of the noble ones, of our teachers, of the Buddha, of Guru Rinpoche, trusting them,

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.920
 including him in the action, seeing for ourselves whether they're true over enough period of

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.220
 time in our lived experience and we'll develop confidence and trust in that way as well.

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.760
 With these two ways, then we can very actively, confidently kind of develop this simplicity

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:02.880
 beyond complexity that isn't trying to reduce or dumb down the complexity. It's trying to

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:09.880
 distill the essence and not waste too much time being lost in the maze of different considerations.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:15.640
 We're still trying to distill the essence based on the guidance of these enlightened

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:21.220
 awakened noble ones. And in our own experience, we're also trying to like really see why that

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:27.720
 makes sense conceptually, cognitively from a duality mind point of view as well. And

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.320
 then we won't kind of try to avoid the complexity because it's just too much. And we're just

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.560
 kind of trying to put our head in the sand because it's just not going to be a very successful

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:48.080
 strategy nowadays. I mean, just straight up. It's just not. We're going to get like, it's

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:54.160
 just going to be a lot of stuff. I mean, there's just a lot of stuff coming that it's not going

00:50:54.160 --> 00:51:01.920
 to be good enough to put ourselves in a bunker with some food and some water. We can try,

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:09.680
 but it just doesn't seem like a very bodhisattva thing to do. Do what you want. But so that's

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:16.080
 my pitch for the simplicity beyond complexity thing. And, but then we'll do that actively

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.840
 in our experience right now by going right to the very condensed, essential pit instructions

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.920
 of the duejum terra sarnundro, which condenses the entire path of foundational view, bodhisattva

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:33.440
 jhana, tantra maha jhana, zogchen, all into a single, very simple, easy to practice set

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:39.240
 of instructions, duejum terra sarnundro revealed by His Holiness, Duejum Rinpoche. So we'll

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:48.440
 go to that now. And then this is, we'll go right into page, I think it's 17 or page 18.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:53.080
 A term of revelation of His Holiness, Duejum Rinpoche wrote this as kind of like a mind

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.880
 term on this prayer, prayer of calling the Lama from afar, spontaneous song, the original

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:05.280
 nature. So first we'll recite the seven line prayer once that's on page 14 in the daily

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.360
 prayers. We'll recite it once because we already did three times earlier. And then we'll go

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.160
 right to this spontaneous prayer, calling the Lama from afar. And we'll recite this

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.280
 in English and then go into the duejum terra sarnundro altogether. So thanks so much, friends.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:36.360
 Really heartfelt, thanks. Great. Appreciate the time. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you friends.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:43.520
 Thank you so much. Dharma family. Thank you. Thank you. If you have like two more minutes,

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.600
 I have like a summary thing to read. This has been something that I've really cherished

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.920
 for so long. This comes from this book by Zoekser Kentsen Rinpoche, Not for Happiness.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:00.480
 And it's his chapter in here on the preliminary nundro practices. It's the chapter on bodhicitta.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.640
 And this has been, for me, one of the most significant chapters on bodhicitta I've ever

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.760
 read. It's just so many insightful things that I'm really so thankful to contemplate.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:18.440
 And then one of these, I'll just read this. It's so deep. It's page 114. And the subsection

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.760
 is called Develop the Strength of Compassion. So this is kind of the topic of dealing with

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.520
 a continuous challenge, as well as the continuous goodness, Buddha nature we all have. So how

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.120
 to actually develop the strength of compassion. It goes, until we have established a complete

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.840
 understanding of bodhicitta, we will continue to make the mistake of imagining that pain

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:49.000
 truly exists. As a result, we will almost certainly become the victims of our own compassion.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.120
 And without fully appreciating non-duality, our every activity will lead to disappointment.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.920
 For example, as a therapist, how far are you prepared to go to help an alcoholic or drug

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.960
 addict? Imagine that one of your clients is certain to be reborn a drug addict from the

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:14.240
 next 5,000 lifetimes. As a bodhisattva, your determination to help her should be so great

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.040
 that you aspire to be reborn at the right time and in the right place during every one

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:29.820
 of those lifetimes so you can continue her treatment. Fast forward to the 5,000th lifetime.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:35.160
 Your client has been reborn in a lonely, God forsaken country, and all you have to do to

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.240
 ensure that she will never again be reborn as an addict is to hang out with her for half

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:46.640
 a day. This means that you must also be reborn in that wretched place and that the entire

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.720
 focus of your life will be to get you to the right place at the right time to spend those

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.400
 few hours with your client. To do this, you will need what the teaching describes as strength

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:06.040
 or determination. And you will only find this strength once you come to realize the illusory

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:12.720
 nature of all phenomena, or in other words, emptiness. So how do you develop the remarkable

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.620
 strength of compassion you need to be able to behave so selflessly? How do you develop

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:23.080
 the determination to never give up? Where do you find the confidence and tenacity to

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.340
 keep trying? Every one of these qualities springs from the realization that the drug

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:33.960
 addict, her problem, that she can be healed, and even the idea that she needs healing at

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:41.120
 all are merely the products of your own mind. None of it truly exists outside the mind.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:47.080
 And having realized this truth, you can go on to develop the strong and genuine compassion

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:54.400
 that is bodhicitta. In the Prasanaparamitra Sutra, we are told that Buddha was once approached

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.320
 by a bodhisattva practitioner who complained that, having dedicated many years to helping

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:05.880
 sentient beings, he was now utterly exhausted. Buddha responded by explaining that time is

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:12.440
 relative. The bodhisattva-yana teachings tell us that the period between the moment a bodhisattva

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:19.880
 first takes the bodhisattva vow up until his last moment on the 10th Bhumi lasts for three

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:27.320
 countless aeons. Yet one of the realizations of the 10th Bhumi bodhisattva is that all

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:39.720
 of those countless aeons pass as quickly as it takes for a spark to shoot out of a fire.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.960
 And this is just also pointing towards absolute bodhicitta, that we have to really recognize

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:51.800
 that to the flexibility of our mind, of our awareness, of experience, and that really,

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:57.560
 in order to keep again and again showing up for our lives, showing up for each other,

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:03.160
 showing up for the dharma, and to have that resolve to keep doing this until all beings

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:10.280
 are free, that we really need to have this absolute, to grow this absolute, like dream-like,

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:16.920
 absolute bodhicitta too, that that's so vitally important. And I say that for myself so much.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:23.000
 Without wisdom, this path won't work. It's all oriented towards prajna, our wisdom,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:31.080
 absolute bodhicitta. And compassion alone is not enough. It's not enough to just really care,

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:38.280
 that if we don't really develop that insight or that vipassana, that wisdom, to seeing the

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:43.560
 real nature of things, of our mind, of experience, it's just in the end we're just going to be

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:49.800
 exhausted and we'll give up. So really, that in mind, we don't want to give up. We need to also

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:56.680
 really kind of get a taste for the absolute bodhicitta, the imaginary, kind of illusory,

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:03.080
 flexible nature of ourselves and others in this world we're a part of. So thank you so much,

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:09.080
 friends. I aspire for all of us to actualize that, myself included, and we follow in the footsteps

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:13.320
 of the Buddha and the noble ones to really make this happen as soon as possible for all beings.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:21.800
 Great. Thank you. Thank you.
