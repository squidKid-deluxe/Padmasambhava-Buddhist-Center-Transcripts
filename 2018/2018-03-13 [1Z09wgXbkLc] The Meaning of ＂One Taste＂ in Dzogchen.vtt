00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.930
 I made a choice of the five or six senses I made, such as the "up," "home," "smell," "taste," "t

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.000
ouched," "touched" and "consulted," all that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 All that variety goes, all that. But reality, where there comes goes, when you see these things.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 That's what reality must say. When you, when you, when you are in this again PB11, when you realize

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.000
 this, it is all "one taste" within the awarenesses.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.260
 Even you see "home," even you see "song," or hear the song, and all those different things, you see

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.000
, "oh, this is song, this is that thing," all that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.870
 But where that, where that knowledge, where that knowledge, where that memory, where? It's the mind

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.000
.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 When you come to the mind, what is it called? There is no different department that we can find.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.370
 Or that is the recognition, recognition of the poem. This is the recognition of the song. This is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.000
 the recognition of the taste, the smell.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.980
 So I tell you, in the mind, no. None of those exist. It's called, that's why it's called "one taste

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.000
," "one place."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Where that mergant, back to that source, what we're talking, back to that ground, to that ground,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 it's merged back to that status.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 That status, for that reason here, great masters, masters said, when you realize this, it is all "

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.000
one taste" within the awarenesses.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:12.680
 And when you have that realization, that moment, here, let's align it. That moment, subject and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 object merge with the wisdom beyond the dualities.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 That moment, when you see this "one taste" in the text, when you have the realization of the "one

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.000
 taste," that moment, it is, then, pre-provisional dualities.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.080
 There's no subject. There's no object. Object. All merged. All merged without any trace, without

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 any parent.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Merged. And then, therefore, there's no dualities. When there's no dualities, what is that?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That is primordial, pristine awareness, primordial, pristine awareness or primordial wisdom.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 That is the wisdom. And you'll be holding the exact nature of the mind as it is. We'll be holding

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.000
 that.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And when you have that realization, what is the energy, you said here?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Instantly and powerfully, by these techniques, habit appearance and dualities are uprooted.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.490
 This technique, when you just behold the nature of the mind, exactly as it is beyond the dualities,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:52.000
 that moment, then, the one uprooted, habit appearance and dualities.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 It's uprooted. It's uprooted. It's also uprooted means it's completely pre-provisional.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It's nothing that's subject or object to be uprooted.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.890
 That instantly, duality, habit appearance are liberated within that organic, natural state of the d

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.000
harmakaya or that ground, that ground of our own, ground of all.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.220
 It's instantly removed. It is dissolved, dissolved. And when that happens, when that happens, or

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:42.350
 this moment, then again, here, Giriravastri, as in every emphasizing, that moment, the essence of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.000
 the wisdom is you behold.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 You behold the essence of the wisdom or the primordial wisdom. You behold.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And when you behold the primordial wisdom, what is there to see?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 There's nothing that you can see, that can say the colorful things we see.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.660
 See, what is there? When you don't see, and the teaching says, when you don't see anything, that is

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.000
 supreme sense.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.860
 When you don't see, that is supreme sense. So, you reach to the speech elastics, speech elastics,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.000
 and beyond the conception.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 The open, brilliant, and clear, that says, really shine, and you behold that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:42.190
 For that reason, this part of the Dzogji teaching is known as the speech part, or very part that

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.000
 brings the realization so quickly.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:57.730
 Therefore, that is known as the swear to part, and swear to part quickly gets the realization of

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.000
 the enlightened person.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.810
 And those fortunate beings in the teaching say, well, they're sitting down on the ground, or on the

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.000
 cushion.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.440
 Maybe they are all the beings, and when they're married and for a short time, when they're raised

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.000
 up from the cushion, they're already Buddhas.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So, sitting down as a samsara, deluded beings, getting up as enlightened beings.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 That has happened to such as really great masters, or great those that port to the enlightenment.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Examples such as like, this Bangui Mohan Gombo in the teaching said, Bangui Mohan Gombo.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And he was one of the first leading student of the great master, Verojana, Bangui Mohan Gombo.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.350
 And he was very old, also many times, many histories, it depends, but some histories that he was

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.000
 old as like maybe in the 90s, that approach.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And when he was in the 90s, then his relatives and families all become not so nice to him.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.360
 He's so kind of like dispelled, but he heard the reputation of the great master, Verojana, who is

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.000
 that time in East Tibet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.800
 So, he's really hoping that he will see this great master in a resistive teaching, but then he can

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.000
't travel to where Verojana is.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.600
 And so, he's really waking always. For one time, he heard Verojana is returning from East Tibet to

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.000
 Central Tibet.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And then the path on the road of the Verojana is where he's waiting.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.280
 And then the teaching said that he waited and he met Verojana, and Verojana gave the teachings of

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.000
 the doctor-teachers.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And he was so happy, so delighted by this even the teaching and meeting the Verojana.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 And he saw that even he hugged the Verojana and really let go for a while, and long off, hugged.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.900
 And he's so happy. And he put the practices, and soon after he become one of the great Dzokhi

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.000
 masters.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 He sold after very quickly. And the teacher said that he is one of the highly capable practitioners

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 of capable students by visiting the Dzokhi teaching.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And very soon, he become the total enlightenment. He got a leg as like rainbow boaters.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And not just only that, after 70 generations from his students, one after another,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 they all got rainbow boaters. One after another.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Those are known as the radial chain of the space section of the Dzokhi teaching.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 One after another, they all got so very light.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.290
 And like this, I mean Dzokhi teaching, every really practicing meditation, as teaching, has stopped

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.000
 it.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And then we get good results. Even it really gets enlightenment or become as like Pangi Mohan Gombo

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.000
.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 But yet, really we will get good proof, good results.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And that is the reason the teaching is about the teachings.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 And also, when we meet or receive such a great teaching or connect with this great teaching,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 that means we are also a candidate of these practices.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 It's not something we are not a candidate. We are a candidate. We are connected with this teaching.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Connect with this teaching. And since we received this as a great teaching or we can connect with

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 this great teaching,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and we are a candidate, we are a candidate to be able to connect with this,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 and we apply this teaching by heart, and call it instructions in teaching.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Truly, we will make a difference. We will make a difference.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And what the great master, what is it?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Have you realized this in life, within these lifetimes? That's wonderful.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Even if you didn't get enlightenment by practice at least, as much as we can do,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 with it, with it, according to instruction, we will lead this world with joy,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 with peace, with confidence, and with the destination.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 That's what the great master is talking about.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 This is really true. This is very, I mean, for that reason,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 this is known as the swept past.
