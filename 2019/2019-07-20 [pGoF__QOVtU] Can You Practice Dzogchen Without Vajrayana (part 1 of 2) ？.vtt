00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820
 Thank you very much. I have a question about being an appropriate vessel for inner Tantra

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 in Dzogchen teachings. So it seems like so many times during these teachings you've emphasized

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.760
 very carefully following exactly the lineage instructions. And in that context, if we look

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.240
 larger in the world, especially with meditation happening in a lot of new places, like the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:43.080
 mindfulness movement and things like this, sometimes there's an approach where if you

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.560
 have mindfulness and then you relax, then that's Dzogchen and you can skip this whole

00:00:50.560 --> 00:01:00.320
 Tantra apart. Like Vajrayana, you can skip. So would you please comment on what that is?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.520
 These kind of things happen throughout the centuries in ancient Tantra too. And when

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.400
 Buddhism came to Tibet, definitely those things happened. And now it's happening. I can't

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.080
 really exactly make comments, but according to teaching, according to the lineage instruction,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.960
 teaching should not change. There's no like 21st teaching, 20th century teaching, 19th

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.760
 century teaching, 18th century teachings. Teachings should be the same teaching. Because

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:51.040
 the water is never changed. 19th century water, like 17th century water, 18th century water,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.360
 19th century water, 20th century water, and 24th century water. Water remains the same

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 as FFP. That is pure water. And we started changing the water, what that water we call

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:21.800
 Ramayana. Is it diluted or polluted? Artificial. That's not organic water. So therefore, consulting

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.280
 can create all those different things. But what I follow, what I see is that nature,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.880
 nature is natural. It benefited to the beings and the ancient times, or the beginning of

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.960
 the century, and the older centuries, exactly the same. But we try to change these and the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.320
 things. I will say it's not exactly what the Buddha taught, or the Virabhama sama taught.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.160
 Then Popo can do that. It's everything. It's freedom. And now, too, in the ancient time,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.960
 you read life story, history. There are so many things that can happen. And in the time

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.080
 of Atisha, in the Tibetan, the Buddhism came, and it is destroyed by the great, great son

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.080
 of Chisong Deppi. And all the systems broke in all that. There are so many, kind of like,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.320
 these new things that I did came, and Buddhism is very different. But in the teachings, that's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.880
 why Atisha came, and it is strengthened and incorrect. Atisha is one of the really instrumentals

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.320
 to help them there. So that is my answer, and I can say more than that.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.160
 Okay, thank you, everyone.
