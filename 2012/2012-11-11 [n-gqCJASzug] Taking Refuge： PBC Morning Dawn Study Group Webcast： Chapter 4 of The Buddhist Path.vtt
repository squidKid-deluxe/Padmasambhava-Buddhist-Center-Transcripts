The seed or cause for taking refuge is a feeling of interest and closeness to the three objects of refuge: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the sangha. On the outer level, the Buddha is the person who gave the teachings; he is the guide. The Dharma is the teachings; it is a guidebook that describes where to go. The sangha are the beings who follow the path described by the Dharma.\" (pg 23, first paragraph)\n\n2. \"The three refuges also have an inner meaning related to the mind. The mind's primordial nature is totally pure, clear, and enlightened from beginningless time. One's own pure awareness is the primordial buddha. Buddha actually means the perfect understanding that is free from all deluded and dualistic thinking. This is the absolute buddha. ... Maintaining the qualities of the primordial nature and radiating them to all sentient beings is the inner meaning of taking refuge in the absolute Dharma. ... The inner sangha is also contained within the mind. ... This refers to the inseparability of clarity and emptiness as the true nature of the mind. ... Clarity and emptiness are always present, and that is the meaning of the absolute sangha.\" (pg 23, paragraphs 2-4)\n\nTo download the pdf of all the Main Topics, Concepts, and PBC YouTube Videos to refer to for this PBC Morning Dawn Study Webcast, go to the main \"Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\" Facebook page: www.padmasambhava.org/facebook\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 Welcome to the fourth webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group at Palmasamyalang. Today we'll

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080
 be discussing the fourth chapter of the Venerable Khe BJPo Rinpoches, "The Buddhist Path",

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.920
 which is entitled "Taking Refuge". So we'll begin with opening prayers.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.720
 Sathamantavadra, Bhaktasatha, Pramanavadra, Sri-sinkha, Padma-kara, the 25 King in subjects,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.000
 So-Zor-Nod-Nang, the 100 Tritons, and others, the Lammas of the Kama, the terminal images to you,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 I pray. The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha, Padma-sambhava, which is the essential,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.840
 extraordinary viewer and doctrine of the early translation school, you keep alive and spread by

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.560
 the light of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great temple, I pray at your lowest feet. In the palace of the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.000
 old man Dharmadaptu, the essence of all the Buddhists of the three times, the one who shows

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.640
 clearly the Dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honourable Rupa Guru, glorious Rupa teacher,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 precious one, dwelling on the lowest seat on the crown of my head. Hold me with your great kindness

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:28.960
 And so we're beginning this today's discussion group. We're going to be talking on the fourth

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:38.560
 chapter from Rinpoche's book, the Buddhist Path, which begins on page 23. And so the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.160
 subject is taking refuge and kind of the main points of the kind of first section that we're

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.640
 going to be going over are really what it is to take refuge and looking a little more at that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.160
 outer meaning of refuge. And so basically the main points that Rinpoche's go across

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.120
 are that refuge is taking the first step in practicing Buddhism in all the Buddhist traditions,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:21.120
 Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana, and that the seed or cause of taking refuge is that closeness

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.760
 feeling

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 and interest in what are known as the three objects of refuge, which are namely the Buddha,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.800
 Dharma, and Sangha. And then they go over a little more on what the outer meaning of taking them

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.280
 are,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.040
 Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. That's really the first main points.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.640
 Directly from the book, the first point is the first step in practicing Buddhism according to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.280
 the three traditions of Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana is to take refuge. The seed or cause for

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 taking refuge is a feeling of interest and closeness to the three objects of refuge, the Buddha,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.640
 the Dharma, and the Sangha. On the outer level, the Buddha is the person who gave the teachings,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.160
 he is the guide. The Dharma is the teachings, it is a guidebook that describes where to go.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.560
 The Sangha are the beings who follow the path described by the Dharma.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:35.280
 One of the things that came up for me while I was reading.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.080
 So I was thinking about the quality of refuge because I think, particularly for people who

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.000
 are new to this, like myself, one of the things that can almost become a little confusing is how

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.640
 once taking refuge on an outer level, we're making a prostration, or however we take refuge

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.520
 in something very physical that's considered in front of us, that's considered very external.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.560
 But then we're going to go into this a little bit later about how there's the inner level too,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.400
 and all the different levels, which makes it not as external. So what's the kind of quality

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.240
 that one takes, particularly when you're looking at the outer level of refuge,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.680
 that not only respects that outer level of the Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha, but then

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.720
 also respects the fact that we're going to be sinking into all these different levels.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:43.760
 I don't know, it seems to me it's definitely recognizing that they're connected,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:55.520
 that really outer inner is connected. And so I don't know, and in this case, I mean,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.440
 ultimately the Buddha said, "We all have Buddha nature and we all can realize that, all beings

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:11.280
 without exception." But because we do have ignorance and ego clinging and that we are

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:21.280
 obscured, then we have something to look to and to move our mind toward. So in this case, we have

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:30.720
 Buddha Shakyamuni, who is the expression in this world of all these inherent beautiful qualities

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:38.320
 that everyone has. And out of that limitless compassion of Buddha Shakyamuni is all of the

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.720
 teachings, our expressions of his wisdom and compassion, and all of those beings who've

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.480
 taken those teachings to heart and practiced it then. And like Rinpoche's mentioned, whether they

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.560
're

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.520
 other ordinary people or those who are hearts and bodhisattvas and all of the

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:06.640
 fully realized Buddhas, the noble Sangha, we have their support. It's like kind of that guidance

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.600
 and that support and these clear kind of reliable instructions to put to view. So

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.440
 it's kind of that we realize. They themselves are expressions of those beautiful inner

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.920
 qualities shining forth, but ours are a little more obscure. So then we have these beautiful

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.160
 examples and these living lineage masters and all of those things to connect with on the outer.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.960
 You know, I think that's what it means by outer. These are the things coming that we have to look

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.560
 toward and connect, begin to connect with us. I mean, I'm sure if anyone else says.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.120
 Yeah, that just reminded me of something nice that I read in this, eliminating the path.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.640
 I'm just kind of, you know, on this topic of refuge that just right in the very beginning,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.160
 there's a nice quote of Vimalamitra that says, "When we clearly know the suffering of samsara,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.240
 as well as the qualities of enlightened beings, then we can go for refuge." So it's just kind of,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.680
 it's, you know, really to the point, but it's just so beautiful. It made me kind of imagine that,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:20.000
 you know, through duality mind, we have this gap. We see a gap between ourselves and enlightened

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.400
 beings, you know, and there is, you know, if we have duality mind, there is a gap. But this process

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.160
 of taking refuge is this first step of closing that gap of saying, oh, you know, there is samsara,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.280
 there is suffering, there are sentient beings, and there are enlightened beings who have totally

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.080
 removed that and totally, fully touched that Buddha nature and, you know, completely revealed that

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.240
 without, you know, ever going back. And so that taking refuge is really like that, acknowledging

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:57.790
 that and seeing, wow, this is something extraordinary and, you know, something that I can, I'd like

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.920
 to

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.920
 do too, you know, so it's kind of the bridging the gap for the first step. I think it's really,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.600
 like a really important part is that what you said in that first statement, like seeing samsara

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.520
 clearly, and that's on the outer level, like we need to take refuge. If we have these troubles,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.120
 we have these ways we get caught in ups and downs and good times, bad times. If we have this

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.640
 fluctuating based on our grasping, there's no other choice but to take refuge in something that's

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.040
 reliable, stable. I mean, if we don't see the ups and downs of life as being a problem, or if we

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.760
 think it's unavoidable, then we won't go for refuge anyway, because we think that's just how it is.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.880
 There's nothing stable in life. But then if we see, oh, is there something stable in life? Is

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:54.240
 it possible to have a complete lasting, unchanging happiness to benefit all beings? Then if we see

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.720
 that as a possibility, like you said, or Vimala Mitra said, we see this enlightened quality so

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:09.840
 that is possible, then it becomes a very strong, urge, not stable yet, they're stable. Then it's

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.480
 just a question of relying on something like, oh, how can I actually actualize that myself?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.680
 And refuge is a very practical, outward-level refuge. What other option do we have

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.280
 if we're not stable already? And it seems like that is that first moment of

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.800
 moving from it being external to it being more internal, because it is external until you start

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:40.320
 to see, like, that you can see it in yourself a little bit, you know, oh, I do have for the

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.400
 nature a little bit, you know, and then a little more, a little more, a little more, until, you

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.560
 know,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.630
 along the path of the whole way. So that's that, to me, that's that process of moving from the

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.000
 external

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.840
 to the internal. What you're both saying sounds like the Four Noble Truths first are studied

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:05.040
 to understand the suffering, and then the path, the beginning, you take refuge. So what Vimala

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.480
 Maitreya said first, you understand the suffering, which is from, like, the Four Noble Truths, and

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.880
 the last is the path. You take refuge and join this is the path.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:27.280
 I think, well, I think what both of you all said, I mean, is it, it's a, from the, from the outer

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.880
 level, like, I think here, you can really distinguish between the Hinayana, the Mahayana,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.640
 and the Tantrayana, and make it as complex or deep as you want to go, because within the

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.520
 Vajrayana, there's the outer, the inner, the secret, the ultimate, that's just the Vajrayana.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.240
 But I think the basis of refuge, like, like you guys were saying is, we need help, you know,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.080
 like, we're not enlightened, you know, we're struggling. And from the Hinayana point of view,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:04.480
 you take refuge in the symbolic outer three jewels of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha as an external

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:12.480
 thing, that's the, that's the object. And then the duration is, for example, for this lifetime,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.080
 you take refuge for this lifetime, and the scope is the reason the motivation is because you fear

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.520
 the sufferings of samsara, because you're, you're in trouble, you fear samsara and all the bad

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:25.600
 things

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.720
 that can happen there, so you take it that way. But then once you get to the Mahayana, it's, it's

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:38.800
 already a, it's a different thing, because the object is like the, the Dhamma Kaya, the Sambhari

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.400
 Kaya, the Ramana Kaya, the duration is until you attain enlightenment, you know, complete

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.960
 enlightenment forever. So you take refuge from now until I attain enlightenment, that's when you

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.120
 take

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.000
 refuge. And then for, and then the motivation is not just for yourself, because you fear the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.160
 suffering

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.240
 of samsara, but because all beings are in, are in trouble and going through the difficulties. So,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.480
 so I take refuge until I attain complete enlightenment and lead all beings to that

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.800
 state of enlightenment. So it gets like, in that sense, like Lodra's question, it gets

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.600
 you know, deeper and deeper and deeper. It's not like they're separate things, but it's just like,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.800
 you know, then you can keep going there from like the Vadryana, you know, into the Vadryana, you,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.480
 but basically we know we won't get, take refuge in money, because we've tried and it doesn't work,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.520
 you know, we can't take refuge in something unstable. So ultimately you have to take refuge

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.480
 in something that's beyond samsara, because you can't take refuge in samsara. So the only thing

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.400
 beyond samsara is, well the major ones online is always beyond samsara, but the one who fully

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.280
 realizes that through the wisdoms and the kaidas is a fully enlightened Buddha. That's what you,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.040
 that's what you have to take refuge in.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:05.600
 The thing I was thinking of was connected with what you were reading was that how this ties back

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.560
 in with those three kinds of faith, the three kinds of devotion, that you have that inspiration,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.240
 that aspiration, and then the certainty, and so you take refuge. So it's very, very closely

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.720
 connected.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.280
 All these topics are really like the refuges, they all support each other.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:27.440
 Maybe elaborating? I'm curious, like when the different levels are...

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.680
 Well, I was just thinking in terms of these, these kinds of fundamental teachings that,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.240
 like Dara's pointing out, how there's refuge. I mean, how the refuge is connected with four

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.880
 noble truths in terms of seeing suffering and its cause, seeing the path, you know, and its

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.200
 fruition, and so you take refuge. And then just the same with the three kinds of faith that, you

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.360
 know,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:00.160
 you're inspired by, say, seeing the Buddha. You aspire to be like him. You know, you have this

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:07.280
 conviction after you really look into the Dharma that it's actually true, and you see noble beings

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.730
 who are following it, and so you have this certainty that, yes, this is something I can take refuge

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.000
 in.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.200
 And it's just, it's just so profound. I mean, just like what we're all saying, like

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.280
 you can see Rinpoche say, also in this Illuminating the Path, but at the very end,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.360
 the last point they make is that refuge is such a profound practice that really it could be your

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.040
 only practice, and you would achieve the full result only through this practice. And it's just

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.280
 really, wow, you know, like everything we're saying, you can kind of see why that's true,

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:49.440
 because it's really like this umbrella that does kind of hold all the essential, the essential

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.680
 meaning of Buddhism, and the Dharma, and the Path. It's really everything in a sense.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:03.200
 The English word refuge, right? It's a shelter we seek. I mean, somebody could be in a dictionary,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.090
 but it's the shelter you seek in times of need, right? It's a refuge, right? Or something like that

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.160
.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:20.400
 But, so, getting to the point of realizing the only use, you know, the only things, the only

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:33.840
 activities or thoughts that are going to provide you with this safe haven, this place to find

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:41.840
 respite, you're going to be within the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha somehow, right?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:51.600
 So you sort of give up, like you said, give up the idea that something other than within that,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.640
 within that ambit, or whatever you would say, is going to give you what you need, you know,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:08.320
 money, or alcohol, or, you know, it's sort of like a promise you're making, is that

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:17.680
 I will go to these things. I will make an effort to look at my mama, look at my Sangha, and listen,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:25.200
 read the Dharma to find the answers solace, or at least comfort. It's beautiful, too,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.080
 because the Sanskrit word Dharma translates directly to protection. I've seen it translate

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.840
 a number of ways, but one of them, I think, particularly even in the book here, either

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.160
 the Buddhist path or illuminating the path, you know, it translates to protection.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.360
 Right there, yes, page 23. Yeah, and then refuge is also translated as protection, and I think

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.320
 it's in this book, so it's just beautiful, just like that sense of why is it a protection,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.200
 and it's really that, like what you're saying is that, or they'll use the word infallible,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.440
 they're infallible, like there's all these other things that we might really try and just keep

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.440
 trying, you know, but they really, at some point we see they really don't work, and that with

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.480
 contemplation, and really looking at the Buddha, and the Dharma, and the Sangha, and why, and why,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.800
 they're really, like, unfailing, you know, I love that word they usually use in prayer.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:27.120
 And I think, like what Anne talked about, too, the way that the devotion and interest, like that

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:36.650
 element, too, as much as how, just how vital that is, and the more we look at the Buddha on any

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.960
 level,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.720
 it just inspires, and all the Buddha's beautiful qualities, and life stories, and previous lives,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.960
 and then all the different levels of the Buddha, you know, outer, inner, secret, whatever, and the

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.400
 same with the Dharma, all the words of the Buddha, all the meanings, all the three basket, I mean,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.680
 everything, you know, just the more we become familiar, all the Sangha, their life stories,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.040
 their qualities, and abilities, and, I mean, just all of that, just, like you said, I mean,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.960
 it's just so complete, like, within, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha holds everything, every level,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:23.280
 and then inspires, like, that devotional, like, like, thing that just, you know, opens.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.520
 I think that's why it can be a concrete path, is because of that, is because that's,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:36.720
 that's what we're trying to do, is really open fully, you know, our hearts, and our minds, and

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.600
 that's what, that feeling that you're talking about, or that inspiration, and devotion,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:48.560
 and appreciation, which is always remind us of, you know, our encompass within refuge.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:58.960
 And that confidence to stay open, and, and live in your softness. Yeah, you know what I mean?

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.280
 It's like anything else that we would look to, there's always maybe this edge of,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:10.000
 how can I be sure? So, so it's in those times of need, if you have a place that you can go with

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.080
 ultimate confidence, and know that for thousands of years, these teachings, and it has, you know,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.360
 have really brought people to, to other places, and staying open in that softness, even in

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.360
 all kinds of moments. That's, that's something you're gonna find at work, you know, or,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:39.760
 you know, or any other places that we have gone in the past to find that feeling.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.560
 Yeah, and I wanted to kind of follow up too, on what Lyle was saying too, in terms of seeing how,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.320
 but just that whole sense of, you know, that the more you explore the Buddha, the Dharma, and the

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.770
 Sangha, it's like, endlessly rich. You can never really get to the end of the Dharma, there's

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:02.160
 always

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.360
 more to uncover, in terms of one's own mind and heart, you know, there's just, there's always

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:16.240
 more, it's just, it's limitless. So, so wonderful. Yeah, and when you connect with that, it's like,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.800
 I always love when, you know, like, we've all seen, I think most of us, I think we've all taken

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.280
 refuge

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:28.400
 here, but, you know, like, when you see somebody who they're like, "Oh, I'm taking refuge!" You

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:28.560
 know,

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.080
 like, "I want to take refuge, like, on Saturday," or whatever, like, everyone who comes through

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.400
 here,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.480
 and that feeling, and that quality, it just has, you know, I think the essence of refuge, you know,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.280
 somebody's like, they're excited, they're uplifted, they're, you know, you see them after they take

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:49.120
 refuge, they have a new name, it's like a birthday, they feel like it's the beginning of the end,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.200
 you

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.560
 know, it's the beginning of the end of all this wandering, you know, and you see people, and you

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.010
 feel they're, you know, like, it's just such a, it's such a happy thing, yeah, and I think that's

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.320
 the

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.310
 partially, that's the essence of refuge, you know, even if we talk about all the different levels

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.520
 and

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.800
 depths and details, but the essence is, if we remember that, and we connect with that, and like,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:17.840
 why are people so happy when they take refuge? They're so happy because the chains are falling,

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.290
 you know, it's like this story in Tibetan, just a really quick story of this bandit who he was

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:23.520
 going

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.160
 through the, maybe I won't tell correctly, but he's going through the town, he's a robber, he's a

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.480
 bandit, he steals something, he steals something from the town, and he runs, and people chase after

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:41.920
 him, he runs to escape, and he goes and hides under this bridge where these harmful spirits live,

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.720
 and so he wasn't particularly religious or had no really faith in the Three Jewels,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.560
 but then these, you know, night was falling, and he was hiding under there, and these beings came

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.200
 back, and they said, "Oh, look at this one," you know, easy praying, you know, lunch, or whatever,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:06.400
 they're going towards him, and he realized, "Oh, no, I'm done for it," but then he thought,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.440
 and he heard all the people taking refuge in the Three Jewels in the town, and he had heard that,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.960
 and he just, out of his panic and terror, he said, "I take refuge in the Three Jewels, I take

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.360
 refuge

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.280
 in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dharma, refuge in the Sangha," over and over, and the second

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.440
 they

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.640
 heard that, all those malevolent beings, they screamed, they said, "Oh, no, this one's under

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.000
 the protection of the Three Jewels. We have no power," and they just ran and turned because the

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.160
 power of the Three Jewels of protecting, like you said, the word darling, but anyway, so you're

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.960
 protected, you know, when you really take refuge, even if you die, you're protected because you

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.280
 have,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.360
 you know, you just have the vast view, you know. And that, too, kind of that point, like how you

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:55.440
 mentioned when we take refuge, like when we take the formal, make that connection with the lineage,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.040
 and we have that, but then how taking refuge is the gateway to all Buddhist practice,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:09.040
 and no matter what we're doing, we always start every session taking refuge, and like that point,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.280
 even if it's just like a simple line, but you know, first I always say, you know, the Four

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.160
 Thoughts, you know, thinking of that, but then always thinking of all these qualities of our

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.920
 situation, like the Four Thoughts that turn the mind toward the Dharma, or the Buddha Dharma Sangha

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.240
,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:31.440
 you know, and then how taking refuge is not only in our life begins this beautiful path, but every

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:40.080
 session, every day, you know, how that, it's like, you know, it's that doorway that opens up for

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.320
 our

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.600
 session and our practice, and like opens and softens our heart and mind, and reminds us of our

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.240
 joy and devotion and courage and commitment, and you know, our inspiration and what our,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.160
 you know, kind of redirecting, correcting our goal, and then beginning our practice with that,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.720
 and then with the Bodhichitta, and then the particular practice, but kind of the way,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.680
 like that whole, even if it's like just a few lines, it's still, we're not just saying those

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:17.360
 words, but really connecting with that beautiful meaning that's so lush and full, and then kind of

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:27.040
 the way that just really, also I just thought to mention, we're getting kind of, maybe just have

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.360
 about five or ten more minutes, so maybe we just kind of go over the next section of the chapter,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.840
 and asking you, should I, our points don't necessarily cover the whole chapter, should I just

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:50.000
 go through the basic points? Okay, so the next section we're going through, Rinpoche is talking

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.920
 more on the inner meaning of what it is to take refuge, and how that the inner level is of taking

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:06.480
 refuge is more connecting and relating to our own mind, and how the Buddha is the primordial

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:13.760
 nature itself, one's own pure awareness, you know, the absolute Buddha, it's always there from

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:22.160
 beginningless time, our very, you know, nature, primordial nature, and how the Dharma is what

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.000
 happens, you know, when we connect to that nature, and maintain all the qualities of our mind's

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.680
 primordial nature, and radiate that, and breathe that with all beings, and then went over some of

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:46.320
 the word meanings of Dharma, and the inner meaning of Sangha, and then went over again looking at

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:54.080
 one word meaning of inseparable, and looking at the inseparable clarity and emptiness of the mind,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.600
 and how that's connected with skillful means and wisdom that's always present

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:08.960
 with everything that's arising and of the nature, and that having that faith and closeness to the

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:16.480
 true nature, and then they continue just kind of going over who takes refuge, and how anyone with

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.600
 joyful interest and devotion to the three jewels can go for refuge, and how long do we take refuge

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.560
 until we actualize our Buddhahood, at which point we become an object of refuge, and then they

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:37.680
 conclude the chapter with kind of the ceremony of the tradition and the lineage by which we

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.480
 actually

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.480
 affirm and connect with the living lineage of Buddha Shakyamuni, the Dharma, and the Sangha,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.720
 and go over some of the main points of the actual refuge ceremony, and kind of stress the

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.280
 importance

00:27:51.280 --> 00:28:01.040
 how bodhichitta is a really essential element of that, kind of the main points for the rest of the

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:11.600
 chapter. Maybe I'll just read the second point. The three refuges also have an inner meaning

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:18.080
 related to the mind. The mind's primordial nature is totally pure, clear, and enlightened from

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:25.040
 beginningless time. One's own pure awareness is the primordial Buddha. Buddha actually means the

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.800
 perfect understanding that is free from all deluded and dualistic thinking. This is the absolute

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.200
 Buddha.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.360
 Maintaining the qualities of the primordial nature and radiating them to all sentient beings

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.120
 is the inner meaning of taking refuge in the absolute Dharma. The inner Sangha is also

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.280
 contained within the mind. This refers to the inseparability of clarity and emptiness as the

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.440
 true nature of the mind. Clarity and emptiness are always present, and that is the meaning of the

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:06.960
 absolute Sangha. It's interesting, this is like all these descriptions of nature of mind,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:17.520
 saying that is the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Particularly with all these different levels

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:17.520
,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:25.920
 are they more accessed based on the depth of our practice, or is it more about the way that we're,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.360
 like if we're looking at like a Vajrayana versus, maybe not so much versus, but like in contrast to

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.760
 like a more Mahayana view, is that where it comes into play more and how the teachings approach it,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.360
 or does it really have to do with, you know, the outer is the most obvious, that's where your

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.040
 practice is going to make it obvious, then from there the inner becomes more obvious, then like

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:54.400
 the secret. How is it that they relate to each other in that way? I think it's definitely a

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:54.800
 spectrum

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:00.240
 of subtlety. So if our mind is really tense and holding really tightly, then all we have available

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.600
 is what's very obvious, because our mind is being held so tightly, and as a grasping, even if it's

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.680
 for a minute, or for longer, as the grasping lessens, then more inner, more subtle workings

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.440
 of causation, of how our mind is working become more apparent to our mind, and become more

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.040
 interesting to our mind, to actually pay attention to those things as well. But definitely a

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.760
 spectrum

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.210
 of subtlety. I know in this, um, illuminating the path, this is the outer refuge is the three

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.480
 jewels,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.560
 and then they divide into inner refuge, secret refuge, ultimate refuge. So there's an inner

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:46.160
 refuge is the three roots. Secret refuge is the inner, like how the element or silo, how the inner

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:52.320
 structures of our body went in terms of more subtle levels of our body structure, how we use those

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:52.880
 to

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.600
 recognize our primordial nature. And then the ultimate level is the, our primordial nature,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.600
 not relying on any support, but like effortlessly accessing how our mind is when it's balanced

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:12.000
 without any grasping. It's definitely a function of how much grasping is happening in our mind,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.560
 or if there is no grasping, with what becomes what degree of refuge makes sense to us in that time.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.040
 And so it sounds like from what you're saying, in this second point, that the inner meaning

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.200
 rapiches are really emphasizing, at least in this book, is the, like that innermost, like the

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.440
 ultimate ultimate. And they're talking about the, the Buddha being our pure awareness itself,

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:47.680
 the dharma being the natural qualities that are just radiating, um, and then that the sangha,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:54.880
 the absolute sangha is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness. Which I thought it was

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.800
 nice that you included that here on the, kind of under these concepts and terms on this sheet,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:08.080
 because for me it was helpful just to read that the sangha, the absolute sangha is defined as the

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:14.080
 all-pervading, all-encompassing quality of the mind. Sometimes, yeah, anyway I just thought that,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.240
 that helps sort of fill out that definition of what is the absolute sangha.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:26.560
 And so that space, that description, comes from the Sangha Sridhariviches,

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.000
 like condensed explanation of the relative and absolute levels of taking refuge, which isn't

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.680
 from illuminating the path. And then as to the inner and secret, it's really interesting because

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:46.320
 here in this Buddhist path, the most outer and most inner, and then it's good that we know what's

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.920
 in between too, because if we think we can go from the most outer to the most inner, and that's all

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:51.920
,

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.600
 usually it's a little bit of a develop, developing, have to become more subtle.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:05.360
 It's hard to go from dense grasping to no grasping as a path, so it's interesting that point.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.200
 These aren't things we do anyway, right? What do you mean? Well,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:24.240
 I don't know. Seems to me that it has to do with practice, and like you said,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:30.240
 mind is certain way, and practice, and then it gets more flexible, and the naughty's getting

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.960
 gnotted, and you, you know, you're purified, and then it gets, you know, I mean, it's not something

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:43.600
 you, I mean, the outer refuge, we go and we take it, right? We can do that. And all of a sudden,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:51.120
 things seem that they have to develop through us and conditions. So it is something we do. Oh,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:34:04.880
 absolutely with courage. And that seems kind of part of, like you said, there's these

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:13.120
 out the absolute level and the outer level, and then there's that path of, of realization to

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.520
 unfolding. But that, especially with that last part on how we take refuge in the Sangha on the

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.720
 absolute level as all appearances and their nature, all the emptiness and appearance,

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.840
 skillful means and wisdom in a way. I mean, to me, it seems like that really touches on how

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:38.080
 to the best of our ability, when we're really practicing and touching home,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:46.640
 that realizing we're working with our own mind, you know, no matter where we are, whatever our

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.880
 capacity is, or how that might fluctuate, or that we're always working with our own mind,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:03.920
 and that we trust in its absolute nature. And in that way, everything becomes a teaching.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.200
 I mean, if we're working with our experience with that type of right, engaging with it that way,

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.440
 like everyone we see becomes the Sangha because their support for our maintaining that

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.160
 understanding.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.240
 You know, it's everything really. That's pretty, that's amazing.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.560
 And I think that's also why this is chapter four, because chapter one is saying we need to calm the

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.240
 mind, taking the mind. Chapter two is how is our mind when it's all being conditioned by all of

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.180
 its grasping. Chapter three, how it's the nature of our mind when it's not grasping onto everything

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.520
.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.560
 And then chapter four, so when we recognize this difference, like a totally balanced mind,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.720
 it's effortless and available, balanced, versus this grasping mind that's always struggling,

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.320
 then what's the path? How do we go from where we are grasping to how we can be when we're not

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.440
 grasping? That really makes sense that this is, it is all the mind, and it's really beautiful.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.640
 I don't know which is a very thoroughly established that up to this point in the book, I think,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:15.680
 very clearly. And how could it be otherwise, you know, that it's one zone mind that recognizes this

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:15.680
,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.080
 this one zone mind that recognizes the outer three jewels of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:27.200
 One zone mind that recognizes the, you know, the inner three jewels, or the channels,

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.220
 winds and essence elements. One zone mind that works with the three Vajras states and the Vajrayana

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:32.320
,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:38.880
 and one zone mind that's the nature of one's own mind too. So it's like God said too, the subtlety

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.040
 of, you know, you can only be aware of what you're aware of, you know, so if you're not aware of

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.120
 the

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.400
 luminous nature of your mind, or you don't fully recognize the nature of your mind, then you work

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.400
 with your mind to become aware of that by following the path and taking refuge according to your

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:02.960
 capabilities until you will, you'll include all four or all those types of refuge in one moment,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.360
 because you'll be at that stage where you recognize that and you're aware of that.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.680
 But even, and I think we have to wrap it up pretty soon, but even just the title of the book,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:20.080
 I mean here it was changed to the Buddhist path, but what is the Buddhist path? It was the title

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:30.320
 of the Shakespeare, opening to our primordial nature. And the light of the three jewels.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:41.200
 Yeah, they came every time too, because everybody suggested the title. They said, "Oh no, Anne."

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:52.480
 That's more mudra. Oh, okay. So anyway, so let's call it the light of the three jewels.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.280
 So then it has continued to flow. This is what we're talking about.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:10.400
 Light of the three jewels, Buddha Dharma Sangha, opening us to our primordial nature.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:19.120
 The Buddhist path. The Buddhist path. We will dedicate the merit, and of course there's some

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:27.840
 so rich and this opens up infinite, you know, richness in our practice and study and reflection

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:43.680
 and meditation.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:09.680
 So,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:39.680
 so

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:55.680
 by this merit may all attain omniscience.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:04.760
 So, so by this merit may all attain omniscience. And so, so by this merit may all attain omnis

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.680
cience.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:12.680
 And so, so by this merit may all attain omniscience. And so, so by this merit may all attain omnis

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.520
cience.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.960
 And so, so by this merit may all attain omniscience. And so, so by this merit may all attain omnis

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.440
cience.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.950
 And so, so by this merit may all attain omniscience. And so, so by this merit may all attain omnis

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:23.440
cience.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:32.160
 At this very moment for the peoples and nations of the earth may not even the names, disease,

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.840
 famine, war, and suffering be heard, but rather may pure conduct, merit, wealth, and prosperity

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.400
 increase and may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise. The precious bodhicitta and

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:44.720
 those

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.160
 without it may it be generated and those who have it may it never diminish but always continue

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:56.080
 increasing. May the great tradition of kenpo, shangta, rakshida, lord nonpana, sambhava,

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.720
 and dharma king, tristan, detsan increase and spread throughout the three realm world.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.760
 May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind streams of beings remain inseparable and

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.440
 brings to long well-being throughout the three times. Theating mantra and dharma kaya are the

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.160
 nature of appearance, sound, and awareness. The pervasive kaya and wisdom display of the

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.920
 Buddhist. May practitioners of the profound and secret great perfection remain inseparable

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.880
 from the innermost one taste awareness of wisdom mind.
