NOTE     "synopsis": "Vajrayana Master & Nyingma Scholar\nVenerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\n\u201cEssential Dzogchen Teachings on the View, Meditation, and Conduct\u201d\nby the Great Master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nPBC Palden Sherab Pema Ling Retreat Center:\nLotus Land of Glorious Wisdom\n18190 131st Trail N\nJupiter, FL  33478\n\nEmpowerment of Guru Padmasambhava as Guru Vidyadhara \nRevealed by the Great Terton Tsasum Lingpa\n(Sunday Morning, January 15 - In Person Only at Pema Ling in Jupiter, Florida)\n\nGuru Padmasambhava gave a variety of teachings to benefit future generations. Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 I woke up from the bed and that moment started looking to the palm.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Palm. That is distractions. Really, distractions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.450
 It is because the moment you get up, actually in the teachings, the practicalness, you get up, "Oh,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.000
 this is new day. It's a birthday day."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.530
 "Name my days. How wonderful. I'm life and I'm going to practice. May my days become very beautiful

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.000
, beneficial and unconstructed in the loving-kind and complete."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.200
 It's going to benefit for all beings. Really reaching those things, feel the strong rhythms of the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
 Gaurabhama, some of the lineage monks and the Buddhists and their blessing, like,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 and coming and then just kind of feel those thoughts immediately is so important.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.260
 Otherwise kind of whole day we start looking to the telephone or the computer and the walking, this

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 and that. That is distractions.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 That is like Gossips. An ancient time was teaching Gossips kind of to the rudimentary group of us.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 Now the Gossips are carried by the electronic. And then we completely distract with the whole Goss

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.000
ips.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And not just distract. We need to distract with all different emotions. All different emotions.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Something that we cannot end up in. We cannot stop anything. Yet it is disturbed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So many things. Those are known as Buddha's teachings, demos, demons, really that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So now with that, with all those things, and during the meditation, then meditate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.330
 At least for a period of time trying to not distract it by mind all different levels, different

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.000
 ways.
