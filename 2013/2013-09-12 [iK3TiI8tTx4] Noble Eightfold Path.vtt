00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 "Coordination, total length of the interdependent coordination is the samsara, how it continues.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.880
 And the center-dependent coordination, the total interdependent coordination, I told yesterday to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.420
 you,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.360
 can be summarized, can understand it within the contracts of the first true, noble truth,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.120
 suffering noble truth and cause of suffering truth. And that is samsara.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.080
 This is also an elaborate way, the gracious teacher Buddha explained as 12 interdependent

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.800
 coordinate links.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.400
 I will have to reverse that. I will have to stop that chain, continue with the spiral.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.440
 Then we have to follow the path. And that is known as path truth. Path truth.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.510
 Path truth will bring the cessation truth, which is also known as the enlightenment series in Mahay

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.960
ana.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.000
 Absolute enlightenment that will bring by following the path.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 In the path, again, as the gracious teacher Buddha said, "O monks, there is the Eightfold Noble

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.560
 Path

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.850
 to reverse the cause of suffering and suffering truth. There is the Eightfold Noble Paths that you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.760
 can follow."

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 So this Eightfold Noble Path is explained here. According again, these Eightfold Noble Paths,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 seven instrumentals of the enlightenment is not something that only we practice on the first bhumi

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:47.440
 and the rest of the paths. But it is started day one with practices.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.240
 When you reach according, when you reach to the second bhumi on the meditation path,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 when you begin the meditation path in the teaching set, that time the Eightfold Noble Path becomes

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.080
 so beautiful, so strong, so perfect. That time it becomes perfect.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 And before that, we want to be perfect because due to the dualities and as well as obscurations

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.120
 and our habit patterns, we are kind of most jiggly, jiggly. But still, we put that joyful effort,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.240
 courage, tormentment, all the tools that the Buddha taught and the great master lay out,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.720
 and we put that. It will make us always joyful, always happy, peaceful. It's not something

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.120
 struggling, but it is part of joy, part of peace, part of excitement and adventures.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.360
 It is upon us, it is beautiful, it is a move forward. But however, again, when we reach

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 to the what this is called, with this beautiful motivation, with that quality, we move forward

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.760
 continually and then we reach past bhumi. Past bhumi time, as I said in the great master's,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.640
 Nagarjuna in everyone's day, that time the seven instrumentals of the books of the enlightenment

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.400
 will become so strong, so perfect. That means perfect. That time will become perfect.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.840
 And now, we have that perfect of the seven instrumentals, mentors so beautifully,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.840
 and then we continually apply and then reach to the second bhumi.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.240
 Twenty second bhumi we reach, and that time, now we begin to shine the earth, noble power,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.560
 so beautifully, so perfectly. That time. It is already started. They want new practices,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.600
 but this time become seen as perfect. So that's the general overview of this practice of the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.120
 earth, noble power. And now, we go to the earth, noble power itself, as great master said,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.400
 and as the Muharramuddhi's teachings. Great master Nagarjuna said, as well as great master

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.160
 Muharramuddhi's things. So first is, again, this nabhupadam is already in the text,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.440
 in the original text, but however, again, our talk is. So first is according here, what is listed,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.840
 according here, the great master Nagarjuna listed, perfect, positive, perfect. Second,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.160
 again, this perfect, perfect, we're going to apply to everyone, everyone, so perfect.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.080
 Second, it's perfect, livelihood. Third is, or again, we put that in that way.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:51.040
 Perfect view, perfect livelihood, perfect effort, perfect mindfulness, and perfect concentration,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.560
 perfect action, and perfect understanding. These edges are known as the perfect

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:13.040
 perfect, perfect of the path of nobleman, nobleman. You can add this path of nobleman to everyone.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:24.320
 For example, perfect will is the path of nobleman. Perfect living who is path of nobleman.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:33.760
 Perfect effort, your effort is path of nobleman, and so on, and that, and that's known as the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:46.560
 perfect nobleman. And now with this, first is will, the perfect will. Will is as

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:56.080
 a great and thinking particular said many times, and I said, and you know now, perfect will

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.520
 is so important for us or for practitioners. Will is that what we're going to capture.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.680
 The will is that what we're going to realize it. When we talk about the realization,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.840
 it's talking about will. That is what it is. Realization, when we talk about realization,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:26.320
 is will. So therefore, will is so important. Will is like I, looking to our directions,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.800
 looking to the behind, looking to the around, so that we will be continually stay in the clear,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.520
 brilliant light, so not darkness, kind of carried away and become the obstacles. We have the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.920
 perfect

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.480
 will. It will be more brightly brilliant as great master Nairajuna said in this teaching,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:55.680
 we will move from light to light. It is moving of the light. Now, what is will? Will can be,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.400
 and I mean it's so beautiful things, so many things, beautiful things, but every summarize

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.680
 all wills, it can be will in truth. This is known as the will of the vast understanding or the will

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.320
 of the understander of the vastness of the relative truth, will of the understander of the profound

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:22.000
 of the absolute truth. This can be summarized all. So that means these two wills. Two wills.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.360
 And this time, what is for our practical to understand of the will? It is the teaching,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.560
 the practice that you're doing that have to understand. Bring that will clearly as it is.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.080
 It is a simple way to tell the path. We have to know the path. We have to know the bermis and what

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.040
 our path, what our bermis, the end of all the teachings, what we went through. I mean, it's

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.560
 all is related to the most relative truths, but they're so important to understand because it

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:05.200
 will make us so pure, so simple, so beautiful, so perfect, perfect. Without that, we won't really

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.160
 develop in a way to go discover our beautiful nature. Habitat pattern is continuing. The grasping

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.360
 is continuing. Even we have the perfect beautiful will of the understander of the relative truth,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.720
 the teaching of the Buddha. But still there is so many, this highness, as I said, this six of five,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:32.400
 those obscurations that who will robs our virtues that great master said. There is, therefore,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.040
 vigilantly, joyfully keeping the will. That is that. To make a more detailed way to understanding

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.960
 will is possible. Will is a relative truth to understand beautifully. And then along with that

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:52.480
 contrast in externally, such as know that what is 10 virtues, what is non-unvirtues. I mean,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.640
 understand all those things beautifully, exactly as it is, knowing known as the vastness of

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.200
 knowledge

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.240
 of the relative truths. Once you have that understanding, then explore the will, will

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.800
 of the absolute truths as we all learned from the jockey teachings of Mahamudra teachings,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:20.560
 Madhima teachings. That is the will. That is will. Understand, exactly that realization.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.560
 Breathe up again, applying with the relative truth instructions. All that shouldn't forget.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.680
 Instructions are needed. Needed because we are struggling. We are here, we live

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.360
 burdened and sorrowed by the habit patterns. Habit patterns is not just beginning these

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:44.400
 life times, but in the biggest time, we carry the habit patterns one after another. And this time,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.120
 this life, we added so many things also. Plus, so many habit patterns, our own habit patterns,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.200
 traditional habit patterns, believe in the different things, this and that habit patterns

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.960
 is really all noted. And therefore, to keep up that all the instructions perfectly and release

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:09.280
 and liberated that, bring up the some light, the brilliant sky will of the absolute truth

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.880
 in our heart and mind, merge that realization as it merge, as it appears externally and as

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 your nature is that. As the jockey teaching said, that is the will. Now will is firm. When you have

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.320
 the perfect solid beautiful unheavened will, the practice moves so beautifully, practice moves so

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.480
 nice. We're not going to jiggling here, hesitating in a doubt and hesitate and trembling all the

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.120
 time

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.710
 and kind of shaped by by the sermon and discursive port, this and that, that might be, this might

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.880
 be,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:54.400
 this is, then I'm all disturbing. We have, this is what we have to have the beautiful rules. Once

00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.880
 we have that beautiful will, and then what will be conduct level, what we're going to do? And then

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.680
 he and the teaching said, part of the livelihoods, part of the livelihood is there as in the

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.000
 teaching

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.040
 said, and you you hear it said, in the food level, there's a variety of things we can understand,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.360
 all the different things, but in the food level, we take the food as medicines, medicines, and we

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:28.080
 should not also have food that is kind of, you know, all the negative bits, loudness, and many of

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.240
 your

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.720
 you are vegetarians, which is wonderful, really beautiful. Vegetarian is beautiful, terrible care,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.840
 and livelihood that's not harming to anyone. Anyone is something that clean, pure, and then also

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.320
 use with us medicines and exactly that. I have kind of more loudness and what Buddha taught,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:56.400
 Buddha taught, not to extreme, not to loudness, and kind of simple, beautiful, but joy and peace

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:05.040
 and happiness, and rewarding to ourselves that always rewarding us joy, peace, happy, satisfaction,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.260
 and we have that, we are staying beautiful lives, that is beautiful lives, peaceful life, happy

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:14.720
 lives,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:26.000
 that is what it is. So that is really about the, oh sorry, really about the livelihoods,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:33.280
 and the next one is the effort. Effort is then same thing as in the six parameters.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:43.280
 What is joyful effort? Joyful effort is vital and essential to fulfill our goals,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:52.320
 goal of the practice, goal of realizations, great goals, and not disturbed by laziness.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:13:00.480
 Laziness, laziness is opposite, laziness is distract us, laziness pull down, laziness

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.160
 can come many different ways, sometimes very naive ways, sometimes can come very kind of

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.840
 appealing, sometimes can come instrumentally kind of instructing somebody, looks like kind of,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.160
 and it's all different ways come. It's display of the conception, discursive thoughts, bring up the

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:25.520
 joyful effort, keep the wheels strongly to the close to your heart, heart and carry on, move on,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.920
 that is, and then we mentioned many times and you know already joyful effort already, and to keep

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.160
 the

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.640
 instructions perfectly beautiful as Buddha told in this teaching said many times, what is the

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:46.160
 mindfulness? Mindfulness is so important. Mindfulness is intelligence, mindfulness is thoughtful,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:54.400
 mindful, breathing, alertness, so in remembering instructions, remember the beliefs, not let that

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.200
 goal, doubt, doubt by the holy thought and as well as habit patterns and discursive

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.000
 busyness, stressful, stressful, anxiety kind of carried away there and they dimmed our mindfulness

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.920
 and we lost the identity of our practices. If that happened then obstacle, that's called obstacle,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.360
 it's nothing than this, that is obstacles. Obstacles can come many different ways,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:28.800
 preventing that, this, so therefore again keep up the mindfulness. That's one is concentration,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.960
 that means again we were going through trials in this teaching already and you know meditating,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.400
 samadhi, all the sudden meditation, there's two things, is vipassana and shamatha. What are you

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.400
 going to meditate with? You're going to meditate with vu that you learned, particularly absolute

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:57.520
 truth, absolute truth of vu, zokin vu, mahamudra vu, the mademaka vu, that is you're going to kill.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:07.280
 Who is going to kill this vu? Our mind, vu is not object, vu is our mind. Discovering that

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:16.720
 knowledge, that wisdom, that affinity, that openness of our own nature as it is, that is known as

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:26.480
 the vu and that maintained by then. That's samadhi, all maintained by the shamatha,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.760
 maintained by the vipassana, all in the dokchi teaching always the great master said

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:43.840
 and he is using of the vipassana to meditate, inseparable, so keep that. How are we going to

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.680
 keep that? With joy, with joy for effort, with mindfulness. Mindfulness, all those visual

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.320
 ingredients

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.560
 blend in, it's not just they are different locations and different tools that bring all

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:06.400
 in one packet, one status, fuse that up. That's how we glorify, we meditate for, beautify

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:17.200
 our life and our spiritual practices. And then next one is activities, perfect activities.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:24.480
 Activity is then again in this teaching, we said many times, activities that do the perfect

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:31.760
 activities, that do the perfect activities of the ten virtues. If we simplify ten virtues,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:41.120
 it's perfect activities. If we do unten virtues or the non-ten virtues, that is not perfect

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.240
 activities.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.380
 So therefore again, the greatest teacher, Buddha and the great master Nagarjuna, everyone

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:48.960
 highlighted

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.760
 that, made so beautiful manual, beautiful road signs, like this, what is, what is, so we don't

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:04.390
 have to stay in the dark of this mind, what could be this, so clearly collected. Ten virtues is

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.880
 then,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.720
 we listed in this, ten other virtues also listed, we went through those in this teaching and you

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:10.960
 know

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:20.160
