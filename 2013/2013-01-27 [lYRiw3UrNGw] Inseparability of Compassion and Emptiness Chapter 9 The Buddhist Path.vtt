00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hello, welcome to the ninth webcast of the Morning Dawn Study Group from Padmasamyaling.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 So here we're talking about the ninth chapter of the Venerable Kemperimache's book "The Buddhist

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.000
 Path"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 and the chapter's entitled "The Inseparability of Compassion and Emptiness."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.670
 So we'll begin with the opening prayers and then we'll go into our discussion. Thanks for joining

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.000
 us.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 [Music]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 We pray to the honor of the Lord, Guru, glorious, her teacher, precious one,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 dwelling on the lowest seat on the crown of my head, hold me with your great kindness,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 [Music]

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So this ninth chapter of the Venerable Kemperimache's book "The Buddhist Path"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 begins on page 45 and I'll quickly give a little overview for this first main topic point of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.000
 discussion.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 So here Kemperimache's begin the first paragraph saying that compassion is the sincere feeling

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 of wanting to help remove other's suffering when you see them in pain,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 and that there are three types of compassion.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 The first is compassion that focuses on sentient beings.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 The second is compassion that focuses on ignorance.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And the third is compassion without any focus at all.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And they go on to say that the first type of compassion is when we see others experiencing pain

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 and we want to help them not be in pain.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And then the second type of compassion is a compassion that focuses on the root cause of suffering,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 which is ignorance. We don't see that everything on all levels is constantly changing.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And so we hold on to things as if they'll last forever.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And we have compassion for everyone who makes this mistake and therefore suffers.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And this third type of compassion, compassion without any focus,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 is all-inclusive compassion that doesn't make any distinctions between objects.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 It includes them all.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 So this is the deepest level of compassion in the absolute state of equanimity.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 By recognizing the absolute true nature, we are free from all the limitations of concepts,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 judgments and preferences, and compassion naturally arises beyond all desire and duality.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 So then we'll go to the first topic point.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 This is on page 45, the second in the fourth paragraph.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Compassion can be divided into three types.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 The first is compassion that focuses on sentient beings.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 The second is compassion that focuses on ignorance.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And the third is compassion without any focus.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 The first type of compassion is easy to understand.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 If we look closely at the painful situations that sentient beings experience,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 we feel compassion and want to change their miserable conditions.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 The second kind of compassion is directed toward a deeper level.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It is compassion for the ignorance that sentient beings have about the true nature of phenomena.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Everything about their bodies, possessions and emotions is constantly changing.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 But due to ignorance, sentient beings grasp and cling to their lives as if they will last for eons.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Then, when things change, they suffer.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 This type of compassion focuses on ignorance as the root of all suffering.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 The third type of compassion is objectless compassion.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 The first two types of compassion have objects.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 The first has the suffering of sentient beings and the second has their ignorance.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 But the third type has no particular focus.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 It is the deepest level of compassion.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 It is the meditation on the absolute state of equanimity.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 I remember particularly when first looking at this material,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 it didn't seem immediately apparent how it was connected.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 On an intellectual level, it's absolutely beautifully laid out in here.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 It seemed almost like needing a bit of a jump or something.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 It didn't quite seem as apparent, almost like on a personal level at first.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 It didn't quite have that "obviously" kind of thing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 I was curious, particularly in the different types of compassion

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 and how that relates to the recognition and the understanding of emptiness.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 On a personal level, on a practice level,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 where did people come to find that level of recognition of it,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 that familiarity with this inseparability?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 What do you think of it?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Which inseparability?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Well, the inseparability of the compassion they empty.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 How they are really, they emanate together, co-arise.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 So you're asking more about that third type then?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 The third type of compassion?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Particularly when you're looking at those first two levels of compassion,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 it's hard to think, "Okay, I'm not sure how..."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Because you look at the title of the chapter,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 "Inseparability of Compassion and Emptiness",

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 and you're looking through the first two types of compassion here.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 It's not quite sure.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 How is it that this type of compassion is that inseparable?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 On the third level, it's a little bit easier when you're resting

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 in the nature of the mind with that recognition.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 It's easier to see there, but it's still in the first two.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 I was curious particularly, for people,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 how is it that they, as they practice or just in their life,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 where is it they found that familiarity, that understanding,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 where it became a little bit less about the terms

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 and more about, "Oh, yeah, this is true.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 I feel this. I understand this. This is natural to me."

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 I think the first two are easier to understand than the third.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Oh, good.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 You're in the temple somehow.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Yeah, it seems to me, in a way, that the first type of compassion

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 is maybe just more general, more outer.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 You really are seeing someone who's suffering

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 and that feeling of compassion to which to alleviate that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 It's more of an outer level, more gross or apparent situation.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Then the second type that's focusing more on the ignorance,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 they say, "This type of compassion is focusing on the root of the suffering."

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 It's not just the suffering and wanting, for instance,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 someone's sick and wanting to make them feel comfortable, which is good.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 But wanting to really get to the root of why are they suffering, truly.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 In a way, that's a little more, less outer, a little more inner.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Then that third type is even more...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 In one way, it's really saying objectless.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 It's totally open and freely expressed and just no boundaries.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 In another way, it's almost like it's the most pervasive.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It includes the outer and the inner.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 In a way, it's almost like, "Oh, it's more obvious because it's so pervasive."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 But it's more subtle, it's more the most, maybe the most inner.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Most of the source.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 I had an answer from my own practice about the thoughts on the three types of compassion.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 I started out and I didn't really connect that much with the Four Noble Truths.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 They didn't seem very profound to me.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Then I started doing a little more attempts at the compassion.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 That was the first type of compassion.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 But then I was wondering, if I'm trying to have compassion,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 or if I think that all beings are suffering and I need to have compassion for them,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 for what is causing their suffering.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 So then it leads into understanding how we see things

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 and then when we see that when we really understand what causes the suffering,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 then we could more easily see that it is not the way that things are

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 or our perceptions that are causing suffering are not the way things actually are.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 So then that could lead to emptiness.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 And that's part of what like Rinpoche say, I think, in that next paragraph.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 I don't think it was in the, yes, not in the study, but it's just right on that next page, page 46.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 This third type of compassion is achieved gradually.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So it's not as easy to understand, so it's just not as apparent.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 But it's something that we, I think, like you're saying, as we go along the path,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 we kind of get glimpses of it and it starts to make more sense that it's that way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And it seems like the bridge is really, in a way, that second point.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 When I think about it, think about what ignorance, there's ignorance.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Like Rinpoche's are bringing out how there's a sense that everything is solidly existing

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 and it's going to last forever.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And then that's just not the nature of it, even on the relative level.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So there's that kind of disappointment and then different kinds of suffering attached with that.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.630
 But then on the deeper level, I mean, so there's ignorance of how things really are on that

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.000
 relative level

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 or that they're not permanent, they're always changing and there's nothing substantial to find.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.050
 And that non-insubstantial aspect or ignorance of emptiness really is also, I mean, they go

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.000
 together.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 There's that basic misunderstanding of how things are.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Like on absolute level too, maybe that's more breaking it into absolute and relative.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 So as we become more familiar just with how things are, how, you know,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 how, you know, relatively speaking, absolutely, on absolute level or whatever,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 and then of course there's the union, then it seems like that third type of compassion

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 maybe comes more and more natural because it seems like this is all so profound.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 It's so much really the whole practice, like the Buddha nature itself

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 or like the primordial nature is this compassion without limit and without bound, you know.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And it seems like that's a lot of what this third type of compassion is

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 as we become more and more familiar just with the world and how it's, what's going on, you know.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And then as well as this deeper, the essence of all the things of our own mind in the world,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 then maybe this third compassion becomes more and more natural.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.870
 And then likewise, I couldn't just say later in the book, all of this becomes more and more natural

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.000
, you know.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 But especially because maybe we ourselves are hopefully, you know,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 becoming more and more familiar with the nature as it is and not so shocked.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So if I hear it correctly, just hearing from what everyone's saying here is, you know,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 even if it's not obvious at first, you know, with that investigation and with that familiarization,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.380
 it seems like a lot of, pretty much what the three of you are saying, you know, with that

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.000
 investigation,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 you see how it is they really are inseparable.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 I mean, I think one good analogy is like the dream analogy,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 which is used so often to describe what is enlightenment.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 It means like awake, awakened one, you know. So awakened from what, you know.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 We say the slumber of ignorance, that's what a classic metaphor.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 But if you think of it as not recognizing that,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 taking everything to be real and true and yourself and everything else,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 it leads to all kinds of troubles. I mean, this, we all kind of know.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 But imagine if we're in the nightmare and then we wake up,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 totally awake from the nightmare, like the Buddha.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.300
 And then you look around and you see everyone's sleeping and everyone's having a nightmare, you

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.000
 know.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 It's like you see there is no nightmare, there is no real nightmare.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 But you look around and you see that everyone thinks there is a real nightmare,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 which is like, I mean, just on a gross level, you know,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 having that experience of recognizing, say, that nature is like waking up.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.270
 And then, but yet you see that other people aren't awake and so there's all this trouble and

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.000
 difficulty.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 So in that sense, then naturally, I mean, of course, when you see that and you look around,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 you're like, oh, this isn't a nightmare, this is actually a wonderful dream, you know.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 But everyone thinks it's a nightmare. Then naturally, you would think,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 well, there are no real sentient beings because it's all a dream.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 But they think that they are real and that it's a nightmare.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 So that's kind of a little bit of like the emptiness, recognizing the nature

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 and then recognizing other people who don't recognize in that nature, you know.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Of course, you have compassion. I like the analogy of a dream because it's so, you know,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 we can all relate to waking up from a dream and realizing, oh, that was a dream, you know.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 And then realizing that whatever happened to the dream is like no big deal with them.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 What do you think, Karpa?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 I thought, I mean, to put this in a bit of a larger context of the Buddha's overall teachings,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 then I was thinking of it kind of in terms of the three turnings of the Wheel of Dharma,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 the three main topics that the Buddha taught on during his lifetime.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And so this first turning of the Wheel of Dharma, the first main topic,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 is this first two types of compassion are mainly within the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 So, as Ross said, talked about the Four Noble Truths.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Then this is a principle teaching of the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 There is suffering, it's cause. There's a way out of suffering

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 and the path to that final elimination or cessation of suffering.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 This first type of compassion is suffering. There is suffering.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 We obviously see suffering.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And then the second type of compassion is, well, what is the cause?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 What is the cause of that suffering? This is the second Noble Truth.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 So this is exceptionally profound.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 So here, these first two types of compassion and also the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 the Buddha is principally talking about how is a relative level

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 or how are the experiences experienced by a mind that's holding onto itself with a lot of grasping.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Very mistaken. So that's the whole first turning is a deluded mind.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 How does a deluded mind experience relative reality?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 We see suffering and then more subtly, we have to see its cause.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And that's a very, without seeing that, then we'll never achieve enlightenment

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 because we all see suffering everywhere.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.680
 But so, within these three turnings, this first two types of compassion fit within the first

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.000
 turning.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 And then this second type of compassion, this compassion without any focus

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 or without any limitation beyond sentient beings and non-sentient beings,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 beyond this and that, sorry, the third type of compassion.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 This is specifically in the second turning of the Wheel of Dharma.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And the main topic of the second turning of the Wheel of Dharma was emptiness

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 or you could say the absolute nature of experiences.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 So this is all the words called Prasanaparmita, Mother of all the Buddhas

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 or Madhyamaka, the middle way teachings.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 So this is going on in addition to the how deluded mind experiences relative reality.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Then also there's the nature of how, of experiencing that absolute truth of that same reality.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 And then here, Ramachas very quickly then go on to also include the third turning.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Because like they, in this next page, from page 46, they explain emptiness

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 not as just being empty, like an empty jar, like it's empty of something bad

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 but it's actually full of all these goodness qualities.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 So this third turning of the Wheel of Dharma is principally emphasizing

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 this Buddha nature that we all have, all sentient beings.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And so very quickly with these three divisions of compassion,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 they very succinctly contains all the three turnings of the Wheel of Dharma

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 of Buddha's teachings too.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 First, how grasping mind experiences reality is being troublesome.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Second, what is the cause of that? It's the grasping of the mind.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Third, what is the mind like when it's not grasping onto anything?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 It's full of love and compassion and wisdom.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And so I thought, that's what I was thinking. Ask me.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 [laughter]

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 I think that kind of leads into the second point.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Yeah.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 So I'll just give a somewhat quick summary of the rest of this chapter

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 which is actually three more pages of teaching by Ramachas.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 So immediately following this first topic point,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Ramachas say that practicing compassion will lead us to realize the absolute truth of emptiness

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 and recognizing emptiness will spontaneously cause our loving-kindness and compassion to grow.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And that relative and absolute truths are always naturally inseparable like fire in its heat.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 They always arise together.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And then in the seventh paragraph, they say,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 "Emptiness does not mean the absence of something like an empty house or an empty bottle.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Emptiness is fullness, openness, and flexibility

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 because there's nothing that solidly, substantially, permanently exists

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 then everything is flexible, dynamic, and interdependent.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.720
 And this is why all appearances and experiences are said to be like bubbles, reflections, or dreams

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.000
."

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 In the eighth paragraph, if we analyze outer objects,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 what initially seemed solid and unchanging, before we investigate it,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 is revealed to be made up of many types of parts

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 that are all further divisible into even smaller parts, infinitely.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 And there is no smallest part or no irreducible, indivisible material particle or ground of being.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 That is just a mistaken idea.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 If we look into the mind, and not just outer objects,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 we can't find the mind as a solidly existing thing either.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Where is the mind exactly? Where is that past thought? Where is that future thought?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Where is this present thought right now?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 On the ultimate level, the mind is also illusory and imaginary.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 It cannot be found if we look for it.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And then the tenth paragraph, understanding the two truths, the relative and absolute,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 is also practically beneficial.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Like, for example, when we get angry,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 if we look directly at our mind which feels angry,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 where is the solid anger, or the real person that's getting angry?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 By recognizing the emptiness of the negative emotion, it dissolves.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 The confusion it is based on is seen, and the negative emotion is released.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 On the relative level, when we're less angry,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 then we can apply the antidote of wisdom and love and compassion

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 by seeing that the object of our anger is suffering so much.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 That person is suffering so much, for example.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And that we wish that everyone be freed of their suffering,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 and thus be freed of the negative emotion that's causing that suffering.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And even more subtly, that ignorance that causes the negative emotion.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And then they go on to say that in the famous Heart Sutra teaching of the Buddha,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 the Buddha explained the union of appearances and emptiness

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 through the power of his meditation.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And this very famous teaching from this Heart Sutra we all know is,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Form is none other than emptiness, and emptiness is none other than form.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 So we might have heard this, but if we really knew it,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 then this would be easy for us, this part.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 So then everything we experience is freed from a fixed, inherent nature,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 and yet, things still clearly manifest and appear.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 There's nothing solid to hold onto, which is why things can appear in the first place.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 So why do we keep grasping onto things as being real and solid and fixed?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 It's because of our mistaken understanding.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 We need to release this grasping by realizing the emptiness of all of our experiences.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 In the 13th paragraph, you see the great meditation master and scholar Nagarjuna

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 said that on the absolute level, everything is emptiness.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And yet, on the relative level, things appear and function.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Since all appearances are empty, the relative and absolute are inseparably united,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 because things appear, and so they're still empty as they appear.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 What is empty always appears in some way,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 and all appearances are empty of a singular, independent, permanent nature.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Then in meditation practice, wishing that everyone attains enlightenment

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 and become free from suffering, while cultivating more love and compassion,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 these are the relative level practices.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And then meditating on the great emptiness is the absolute practice.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 And then by realizing the true nature of our mind and our experiences,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 our compassion and loving-kindness spontaneously grows.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 And then by practicing boundless compassion and love for others,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 we recognize the emptiness nature of everything more clearly.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 And then they at ribcage conclude by saying we should always practice

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 with an understanding that compassion and emptiness are inseparable.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 So that's the summary of the entire chapter.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And then maybe now we'll go, sorry for that long-winded thing,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 but that's the chapter.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 And now we'll go to the second topic point, if you would.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Okay, thanks.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 So this comes from page 46, the first and second full paragraphs.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Practicing compassion will bring about the recognition of emptiness

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 as the true nature of the mind.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 When you practice virtuous actions of love and compassion on the relative level,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 you spontaneously realize the profound nature of emptiness,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 which is the absolute level.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 In turn, if you focus your meditation practice on emptiness,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 then your loving-kindness and compassion will spontaneously grow.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 These two natures, the absolute and the relative, are not opposites.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 They always arise together.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 They have the same nature.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 They are inseparable, like a fire in its heat, or the sun in its light.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Compassion and emptiness are not like two sides of a coin.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Emptiness and compassion are not two separate elements joined together.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 They are always co-existent.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 I think that last point is really so good.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 I mean, I feel like I, because, you know, we have these two words,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 "emptiness" and "compassion," I mean, definitely my dualistic mind is like,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 there are two things, and I like to think of them like coming together

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 like two sides of a coin.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 And Rinpoche's are just so clear in this line.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 They are not like two sides of a coin.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 They are totally inseparable.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And, I mean, these metaphors are great, like fire and heat.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 You can't take the heat from the fire like they just arise together.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 It's really such a profound, so profound to contemplate pet.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 I think what always helped me is like, if you think about what is emptiness,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 is it a thing?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Like this lotus is like a thing that we designate as like a lotus.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 But is there a lotus here, and then there's emptiness here.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 So there's emptiness, and then there's a lotus which is not empty.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 You know, emptiness is not something that you can point to as like a designated in space and time.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Because the nature of all the objects is empty.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 That's why if you drop a glass, it shatters.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Or if it wasn't empty, when you drop it, well, it couldn't move.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 If you couldn't drop a glass, it wouldn't shatter.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 It would be an immutable, completely non-relational glass,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 suspended, completely separate from everything else.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 But so it's like in a certain sense, you could say compassion and emptiness.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Of course, they're two sides of the same coin.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Anything, anything, all relative truth, you know, that's what they're saying.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 It is emptiness.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 You know, it's not like there, again, I don't know, that always helped me.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 There's not emptiness on the left, and then completely solid substantial book on the right.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Because the book's nature is emptiness.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 So otherwise, it would be impossible.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And one of the other kind of aspects going off of what you're saying, too,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 is the fact that if you're continuing the metaphor of like a glass or something like that,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 you know, the reason that the glass was even able to exist is emptiness, you know, that it emerged.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 I mean, you know, of course, we don't exactly consider putting something through a factory emerging

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.000
.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 But, you know, it depends on your language.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.720
 You know, so that, you know, that other aspect of it, too, it does kind of bring this beautiful

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.000
 picture,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.980
 which I think kind of goes back to that really beautiful metaphor where you're seeing like that

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.000
 quality,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 you know, the quality of compassion, the quality of emptiness both, you know, in that metaphor of

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 like the fire and the heat.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 It's just these qualities that are just so beautiful.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.320
 You know, even if we can and often do, you know, discuss them separately, you know, it's still kind

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.000
 of the more,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.480
 the more you investigate them, you know, you start to see, oh, you know, who's making the

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.000
 distinction?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 What is making the distinction?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 I think it's kind of nice, too, just to like, you know, thinking about this in this first paragraph

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 here,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.300
 just talking about if you're practicing virtuous actions, this understanding of emptiness will

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.000
 naturally come,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 and vice versa, if you're practicing meditating and emptiness.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And why is that?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.230
 Well, I think, I mean, I was just going to touch on it just for a minute, just like on a really

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.000
 basic level,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 like if you just, like maybe just reflect on an experience of compassion that you've had, you know,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 where you've seen someone and felt compassion.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Like, to me, that feeling, just the feeling of it is expansive.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Like, it's this, like, it's an experience that opens you beyond yourself.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.080
 And so, like, in that experience is this, like, at least like a glimpse or at least like a bit of

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.000
 emptiness,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.090
 which emptiness being this openness, the flexibility, you know, the, like, what is the nature that

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.000
 it's not fixed.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 It's not solid.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 It's not just like me over here, you know, by myself.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 And, you know, there's this, it's something bigger.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And so, it's just kind of the experience touches that, I think.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:21.350
 It seems to me that when you do religious actions, you know, one obvious way is it's, your mind is

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.000
 more calm,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 your mind is more peaceful, you're more joyful, more at ease, more relaxed.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So there's not so much junk on the surface.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 So then, naturally, if you're thinking of other people, I guess, with a lot of compassion,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 the junk has like settled and, you know, I don't know.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 I mean, if we're talking too about the root, the root of suffering is ignorance,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:58.850
 which, what is ignorance, you know, we're not recognizing that we think that we are these solidly

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.000
 fixed individuals

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 and there's this outer world that's solid and fixed as well.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.790
 And, you know, so then when we, compassion is just like a gateway to see a little bit more and more

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.000
 and more as we practice

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and, you know, practicing these different types of compassion and opening more bigger, you know,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 it's just that it isn't so fixed.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And then, you know, eventually, hopefully we all realize that it's not fixed at all, you know.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 What would it mean to be not fixed at all?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 I think just like when they use these words like in the end of the paragraph here, like,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 it's immeasurable, like when you talk about like,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.490
 at a practical level in terms of our own practice, like, love and compassion immeasurably, like,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.000
 that's,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 like, so just there is no limit, there's no point at which it stops or like, you know,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 there's no like time or space boundary.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 So it just keeps going.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Yeah, even just recognizing that, you know, where's the fixation?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 You know, it's not because, you know, the nature already is.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 So it's, are we going to recognize it?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Are we going to give ourselves the space, you know, do that practice of compassion that actually,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 you know,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 pulls you out of a very specific view, you know, a specific way of perceiving

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 and kind of creating more space around, more openness, you know.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah, less limited.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Yeah.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 I think then, go ahead.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 I was just going to say, along those lines too, that like, that final goal or, you know,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 fully enlightened Buddhahood, that, I mean, the Buddhist teachings,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 all these beautiful teachings, we've said it before and Rinpoche has said it.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 That the Dharma is compassion itself and that all of the Buddhist teachings

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 are directly talking about that nature.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And if all of these beautiful practices aren't disassociated from the nature in any way,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 like each one of the Buddhist teachings, so beautiful and so complete,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 I'm not saying I like totally understand or anything, but just that aspect of the Buddhist,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 the Buddhist teachings are compassion and they're all to the point that, you know,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 it's kind of each a way to connect to the nature.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 So our experience now, no matter how deluded, it's still, there's ways to connect to,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 like, the fundamental nature that was never separate, you know,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 but of course we just don't, we're not familiar with, we're not natural

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 with just learning that whole part of the path of becoming more and more familiar,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 more and more natural and more and more expansive or inclusive,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 I mean, all these different words.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 It's just that small point, but just that part, how even, I guess that's my point,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.050
 that the Buddhist teachings, they're just in the same way that emptiness and compassion aren't

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.000
 separate.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 It's never, the path isn't a path is a path, it's never separate from compassion,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 it's never separate from, if we're applying it, you know, to the best of our abilities,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 applying the instructions, thinking about them, contemplating them,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 doing the practices to the best of our abilities, you know,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 then we're on the path and we're moving more and more toward that.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Even, of course, we're all sentient beings and we have limited vision,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 but still that part of the nature, it's accessible to everyone,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 even if it is just little glitters, but there's things in life that are so precious, you know,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 and that help, you know, to come, even just on that level of calming our body

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 and speech and mind and inspiring, like, some openness and understanding

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 and, you know, it's just always, it's always moving toward just being more and more full,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 fully familiar with the nature as it is, because that's my only point.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 It's never something else, we're not trying to make something up

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 or something that we're not, but just more and more natural.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 I mean, I have different things, but the one that was really related to what you're saying is that,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 that fundamental flaw of samsara existence is that we feel like there's this deep gut level fear

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 that if we don't hold onto something, we'll lose out, we'll lose something,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 it won't work, it'll fall apart, we have to hold and keep going for it to work.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 We have to hold on. It's that fundamental flaw of samsara.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 It's actually the cause of samsara is our holding.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And when we actually loosen up and get more flexible, what happens is we become more inclusive.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Our sphere of being sensitive to others, being sensitive to ourselves gets more flexible.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 We become more sensitive. We're not holding so tightly in a specific way.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 We're functioning in a much more varied, inclusive, complex, fully functional way.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 And again, just in an experiential level, that's called compassion.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 We see things more clearly, and we relate to them from the heart.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 So from our head or whatever, we can see more clearly.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And from our actual embodied experience, then we feel it as if it's us, as if it's ourselves.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.670
 Our inclusivity grows, our compassion grows. And why? Because we see more clearly, our wisdom grows

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.000
.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And so there's really said that in the Buddhist teachings, those two, wisdom and compassion,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 or you could say compassion and emptiness, that these are the two fundamental aspects of all of

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Buddhist teaching.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Wisdom and compassion. And another way to say that is relative truth and absolute truth.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 These are always together. They're always in union.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 And this is a fundamental paradox, too. Really. Because emptiness has two levels of emptiness.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 This isn't the second point, but it's separate, separate but involved.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 There's emptiness on the relative truth. We think that the thing is fixed. It's set.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 But it actually isn't set. It's totally dependent on all these things to appear the way it is.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 So this is called, it's not fixed. It's interdependent or dependently arisen.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 But that's just a superficial level, because that's still first-turning teaching.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Because we still think there's a thing there. And that's grasping.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Because there's a thing. There's a lotus there. And it has parts and the parts are real.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 But so then it goes, Buddha went, "Oh, so there's actually not a thing there either."

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 It's free from all conceptions, from all designations. And this is second-turning teaching.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Free from any way of designating it.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.540
 And that's why this paradox you get to in these middle-weight teachings that Kemper Rinpoche taught

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.000
 this past summer.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 And then Kemper Rinpoche is both taught in this Manyamaka book of theirs now.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 There are two truths this chapter covers. There can only be two truths.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 There's not three or more. There's not one or less. There's only two.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 But if you look at the two truths, this is interesting, something to think about.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 If you look at the two truths of relative and absolute truth,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 then they can't be the same.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Relative truth can't be the same thing as absolute truth.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Because if it was, anything we did on the relative level would lead us to enlightenment.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And it doesn't. Because I can harm people and that doesn't lead me to enlightenment.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 I can't eat an apple. That doesn't mean I'm enlightened.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 In another way, they can't be different either.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 Because if relative level didn't lead to enlightenment, if it was totally different,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 then there'd be no way to ever get enlightened.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 There'd be no way for enlightened beings to communicate on the relative level.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 So there's two truths, but they can't be the same and they can't be different.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 And there's two.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 So this is going to the second level of emptiness.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Emptiness is beyond conceptions.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 No conceptual model will actually fully make sense of the emptiness nature.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 It has to be realized.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 It has to be realized.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 You can't eat an apple with as much love and compassion and wisdom as eating that apple.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 I mean, I don't know. Maybe.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Some people do. The great bodhisattvas.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 We already have that wisdom.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 But then it's a good point to say that we can do it either way, depending on our style.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 If compassion comes more naturally, that will lead to become more inclusive

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 and to see things more clearly, emptiness nature.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 If emptiness or the absolute realization comes more easily for different people,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 then it should open our heart.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 And if the one doesn't lead to the other, then something's off in the practice.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 And that's the path, because something's constantly off.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 Otherwise we'd be on all the time. We'd be bodhisattvas.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 But so it's beautiful that it works either way.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Nature's so accommodating.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 And that works with individual people's own personality types too.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Like some people talk about, "Oh, I'm going to dance my way to enlightenment."

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Or, "I'm going to interact with people and do all these things."

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Embodiment, imminence, love people.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 And they really emphasize that aspect.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 And other people, "I'm going to sit still and not move for months."

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 "Get hell in a cave!"

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And those are, not that they're totally different,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 but it just doesn't mean that both can reach to the same goal.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 One might be more transcendent-oriented,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 but then the other one is more imminent embodied,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 and then ultimately they're inseparable, you know?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 You have that realization.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 But you're still embodied. You don't vanish into nothingness, space.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 There's something for everyone.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 The end is the beginning.
