00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 This is the beginning, and we are kind of going through all these so many kinds of things,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.080
 so many different teachings or different levels of the teachings that in the teachings said,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.360
 "All is the part of Dzogchen. All is the part of Dzogchen. Dzogchen is like every teaching.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.880
 Everything is within Dzogchen's state." As I said yesterday, the great master of post-Nechente,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.480
 how he put that in the Tibetan terminology.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.120
 Dzogchen is the Tibetan lord, and we make that letter longer.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.240
 Full sentence in Tibetan is called Dzokpachim. Dzokpachim. That's the Tibetan Dzokpachim.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.920
 Dzokpachim is what the great master of post-Nechente said, I think I said yesterday too,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.440
 that he said that entirely everything, both Samsara, Nirvana, and the part of the Nirvana,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 all are completed within one single state with Dharmadathu.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.160
 Dharmadathu. All is completed within one single Dharmadathu.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.640
 How that is completed? It's not just some, Dharmadathu is a big, jagged ball, and everything is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 included there.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.960
 Everything, whatever that is, in the Samsara, in the Nirvana, part of the Nirvana,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.720
 all are never separated from the Dharmadathu. All that.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.480
 And so that is what Dzokp, great complete, great complete status.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:44.760
 And pa, in Dzokpachim, pa means in the great master of post-Nechente, pa refers to rupa, rupa.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:53.400
 The awareness, one's own awareness. So that great Dharmadathu, where they're completed,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.600
 that Dharmadathu and rupas are inseparable.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.720
 Within the one single state of rupa, of the openness nature, everything is completed.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 And so that means rupa is intelligent, awareness wisdom, Dharmadathu is the emptiness aspect of the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.440
 nature,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.320
 and both are united, union states.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.200
 And then you say, chipu means what?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.960
 Chipu means when you have got that realization, there's nothing higher and better,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.000
 more important realization than that, and true discovery than that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.880
 Therefore, it's called chipu, dzokpachim.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.120
 So therefore, I mean, these are all teachings, everything is really in the Lord.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 In the Dzokpchim, or many times in the Tikhim mentioned, every teaching of the Buddhas.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.840
 From the day one, his teaching and all the Atiana's teachings are the passage to the Dzokchim.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.080
 They are the staircase to the Dzokchim, to the skull.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.480
 So all is within the Dzokchim state.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.240
 So therefore, here, in this great teaching of the Shirdi Durya number,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:19.360
 explaining of all this, all this math, everything is included.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.760
 Although there's more, more is explained here, and so now that's with that understanding.
