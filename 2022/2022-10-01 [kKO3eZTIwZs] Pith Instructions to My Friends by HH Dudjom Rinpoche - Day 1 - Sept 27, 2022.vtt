00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
 Again, thank you everyone. Good evening, good afternoon. Thank you everyone. Thank you very

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.200
 much for participating. Today, again, we are going to discuss the teaching of the gracious

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.880
 teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. To begin this, always in the teaching said that we should

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.120
 activate our beautiful motivations. Those are the teachings of the famous center known

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.080
 as "Jhudurje Tsimu". "Jhudurje Tsimu" mentioned the contents of all the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:41.720
 conceptions of all thought, thought and what I'm sorry, give up the contents, give

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.240
 up all the conceptions of thought and listen, reflecting the carefully the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.080
 teaching, and somehow we just disregarded and neglected that and even the Buddha

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.320
 Vaidyasattva will have difficulty to bless those who are

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.280
 destructive negligence. So that's really the teaching. So therefore

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.880
 always, whenever we are reflecting of the teaching by the studying, contemplating,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 meditating, and practicing, always activate the motivation. It is so important.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 Among the motivation, good motivation. What is good motivation? Joy, appreciation,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.640
 devotion, and the preciousness feelings, really feeling of the preciousness. Our

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.560
 life is precious, teaching is precious, lineage is precious, situation and time

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.080
 and circumstance are precious. All the precious things are gathered in our

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 sight for us. How wonderful, how beautiful, really, have the determination, courage,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.080
 and commitment, our values should activate the teaching, not just only the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.160
 reading and following that but going to practice. Observe that in heart, feel that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.920
 strongly heart, order to propose the benefit for all living beings. Helping

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 for all the beings, that attitude is so important. We have that attitude in the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.320
 teaching and say that every year have the good heart and good, good intention that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.300
 everything will turn into the good. And somehow if we don't have the good

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.640
 intention or neglect that even we're doing good practice, it's just not going

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 exactly on the right direction. So therefore, it is to activate it is so

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.280
 important to activate. And then teaching itself, in the Buddha teaching, there is

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.960
 two teachings known as the Buddha's teachings, the Scraptural teaching and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.520
 the commentary teachings. So these two, Scraptural teaching which is the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.960
 Grace of the Buddha Shakyamuni taught, taught from age 35 till age 82 or 81. All

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.040
 those teachings about Buddha, spoken teaching Buddha by Buddha, is known as

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.800
 Scraptural teachings. And then later on, great masters met the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.000
 commentaries, wrote commentary on the Buddha teaching. Those are known as

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.280
 the commentary teachings. Among those two teachings, what we are going to discuss

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.200
 today is commentary teaching in a way. And who wrote this teaching? It's a gracious

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.160
 and famous great master and a realizable being or realizable master known as his

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.680
 Holiness Dhunurumbuja, commonly and generally, regularly,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.080
 Japji Dhunurumbuja. He wrote this. He wrote so many commentaries and sadhana

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.760
 that connected with the teaching of the Grace of the Buddha Shakyamuni and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.240
 Gaurupahema Sambhava, over 25 volumes, volumes. Among that, just one of the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.760
 teachings that I picked up and thought represent to you all. At the same time,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.360
 remind to myself too, we all are followers of the Buddha, Gaurupahema Sambhava,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.120
 in His Holiness Dhunurumbuja or Japji Dhunurumbuja. They are reminding to each

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.600
 other to activate, resten our practice. Resten our practice is really very

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.840
 important. So that thought, I thought that among all the many greatest

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.800
 teachings, I picked up this one teaching and then made valuable to you by the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.160
 assistance of the, again, our Sangha members, Pete De Niro's and other Sangha

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.560
 members who really helped to put together and present to you that. So

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.760
 that's what the teaching is. And now, this teaching we started with here and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.800
 again, as you said, I'm adding also a few things because I'm going to go over this

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.660
 teaching according as much as I can, kind of go a little bit extensively that

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.000
 benefit, which will benefit to us, to all of us. So I'm going to do that. But

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.960
 at the same time, I thought maybe if I able to put that in this

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.340
 together, that will help you all to, all to understanding more, kind of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.520
 easily know that what I'm following that. So I put those addition things, which is

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.320
 also teaching of the Buddha and other great masters. And that is, again, we

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.680
 started with page 10 here, page 10, and that's the text. And here I said, "Pete

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.720
 instruction to my friend." That is his own dungeon, what he said. This is his

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.360
 friend. And particularly, he has so many disciples, so many disciples. Among that,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.720
 this teaching is requested by two individuals. He's named at the end of

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.840
 this colophon, colophon, which is known as Shuwen and Tsutrams, I think.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:10.440
 Two people. Two people insisted, "Please give some Pete instructions." So his

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.800
 owners gave these teachings to, specifically, to that person, but also it

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 to all of us, not just to this individual. Here is to my friend's instruction to my

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.120
 friend. My friend, of course, one way is just a very kind of person, two

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.280
 things. But according to the Vayayana teaching, in the Buddha teaching, all the

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.160
 sentient beings are our friends. All living beings are our friends. That is, go

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.680
 ahead and go back to Antara teaching. There is close friend, intimate friend,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.520
 close friend, and larger group friend, and all friends. So this is all friends. So in

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.800
 that way, intimate friend and very close friend, and as well as the larger group

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.440
 friend, and whole friend. So whoever, whoever like, interests to practices,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.720
 whoever like to follow the teaching of the Buddha, this is to everyone, not

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.240
 just to individuals. And so here, they have four, two friends, three friends,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.000
 all the friends. Then I put here, as a beginning, and generally, always in every

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.360
 teaching, say this, "To begin with this, to begin with this, it is extremely crucial

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.600
 for people in road with good fortune to the master of the corporate enemy mind,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.720
 reverse the continuum, again and again, with pure desire, obtain the

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.000
 precious state of the liberation and the omniscient, as well as relying on the

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.680
 light of the excellent dharma that gathered with teaching of the exalted

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.080
 speech of the Buddha, the king of the subdual, the vehicle, with the nine

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.040
 stages, and endowed with the three valid ways of not knowing that." So this is the

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.920
 summary of the teachings, kind of highlight of the subheadings of this. What

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.280
 I say, he is saying that, that, as I said earlier, we are all really fortunate

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.360
 person. Everyone is fortunate. We all practitioners are very fortunate. And to

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.600
 have every situation in a circumstances, conditions are on our side, and eating

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.280
 endowments, eating freedom, luxuries call it, really, we all have that. It is so

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.440
 wonderful, so special. And so that this special situation of circumstance is

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.680
 also not going to last forever, because well, everything is on our side, and with

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.840
 us, it is very important to use this opportunity to do practices, practices.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.240
 And why we need practices? That means we're going to reverse our samsara

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:01.440
 situation, samsara. To what? To the enlightenment status. What is our nature?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.400
 Always in the teachings, our nature is enlightened, Buddha-nature. Buddha-nature,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.200
 but if, even though it is Buddha-nature, this present time, this Buddha-nature is not

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:24.560
 fully wake up. Why? Due to the ignorance. We are deluded. When was deluded? And that

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.200
 is known as beginnerness, we are deluded. But even we are deluded, nature is never

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.680
 changed. It remained all the time same. Nature never changed. What means nature?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.220
 Buddha-nature never changed. We have that bright star in our heart as the Buddha-

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:50.280
 nature, never changed. But if we walk for this, we can really make the difference,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:59.440
 reveal our full Buddha-nature. How this Buddha-nature is deluded? How is it

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.480
 deluded as like dream-like in a teaching set? Dream-like. The dream is never

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.640
 kind of like created by the ordinary, it comes. It comes like suddenly due to the

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.880
 situation and circumstance and our kind of habit patterns as it arises.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.840
 Similarly, this habit pattern is produced by ignorance and then we are deluded. We

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.240
 are wandering in a samsara. And how long we are going to wander in a samsara? That

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:42.680
 is until we reversed our dissolution by the practice, by the meditation. And then

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.480
 when we reverse that, what? It will return back to our ordinary-nature state of the

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.800
 Buddha, Buddha-nature. Then we get enlightened. We become enlightened. So

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:00.220
 in order to do that, in order to reverse our our nature and in order to reverse our

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:06.960
 delusion and bring the full bloom-nature status, then we should do the practices.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.280
 For that reason, Buddha gave a variety of teachings, as in the teaching offering

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:19.480
 said, nine yana, different levels of teachings Buddha gives. Those are the

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.080
 names, I just would say names, of course many of you already know. Those are the

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:31.000
 first outer yanas, three yanas, which is known as kyarvaka yana and the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.560
 pati-buddha yana and bodhisattva yanas. Those are the outer three yanas, which is

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:47.080
 also known as causal yanas. And then three inner yanas, and those are karya. This is

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.920
 then started tantra teaching. And so those are three outer sutra teaching, and now

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.720
 three inner tantra started tantra teaching. And the outer tantra has

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:07.660
 kriya tantra, oba tantra, and yoga tantra. Those are three outer tantras. Three inner

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.720
 tantra or the cigarette tantra, which is then known as mahayoga, anayoga,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.200
 anayoga teaching. So all those teachings are known as nine yana teachings,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.440
 teachings. So now what we have, we all have the abundance of nine yana

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.600
 teachings according our readiness, we can practice it. And for that reason, he has

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.160
 said that we have all that weaker stages, situation and circumstances so

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.920
 perfectly, beautifully. And therefore, we should activate our practice in meditation

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.480
 with the beautiful intention and the beautiful thought, thought and the joyful

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.960
 effort. So that is the subheadings of this. Then I go to the next one. It starts

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.760
 with me here. That is now actually his dunjiramudya saying, "Aho, listen to my

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.560
 friends." That's it. "Aho" is the expressions in a Tibet. It sounds good word, but in the

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.920
 teachings, "Aho" means wonderful, amazing, awesome. It's kind of like awesome,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.760
 wonderful, amazing situation. Why? He said, "Because we have the precious lives. It's

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.080
 amazing. How awesome. Our teachings are available. How awesome.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:34.260
 Ladies and Master are also available. How awesome. And our readiness is also,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:40.040
 motivation is also really ready, kind of we are prepared. It's awesome. So all these

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.480
 awesomes, how wonderful. So that means how my friend or my friend who are ready to

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.400
 activate their Buddha nature and pursue that is really natural and to benefit

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.520
 for sentient beings, they are awesome. They are wonderful. They're beautiful. For

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:05.000
 those people, then listen. Listen is actually, listen. Listen is in the

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.120
 teaching said this, listen carefully. What the greatest teacher,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:16.680
 Buddha Shakyamuni when he gave the teachings, what he said in the Tibet,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:30.760
 "Listen carefully and keep that," what did you listen, "hold in the mind and then I

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:38.320
 will explain to you." That's the teaching said. So what that actually means in the

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.000
 teaching said, even you are in the teaching, sometimes we are not listening

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.440
 carefully. And what is there, those are the errors of the listenings, errors of

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:56.040
 the mistakes of listening. Now, not attentive listening is like the

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:03.200
 port are upside down. No matter how much the pool, the water or liquid, it won't go

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.760
 in the port. So is the errors of the listening, listening, errors of

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:19.400
 listening. That's the first mistake. And then, and if you don't keep what you

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:26.160
 heard into the heart with memorize or convey somebody mindfulness, then it is

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:33.200
 like yield in this water. The errors of the mistakes not holding the

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.960
 teaching in the mind as the port has holes. For example, if you pull the whole

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.400
 port, it's not upside down, but it is the regular way. Now, put in the water or

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:56.880
 liquid, but port has a hole. Hole is just sipping away, going away. That is the second

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.800
 mistake of the listeners in the teaching said, the second mistake. And then, third

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.520
 mistake is the mixed with the emotions. Where you listen to the teachings, all the

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.680
 different, again, emotions of the our past, the present or the future plans,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.320
 again, is hovering in the brain or hovering in the mind, and a little bit of

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:25.060
 Dharma is coming to you. But it all mixed with that. That is liquid or the pure

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:32.920
 liquid is mixed with the very diluted kind of like liquidus or diluted maybe

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:40.320
 some degree, contaminated. Contaminated. That is third mistakes. And so, for that

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.880
 reason, gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni mentioned in the teaching,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:53.920
 "Teaching, listen carefully and keep that in the heart, then I will explain to you."

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.740
 Those are really in the teaching said, that is what how you listen. You listen

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:06.120
 with attitude of the how wonderful, how precious, how special. This is

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.960
 something that I want to do. It's going to help the benefit to myself and that I

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.120
 can benefit for other scientific beings. I can purify my obscurations,

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.620
 negativities, and we can reactivate our joy and appreciation, courage and

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.680
 commitment, realization in both each other, inherent in nature. How wonderful, how

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.560
 beautiful. Come to that attitude, feel the precious feeling, feel the

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.100
 special feeling. Listen. Then that is called the perfect listening. So here, he's

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.440
 only doing it when he's saying, "Listen with that." These two students who

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.320
 recognize that they are very earnest, they were interested in that. And so, but again,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:56.480
 this. So carefully listen these two. Then, next one is really from here to

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.680
 up to here. This human body is the freedom advantage is difficult to

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.720
 obtain and from that you must complete the ultimate aim. Until that,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:17.080
 until that three lines explaining the basic Buddhism foundation teachings, basic

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.520
 Buddhism foundation teachings, which is known as then poor points of the

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.880
 nature, poor point of the phenomena systems, realities. Many times it is also

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.760
 known as poor renounceations, poor attitude that reverse the mind from

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:43.240
 samsara to the dharmas. Dharmas, those are summarized teaching. But I added

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.480
 these small things that you can see here. That is, the first is explanation of how

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.060
 those poor renounceations or poor attitudes of the post precious human

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.680
 body or precious life. Second is impermanent. Third is the cause and

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:09.360
 effects are inevitable. And fourth is samsara has difficulty. I think that's

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.680
 it. Those are the four points. This is what here said, I adopted that from the

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:22.280
 kenji pande karamojis teaching or compiled teaching. Teaching, I put this,

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:28.400
 but this is not kenji pande karamojis world or nor my world or any other, but

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.520
 those are the great masters in the Buddha's world teaching exactly in the

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:39.360
 highlight here. And that first one is who said shanti deva. You know the shanti

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.240
 deva. Second one is where I said that the excellent display sutta, that is the

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.520
 Buddha's teaching. No jacarabha is the Buddha's teaching is actually Buddha's

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:57.080
 life story, sutta, that explain of how Buddha was born. Third is, and here

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:03.880
 I said too, instruction to the king. That is again Buddha's teaching. And the

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:11.600
 next one is also in a, following is a Buddha teaching. And what is, again, this

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.800
 jacarabha or the display sutta. The extensive display sutta says all

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.880
 Buddha's as well as a great master's teaching. So it's not something that, but

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.520
 that, so I highlighted this here, that we all can see this clearly that, so it can

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.480
 understand. And this is, although this polarization is, condense the meaning of

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:43.840
 the post to truth of the poor noble truths. Post poor noble truths, you all

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:51.760
 know that. Again I listed that. First is suffering truth. And the second is cause

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:59.040
 of suffering truth. Third is and cessation truth.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:08.280
 Post is a path, a path truth. So those are the poor truth. But this poor truth is, we

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.800
 divided that into two groups. Post is teaching, person or is, post to truth of

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:23.560
 its teachings on the samsara. Second to truth is teachings on the nirvana. Post to

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.480
 truth is teachings on the samsara. Second to truth of these teachings on the

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:36.760
 nirvana. Both samsara and nirvana is not happening by itself. It is happening by

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:46.480
 the cause and condition and it is a result. Cause and conditions are known as

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.600
 source of suffering truth, for example, you see. Solve the suffering truth. That is

00:21:53.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 cause of samsara. And the result is then, what is it called? Result of the cause of

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:10.360
 suffering produced is suffering truth. So that is samsara. Samsara has a cause

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:16.840
 and condition. The nirvana has cause and condition result. Way that happening, way

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.800
 that works, that is known as in the Buddha's teaching, known as interdependent

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:31.040
 coordination or interconnected systems. This cause is not just one single entity

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:41.440
 object that are producing everything. No. That cause has so many again, sub causes.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.760
 So many sub causes. They go all cooperating together. Condition is not

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:55.320
 just one condition. Entities. So many conditions. Way cause and conditions are

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:04.640
 working is completely cooperating, magically interconnecting, without

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:13.560
 clashing, without bouncing, harmonizing and cooperating. That is known as

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:21.080
 magically displaced. Where this display is happening, have you, we think carefully,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:30.040
 is all happening in the emptiness states. Emptiness states. Each of those cause and

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:41.040
 conditions, sub cause and sub conditions, are all particles. All are sub

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.960
 particles. Sub particles of the sub particles. So many sub particles.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.200
 Cooperating together and together is working in a way. And each of those

00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.240
 accordant teaching, so much spaces, so much losers, losers, that's what they can

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.800
 work together. App is so much solid, everything can work. But all cooperatives

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:16.600
 so magically, that's what is magic. Magic. So therefore, this first four, this four,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:24.360
 renouring third is essence of teachings of the first four novel, first two novel

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:30.440
 truth of the four novel truths. I think you understand. First two novel truths. So

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:37.280
 this, that's it. And yeah, so that is what. And now this is, so what are those? First

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:49.760
 is, precious life. This our life is so important. It's so precious. But it is

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.280
 also a point that is so many different things. It's not just, our life is just a

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:03.560
 one-piece object. There's so many variety of the things. There's elements. Five

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:13.920
 elements. Our body has five elements. Fire, water, wind, earth, and space. All that with

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:20.360
 this body. And then our body is also gross level in what in the teaching said. Five

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:28.640
 aggregates. Poem aggregates, feeling aggregates, perception aggregates,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:35.520
 consumption aggregates, consciousness aggregates. All the five aggregates with

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:44.320
 five elements, all cooperated. It's a combination of the Guru all together.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:51.360
 It's now together. Since it's a Guru, it's not just a came to the Guru from the

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:59.480
 big and less time. It's newly arrived. For that means, newly arrived means before.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:12.440
 According our age. For me, maybe our 70 years ago, it's arrived. Not before. Not

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.760
 before. How long this is going to stay? It's newly arrived 70 years ago. How long

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:26.480
 this will stay like this? Wish so long. That's the wish. But how long realistically we

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:33.240
 can, how long can stay? It's all together now. There's so many put, not just one,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.720
 those five, five elements, five aggregates, but beside that there's so many other

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.520
 things really. So therefore, well everything, this kind of beautiful, that

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.240
 function, a beautiful quality is so special. This body is so special. It's

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.360
 precious. It's so precious. It's difficult to obtain,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:08.160
 obtain it. And then the larger level in the Buddha teaching, teaching here. And in

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.800
 the Buddha teaching, always said, it's so difficult to, to obtain this, to compare

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:21.360
 with how many, this our life, what we call this our life, is according to Buddha's

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:29.160
 teaching, these luxurious lives. And in according to Buddha's teaching, there's six

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:37.800
 rams. Six rams. Our rams is upper rams. And there's lower rams and upper rams.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.400
 Upper rams, lower rams has three lower rams, which is hell rams, and the hungry

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:54.120
 ghost, animal rams. And three upper rams, human, asura, god rams. We are in human rams.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:02.960
 It's upper rams. So to compare with all the lower rams, we have so many luxuries.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.320
 So many beautiful. This human love has so many luxuries. So many beautiful things.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.400
 But yet, also it's very subtle to compare with, with according to Buddha's teaching

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.600
 on Buddhism, even though they say that so many human population is, but to compare

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.160
 it with the, with the population of the animals and human population is just a

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:31.840
 can't, the human population is so small. Really, even though to come, I would say

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.360
 the human population is growing and all that, but to compare it with the animal

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:42.940
 populations and the human population is so, so small. Among the human

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.040
 populations, those who are engaged with the kind of decent attitude of

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.840
 loving-kindness of comparison and appreciation and respect to each other

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:58.280
 and all beings, how many people do that? Even the human beings, among the human

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.680
 beings, how many people? But those who have a little bit decent attitude of the

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.320
 other beings, their lives are so precious and important and respect, they have attitude,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:15.080
 that is very seldom, very special. And some degree, we all have that. Dharma

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.200
 practitioners who are really have that, maybe not all the time, but at least the

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:26.640
 on and off, on and off whether, but Dharma practitioners has more than many other

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.880
 peoples. That is very special in Buddhism. It's really so special. So all this

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:39.680
 special qualities, well we're here, now now we want to make more special for the

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.800
 time and the joyful effort to make something special for now and for the

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.440
 future and more for the future. That is known as using our spiritual life in a

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:58.440
 meaningful way to benefit ourselves to all the beings. And then here, it's said

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:04.760
 that, yeah, and if we don't use this great Master Shanti, they were said, I mean, it's

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.800
 translated already in here, but it's very difficult to gain these, again,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.720
 opportunities. It's difficult to gain these opportunities because our, this

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:23.400
 according to teaching, our life, or the lives of every living being follows with

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:30.080
 Karma, so that if we don't do really nice in this lifetime, time, maybe our

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.480
 future Karma will be different. And this certainly our, this life situation, this

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.960
 life, what we are, that is result of the past Karma according to Buddha teaching. So

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.440
 that means we can tell, past Karma is quite good, we did good things. But now

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.620
 if we do continue to do, future will be then good. If we don't do exactly as we

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.440
 should do, and then our future life will be maybe not exactly good, good, or can't

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:06.360
 know. Therefore, we should really, really do very, as much as we can do good things

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:14.680
 in these lives. So that is really about the first this precious human body, body

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:26.640
 or the precious lives among the poor, poor. And next one is then impermanent. This is

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:33.120
 again, generally, I think whenever you know, this poor noble truth, poor noble

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:41.360
 truth, first noble truth, suffering truth can be divided into poor groups, poor.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:49.360
 Those are known as the, and the suffering truth is divided, now poor noble

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:55.400
 truth. Poor noble truth can be divided, each of those as poor, poor, poor. And then

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:11.560
 that makes all 16, 16 groups of the, not groups, 16, 16 truthers, 16 truthers, I

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:19.640
 think, Denshong, 16 truthers. Poor noble truth is divided as, and I think many of

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.080
 you maybe you know, but many of you maybe did not heard this or that. So I will

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:32.040
 list this four. First is called impermanent, mada. Second is suffering,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:41.240
 mada dongar. And the third is the emptiness. Poor is egoless. These four are

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.800
 the first poor noble truth. Normally we call the poor noble, poor noble,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:54.960
 post suffering truth. The suffering truth is divided into these four, impermanent,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:02.040
 suffering, emptiness, and egolessness, egoless. This is the four. How that is

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:09.600
 actually said, said. This, this is because in the Buddha's teaching, teaching, there's

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:18.040
 the fourth, there is nothing is solid. Nothing object is in samsara, is really

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.920
 solid, is impermanent. This also noble truth is Buddha's teaching, is teaching

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:31.120
 of the, known as teaching of the wisdom, teaching of the intelligence. Buddha see

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.800
 exactly where things are operating on the relative level. Buddha see things

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:43.120
 exactly where things are in absolute level. And speaking that exactly as he

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:49.840
 see, that is known as wisdom teachings. So if this is a wisdom teaching, wisdom.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:56.680
 And so the fourth Buddha see the all these things, samsara or everything what

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:05.360
 you see is really impermanent. There's no one, nothing in the impermanent. This

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:12.040
 the permanent has a true impermanent. That is gross impermanent and subtle

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:19.280
 impermanent. Gross impermanent we all know. Every sentient being, every human being

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.300
 will know or mostly. Gross impermanent because things, oh now the building

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:35.340
 collapsed. Or that person died. We see is changed. Or is getting old. Or they

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:41.800
 are getting sick. Those are gross impermanent. Easy. But subtle is impermanent

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:51.840
 is so subtle we, our wisdom knowledge cannot detect. So subtle. And those were

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:58.680
 known as the instant impermanent. Subtle impermanent. This gross impermanent is

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:06.360
 not just a happening by that moment. It was pushed and caused by the subtle

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:14.360
 impermanent that happened all the time. That created that big change that we

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:22.400
 see. The gross impermanent. So subtle impermanent is so subtle, so refined. And

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.240
 is every, there's no, what is the example or what is the characteristic of the

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:35.240
 impermanent. It said the impermanent means the moment it's, moment you see that

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:42.800
 moment changed. That is a characteristic of the impermanent. Moment it is existing,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:50.280
 that moment is changed. It's moving. So that means, relatively we talking, there's

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:59.080
 nothing is sitting even one second. It's really moving force. Moving force. Where

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:07.120
 that happening? In the space of the emptiness. All that happening. And so

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.240
 therefore, every, many great masters say, if you have the realization of the

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.440
 impermanent, that subtle impermanent realization, then you won't have the ego.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:22.840
 Attachment too. Even the attachment won't. Because attachment means something to

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:30.480
 holding. Clinging. Holding. So then every subtle change, that means not just that

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.840
 object is changing that way, but all subject is changing like that too. There's

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:43.960
 no staying existing. Once, one instant. There's no one instant really staying.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:50.480
 Even our consciousness is moving fast. So therefore, attachment, there is nothing

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.920
 substantial solid existing. Attachment is also moving. Moving. And therefore, also

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.920
 the ego, there's nothing really existing in a way. So for those reason, many times

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.480
 this impermanent is so special teaching. I mean, again, of course, Buddha's

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.520
 teaching, there's many are known as lines wrote teaching. Not many other great

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:18.200
 masters spoke, but Buddha spoke those is very special teaching. And this is

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:24.240
 impermanent, one of the special teaching of the Buddha. Buddha, which is not

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.800
 making up things, or it's not something that you have to believe is happening. We

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.300
 can see some degree. Ourself, we can validate our own cognitions.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:43.040
 So therefore, it is a wisdom teaching, so impermanent. That is what impermanent.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:49.800
 And then, this is, I just will give really that thought. The second one, second

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.680
 subdivision of the suffering truth is suffering. Why is called suffering? It's

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:04.080
 because it's emotions, all created by the emotions. What that means, the emotions,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:12.720
 emotions of the anger, attachment, jealous, and grasping, clinging, created the

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.480
 things. Therefore, it is trouble, is the difficulty, is the challenge, is the

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:28.760
 suffering. Suffering. Because that is what the emotions are, trouble. So therefore,

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:37.520
 it is suffering, that. And then, is it empty? Third subdivision of the

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:45.520
 suffering truth, empty. What means? Empty means everything, there's not any solid

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:52.360
 existing, and there's no behind the scenes. There is no one is controlling this all

00:38:52.360 --> 00:39:00.240
 situation, the circumstances. There's no controllers in Buddhism. It's

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.240
 empty. You don't, by the valid cognition, you can validate that there's no one is

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:14.720
 controlling. Controlling. It's empty of controlling. Controlling by any means of

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:23.400
 powers. It's self is functioning. It's self is performing. So that is third

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.120
 subdivision of the empties, of the suffering truth. And all this difficulty

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.600
 troubles, the challenges, there's no one is controlling, is all disciplines, all

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:44.640
 happening, by the cause and condition and effect systems. Then, that third one, ego

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.800
 subdivision, fourth one, ego subdivision, fourth subdivision, the

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:59.440
 egolessness. Egolessness means, again, there is no, again, controller of the ego

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:06.840
 existing within each of our aggregates. If you look to the form

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:14.160
 aggregates, there is no egos, the controller. That book say, or I am the

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:21.240
 controller of the ego. And if you look to the peeling aggregate and perception,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:28.400
 consumption, conscience, each of you look, there is no controllers, nor there's not

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:36.440
 any existing egos, or eyes, or self. Self is all empty. There's nothing. For that

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:42.840
 reason, this is called fourth subdivision of the suffering truths. Suffering truth.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.640
 So therefore, this impermanent. This is what we are teaching here.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.760
 Teaching is this gross impermanent. Here, what is it? The three realms are the

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.960
 impermanent, like the clothes, or the autumns. It's subtle, it's happening all the time,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:05.320
 but Buddha highlight here, the gross impermanent. And gross impermanent is

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:12.160
 three realms, are like, like as the impermanent, they are like the clothes in the

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:18.640
 autumn skies, always in changing. And when you look to our, the lives of the human

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:26.200
 beings, or the lives of enemies or animals, human beings is like, like place on the

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:32.200
 stages. Place on the stage is never going to stay forever. On the, like such as

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:38.720
 Broadway shows, how long that Broadway show goes, that, that particular one. Three

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:46.440
 hours for hours. Then it's gone. Similarly, the our lives and lives of the human

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:53.840
 beings, or all the animals, all is like, just like, like place. It's changed, it's

00:41:53.840 --> 00:42:00.200
 changed. It's like somebody else looking to this world, how our lives are changing,

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:06.960
 all that is really like, as like dance or play. It's just changing so many things,

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.920
 one after another. So it's like, for that reason, reason is just all lives are like

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.760
 looking to the, to the dance, similar with the play force. And then our life is

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:32.320
 like, like it moves so fast, as like, like lightning in the sky, or water gushing

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:39.200
 from the steep mountains, is really learning. And life is so, in that way, so

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.560
 important. From the time we born, until now, life is continually moving, forward,

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:55.360
 forward, to that destination. Nations, no, no, no one can stop, never going to change,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.160
 is continuous. So therefore, again, in the teaching set, that, well, everything is in

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:12.600
 our sight. One, while everything is our, our reach is so, so important. Really we do

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:19.000
 some good things to practices. And that is explaining in here. Here, the practice is,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.680
 then, this is cause and calmness, calmness here, that the contemplate on the unerring

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.080
 of the cause and the effect, the sutra instruction of the king says, we can go

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.040
 tomorrow. I mean, of course, you will know this. It's not something that, but he said,

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:44.160
 said, in that teaching, he said, that what is really, when we leave this world, what

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:52.640
 will come? What will come with us? Only that we develop with our consciousness.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.400
 With our consciousness is, according to Buddhism, our consciousness is travelling.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:05.960
 Our body and our everything will stay behind. We can't take anything. But our

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:13.640
 consciousness will move forward. Whatever we develop with our consciousness, that

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:22.840
 will come with us. So that is known as, then, such as karmas. Every activity, whatever

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:32.600
 performance we do, it has imprint or it has karma. It created the habit patterns,

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:43.240
 habituals. That habituals are registered in the karma banks. Karma banks. That karma

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.400
 bank is alaya in the accord of Buddhism or the subconscious storehouse. It really

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:55.960
 registered everything. So that bank, that will come with us. Karma. If it's a good

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:01.960
 karma, that will come with us. If it's a bad karma, it will come with us. That is

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:09.480
 really the welcome. So therefore, this is so, here, the great Buddha giving this

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.920
 teaching to this, he's one of the disciples, famous, or king disciples, which is

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:23.680
 Jarpa Sajyar, is king of Kosalas. In that time, in the Buddha's time, there is six

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:30.680
 great cities or kingdoms in India and one of these Kosala kingdoms. In modern

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:36.560
 time, or not modern time, ancient time, it is also known as Shavastha. That area is

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:43.480
 very famous, the king known as King Sajya, Prasanjita in Sanskrit, in Tibet, is known

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.780
 as Sajyal. So Buddha gave me instruction to this king and that's what he

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:54.080
 said in here, here, the translator. And that is my talk today and then we

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.840
 continue. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you, thank you very much for

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.800
 participating. Thank you, thank you. Now we do the short dedication prayer, which is

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.480
 here. And then, right after that, if you have time, you will join with our evening

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:16.020
 practices. If you don't have time, and that's it, then, but this is after this

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:27.720
 dedication prayer in the page, page 19 and this. By this merit, may all obtain the

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:32.440
 omniscient, may all defeat the enemy wrongdoing from the strong waves of the

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:37.240
 birth, the old, the sickness, and the death from the ocean of the samsara, may I free

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:43.150
 all beings. May the soul, soul, and the benefit of happiness, the Buddha's teachings remain for a

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.200
 long time.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.240
 May the victory banner of the lives of the known ones, the holders of the teachings of the main

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.160
 family.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.600
 May all the many beings, always be joyful. May all the verses of the lower ends cease forever.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:03.010
 May the wishes of all the Buddhist authors and all the women of the religion at this very moment

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.160
 for the people of the nations of the Earth,

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.560
 may not even the names, disease, famine, war, and suffering be heard.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.960
 But rather may pure conduct, merit, wealth, and prosperity increase,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.880
 and may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.280
 The precious bodhicitta in those without it may it be generated,

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.240
 and those who have it may it never diminish, but always continue increasing.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:33.930
 May the great tradition of kenpo, shankarakshita, lopan, pasa, and bhava, and dharma king, krits

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:34.600
 and detsan,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.640
 increase and spread throughout the three-round world.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.560
 May the appearance of the three jewels and the mind-streets of beings

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.600
 remain inseparable in the springs of life well-being throughout the three times.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:52.200
 deity, mantra, and dharmakaya are the nature of appearance, sound, and awareness.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.560
 The pervasive kaya, wisdom display of the buddhas,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.320
 may practitioners of the profound and secret great perfection

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:05.880
 remain inseparable from the innermost, on taste, awareness of wisdom.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:12.840
 Okay, thank you. Thank you very much everyone. Again, thank you.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.720
 Thank you. As I said, if you have time, please join our practices,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.120
 and if not, then we will see the continuous day after tomorrow, I think.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.800
 Okay, thank you. Thank you very much everyone.
