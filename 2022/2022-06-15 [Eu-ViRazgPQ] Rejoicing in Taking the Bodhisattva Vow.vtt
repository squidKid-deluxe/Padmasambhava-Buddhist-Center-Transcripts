00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
 The ego-clinging is a self-important attitude. According to the teachings of the Buddha, we

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:16.800
 had so many lifetimes. Even there are no numbers. From the speaking list, until now, we carry

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 the self-important and the ego-clinging all the time. But today, by the teachings of the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.600
 greatest teacher, Buddha Shakta Muni, and teachings of the great, all those Bodhisattvas,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 we are reversing that direction. We are reversing that right today. So how wonderful, how beautiful

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.360
 it is. Today, I go something so special that I never dreamed in my life, from beginning

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.440
 at times. Today, I did. How wonderful. So really, rejoice, our happy deed, and something

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.600
 happy. And then, because of that, when we did that, and not just only us or only we,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.120
 but according to all the Bodhisattvas' eyes open, they see our intention told. They watched.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.240
 They are also rejoicing. They are glorifying. They are collapsing. They are cheering out.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 I'm not teaching. I'm totally teaching. They are also wonderful. Not just only the Buddha's

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.600
 bodhisattvas. All the sentient beings are joy. Now they don't have to be scared with us.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 We are their friends. We are going to help support and benefit them. We are not aliens

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.920
 of them. We are going to mingle with them. How wonderful. Every level is rejoiced in the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.360
 beautiful. That is what this is. So really, feel that from the heart, and then we join

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.960
 together this one.
