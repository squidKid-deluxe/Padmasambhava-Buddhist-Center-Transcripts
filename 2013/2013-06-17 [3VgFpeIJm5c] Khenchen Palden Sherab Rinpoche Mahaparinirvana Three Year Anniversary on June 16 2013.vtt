00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.210
 Thank you. Thank you again. Thank you for coming. And this again, as we all know, this is one of

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.700
 the very special moments and a special time and a special day for all of us, for all of us who are

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.110
 connected to receive the teachings of the proponent of the Buddha Chakra Mani from this great

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.000
 master.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.240
 For so many years we received rebut by the authentic teaching of the Buddha Chakra Mani. We show

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.520
ered by this great teaching practice, it's observing our heart and mind. Truly, this is what we

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.000
 celebrated today.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 We remember all the wisdom, all the wisdom and the concursions of the teaching of the Buddha and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.270
 all the great master that echoed throughout the Himalayan mountains and the Tibetans and all beyond

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.000
 the Tibet and Kontuna came here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.110
 And this great teacher brought such great teachings, authentic teaching of the Buddha Chakra Mani

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.060
 that used to practice in India and matured so many beings in the enlightened state according their

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.000
 practices.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.170
 And the offering of the Buddhist historicists on the three liberation status. Liberation state of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.320
 the Arhata, Liberation state of the Parthiya Buddha, and the Liberation state of the Bodhisattva Y

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.000
anas, their total enlightened state, and then truly the Vaidhyana states.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.410
 Those who attended teaching that brought to this country is one of the beacon of the great Buddhist

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.000
 light that in this part of the world he truly was and he came, he left with beautiful magnificently

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.000
.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 Exactly what the teaching said, exactly what we learned, this great master did exactly that way. He

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.390
 came, he did, he left beautiful, he left beautiful monument, legacy, that we remembered through

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 generations to generations to come.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.190
 So today we're celebrating of his memories, but the same time we're celebrating of our old

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.000
 achievement indeed, what we did throughout these last three years.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.030
 And through the assistance of the many devoted Sangha members, the dedication of the Sangha members

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.000
, truly we achieved so many marvelous things in this country and as well as out of this country.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.230
 That representative of the, always in the Buddha teaching said, that representative body of the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.060
 enlightened beings, that represent the speech of enlightened beings, that represent the mastermind

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.790
 of the enlightened beings, that representative of the qualification of enlightened beings, that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.000
 represent the activity of the enlightened beings.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 In that part context, we come, I think we did quite good, through again, everyone joined targets.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.050
 As this great master used to say, lifting the carpet from poor corners, corners, we truly, we left

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.000
 the carpet from poor corners, we did.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.320
 Today we rejoice of all our teachings, the good things. Representative of the bodies of the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.830
 enlightened activity, Saki, look this, this beautiful image, that representative of the old lineage

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.490
, very important lineage master, that which is curved, again, dedicated Sangha members, Felix, many

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.460
 of you know, his marvelous skills and dedication and love to the Dharma and the lineage, and really

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.000
 he curved.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:40.930
 Those are the many of you, maybe we know. There is a great master, Subhchi, Saji, Yeshi, Rambuchi.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.450
 There is a great master, Patamba Saji, who was the founder of the Shivzi lineage, or the pacifying

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.000
 suffering, that pacify the suffering lineage, and then, as well as great Taksanghamsa.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.080
 Right in front of the door, I believe, the first one is the tips of the Sangha also, that we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.720
 received this great teaching from these great masters, six, seven years ago, maybe, about that time

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.450
, in this marvelous, beautiful, incursivable, lawful land of the Vihara, in this beautiful place, we

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.000
 received those teachings.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.810
 Authenticity, we observe and we preserve with our courage and commitment, devotion. Those are the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.000
 light, that so many, like, proper spirit, enlightenment.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.340
 There is nothing really different at all, is how we handle this. Those are the great teaching. Only

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.000
 is question how we handle with devotion, courage, and commitment, and joyful effort.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.200
 And we have that enough. Those Taksanghamsa are the gingling lineage teaching. So many of whom are

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.000
 rich in enlightenment.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.160
 And Taksanghamsa, himself, become the transcendental, versatile, random body, in the Buddhist

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.000
 history, or the nimam of Buddhist history.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.160
 He is one of the great masters, who achieved the transcendental, versatile, random body, around the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.000
 11th century, or the 10th century.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.840
 He is one of the early, that great masters. And the next one is, I think, Rungzungpa, great master

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.000
 of Rungzungpa.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.490
 We again had a great opportunity to receive from these great teachers, K.G. Paddy Kheranabud, who

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.770
 gave the so detailed teachings, how to establish and bring out every phenomenon, systems in the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.000
 divine mandala, in light mandala.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.960
 That is the great master always in the nimam of Buddhist history. He said, "Great Rungzungpa, great

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.000
 Rungzungpa, this is true as sun and moon."

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.790
 I like in the Buddhist history, or the nimam of Buddhist history, in some scholars, particularly,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.000
 also, scholarly aspect of that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.050
 Of course, they are totally enlightened beings. And I realize that I can't expect that so many

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.000
 great beings come one after another.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.400
 But the scholarly aspect of that, these are two great teachers, Rungzungpa and as well as Nungzung

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.000
pa.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 So, this is Rungzungpa's image.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And then, another one, the next one, is known as the iron breadboard.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.440
 Whenever you heard, he is one of the great, again, Mahasadas, great thetan, great master kundra,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:17.000
 great kundra, mentioned about him, to begin to mention about him.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 He said, "When Guru Pima Sambawat came in the form through the womb."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.900
 That means according to his story, Guru Pima Sambawat appeared from the Lord, or middle of the Lord

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.000
 was appeared.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 But he, the great Nungzungpa said, "Guru Pima Sambawat came through the womb, through the womb."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And that is known as the tan-dungwa, the tan-dungjapawat.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.170
 His union of the Guru Pima Sambawat in the teaching said, "Hi, I'm Guru Pima Sambawat, target came

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.000
 as one single form, the tan-dungjapawat, iron breadboard."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.800
 And whenever, again, I heard, I heard from his story, he was just among the first great men who

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.000
 built the iron bread through the big rivers.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.110
 In the whole world, his story, I heard, I mean, you can correct those things, but I heard that he

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:20.000
 is one of the really first great iron breadboarder that he built the iron bread from the big rivers

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.000
.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.080
 In Tibet, there is, you see, one hundred eight iron bread that he built, one hundred eight iron

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.000
 breads.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And there's still, there's two of them left.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And his techniques are so unusual that that's who came in the 14th century, 14th century.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.770
 Until now, those irons, there's still those who are, which are their bread, because irons are not r

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.000
usted, rusted.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Many scientists are who think of how, what kind of technique he used. That's what they're used.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.610
 And also he was one of the, in the world level, of the kind of public service levels, as I said, he

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.000
 built the iron, iron breads.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.390
 And as well as also, he is the first, I think, creator to be the Dharma, those are known as the pl

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.000
umber, the big kind of organized men, he created the Dharma.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.240
 And in the teaching said, or life story said, because there's so many four purpose, bagels and

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.000
 hundreds, because particular hundreds, he liked to avoid that hundred, hundred.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.620
 But same time, those purpose are four, that they are hundred, not just for the pleasure, but they

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.000
 are hundred for their perseverable, surviving purposes.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So therefore, he created this Dharma, known as plumber.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And there's a future plumber and they just started playing that through that, then they converted,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 or they changed their profession into non-violent space.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So again, he was one of them. And then, a particular course, he developed so many Thema teachings,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 a great lineage of orders.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.890
 And the teachings said, him many times went around the world, world, world, and benefiting so many

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.000
 beings through his magic, or the worst of enlightened wars, said.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And so, he was also a long life, over 120, 110, 150, many purpose said that he stayed.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.470
 And in the area, for example, everybody thought he was a fast way, and right after that, somebody

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.000
 saw different other places.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 He still walking the same way, going different places.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.340
 So many purpose said that even though he showed at one place, he passed in some other areas, that

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.000
 he is still active.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 So he's just, that is kind of illusion, that of course in the teaching.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Always say that. So this is the great Thangthong pass, Thangthong pass.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And then, as well as, we have a beautiful statue, a beautiful statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 a marvelous statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni, about six feet, in another sight.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.370
 And as well as, then also we have a process of making the statue of the K.T. Vardhishara himself,

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.000
 and his host, Duryubhuti,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 and Yogi, Pima, Sucham, the Lama, Jancho.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.530
 That statue is a process of traumatic, and those are all representative of the body, the

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.000
 enlightened body aspects,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 a body of the enlightened activities.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And the speed aspect of the enlightenment, and again, we have to, there's so many things,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 but again, in these last three years, we are able to publish an English version, about almost like,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 about three, no,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 no, seven volumes, seven books we are able to publish it, no, our seven books.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.750
 Our seven books we are able to publish it in honor, and as representative of the K.T. Vardhishara M

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.000
ookie,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 and as well as, his own, Duryubhuti, and hidden Yogi Lama Jancho,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 and as well as, all the linear masters.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.460
 So that we are able to publish it in the, in the, in the context of both each other, in the

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.000
 devotion.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.360
 Hope this not just become the monument in one time, but in the teachings it, it will continue to

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.000
 benefit.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 For all the sentiments, as long as I always think, as long as the language of English existing,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 books are published in English, will continue to ignite and inspire,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 in the deepening of the practice of the Buddha, Dharma, that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 So we are able to do that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 And then representative of the speed, and what's the mind of the enlightened beings?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 We are able to do this always in the stupas.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So we are able to do so many stupas through your understanding.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 As you know, there is so many stupas surrounded in the memory of the K.T. Vardhishara Mookie,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 and as well as three beautiful stupas above our five feet.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Handcraft, best crafts means, curve, three stupas.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 One in the Karmic Republic areas, beautiful.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 I have the great opportunity to part of that and concentrate on that last, my trip, this last month

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.000
.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 And as well as, two beautiful stupas in Gauti monastery, and as well as, Rauti monastery.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Those are a compliment of the great wisdom, the mind of the enlightenment.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And the qualities and activities, then we continue to maintain of the qualities,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 always in the teachings, the qualities of the enlightened beings is true love, devotion, bodhicata.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And those are, we try to maintain ourselves as much as we are able to do.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 With our courage and commitment, we did something quite good.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 We didn't decrease our devotion and joy and bodhicata, truly we suddenly increase it.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 So therefore, increase it in a deepening, and those are the qualities of the old enlightenment.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.420
 Activities of the enlightenment beings, again, through their blessings, through their enlightenment

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.000
 activities,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 we continue to maintain the activities of all different activities that what we used to do.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 So this is all as offerings and to the old enlightened beings,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 and to our great teachers, Gauti bodhicata, Rauti.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And as well as, we rejoice of all our deeds. That's what we did.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.390
 So I'm so thankful, so grateful, all of you who participated in everything to come to this

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.000
 beautiful time and beautiful places.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And thank you again. Thank you very much everyone's participation and everyone's joy and devotion.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 We did this celebration. Thank you, thank you, and thank you.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And now I'm going to say last, to remembering, through this Anthony, our spirit is up.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Thank you everyone. Thank you. That was loud and clear.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Thank you everyone, please.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.030
 And then, I think the evening, I think whether it's rainy or not, I think that we usually do the

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.000
 practices in the evening.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 We do that in order to get there on the court day, right?
