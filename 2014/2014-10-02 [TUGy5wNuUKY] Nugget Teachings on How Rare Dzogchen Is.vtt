00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 "Now again we continue to follow the natural teaching of the great living masters that continue.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.240
 It is nugget, it is very huge. All of these great masters, one more is said, one more in everyone,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.520
 even in the entire universe, once with gold, yellow and diamonds, we won't get this kind of

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.200
 teaching.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.440
 This is a nugget teaching, and the teaching says it is the heart, drug of the mother of

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 Stumrahini, all those enlightened. This is what they practiced, that was what they achieved,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 and that's what they benefited all sentient beings. That trick, we are right in front of us,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.400
 and we are drawing that back to us, and trying to activate our beautiful qualities that we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.280
 inherited.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.400
 As Chapa pointed out, or as we went through one after another, we went through, we connected back

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.040
 to the source, we connected the heart, we connected the best, we connected very, very fundamental

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.680
 goal

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 of the teaching, and that's how all expanded. We went through, and today this is what again

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.680
 we continue. So therefore, as I said always, and as a great master, one more is said, this is what

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.360
 always we heard, so many times, from the great kindness voice of K.G. Vardisharabhud so many times,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.880
 again, again, resisting the beautiful motivation of the joy and appreciations, and both each other,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.440
 and as well as all this beauty, understanding of nature. This is not just, as I said many times,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.240
 we're not just doing some care work to please the lineage masters of Buddha's body. That is very

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.600
 practice of ourself. Both each other is the very practice of our nature. We like to glorify that.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.000
 We like to defeat, or to dissolve, toss it, and liberate all these troublemakers,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.080
 troublemakers. That we like to cleanse and purify. That was what we really like to do. We don't

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.240
 like

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.920
 to suffer in sadness, the difficult troubles that we go through, and we challenge if we go through,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.400
 and all the things that go through, we don't like that. That's what we like to defeat, we like to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 remove, we like to cleanse, we like to liberate. In order to this, we have to go compact to this

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.320
 nature, the reality, call it, of the truth. Not just going to outskirt and burn it out.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.400
 As great master Chhapa said, that the God is inside and walking some kind of way, doing something

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.480
 on

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.320
 the West. West, that's completely different. The target is in some different and hidden somewhere

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.040
 else.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.040
 That is not. This time, we're hidden to the right target, and that starts with both each other,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.720
 that starts with devotion, that starts with joy and apprehensions, and that we start with

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.840
 purely understanding nature, where things are. As Zoki pointed out, true, pure nature is so pure,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.440
 so powerful, beautiful. There's nothing really to need to add, and to subtract anything from that.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.760
 Reality, nature, that. But duality added all day. This time, we are cleansing and purifying

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 what we own it, our mess, we create. Not just somebody else came and did this for us.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.960
 Also created, overloaded, forcefully that. No, it's one's own mistake, must be handled,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.540
 must be handled of the true, natural reality, and then we carry with that, that waves of the dual

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.960
ity,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:53.680
 waves of that, continually carried. So that is what, what is, and therefore again it is that.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.600
 All this beautiful motivation as, I mean, this is what. And then with this, we follow the teaching.
