00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 Thank you very much, thank you for coming again to make such a big effort and to put all the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.000
 activities on the side and kind of put all different things together and then come to the retreat

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 as always.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.150
 I don't think you have to forget this. Thank you very much for your beautiful effort and dedication

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.960
 for this beautiful spiritual virtuous activities that are really wonderful.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 Generally, in our life we have so many beautiful activities that we do, but this is what we are

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.960
 doing.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.910
 The spiritual activity, virtuous activity, is one of the very beautiful, stone-standing practices

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.960
 or activities in our life.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.630
 According to the teaching of the many great masters of Buddha, all of that, with rituals and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.960
 spiritual activity, when we do, it's really going to connect and benefit for us a long time.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.440
 Not just only for short temporary kind of benefit to our subjects, to others, but it's a long-

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.960
lasting benefit.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.310
 That which means Buddhism that you all know, I think you all know, life is not just a cave here,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 new. Our life is not just a beginning or a life.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.140
 Like a beginning, knowledge is not the last. It's one of the chain of life we go through, one after

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.960
 another. This is one of the life.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.370
 Whatever activity we do, we connect with the spiritual, it will carry for a long time as a ripple

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.960
 after throughout our lives.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.080
 Not just only spiritual activity, our every action of what we do, it really will, according to the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.960
 teaching of the Buddhism, it will go a long way.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 And that which is known as a formally Karma. Karma is not just a cave suddenly that happened,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:11.230
 or nor is somebody bought and put for our Lord to ask. It is something that activity we created and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.960
 we continually carry.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 We can experience the result of whatever it is, whether it is good or bad.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.960
 The spiritual activity, which means again Dharma. Dharma is what? Actually what we are talking of,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 Dharma, Dharma, Dharma.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.370
 In the Buddhism, Dharma means our own true nature of the mind. And what is true nature of our own

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.960
 mind?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:45.380
 According to the again teaching, our true nature is loving kindness, compassion, wisdom, the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.960
 openness mind, that is really the nature of the mind.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.770
 Whatever activity we do, and reflect that beautiful nature, love and kindness, compassion, openness

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.960
, and wisdom, today it is the virtuous activities.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.960
 It bread immediately result to one's own self, bring joy and peace, hunger.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.470
 It will balance all those troublesome elements, stressfulness and anxieties and so it will subside

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.960
 that.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.880
 It brings our inner beauty and the garden. Let the shine as the sun shine and begin to spread out

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.960
 all, all, everywhere.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.400
 And we kind of swing with that beautiful attitude and thought, known as you all know the body, then

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.960
 it goes power.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.960
 Power, then what we can imagine, it goes power.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 According to the Buddha's teaching, it really goes power to the effortless states.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.960
 And not just going at that time, but it will go continually to the effortless states.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:00.370
 Power and power and long lasting. So therefore, spiritual activity is one of the very beautiful

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.960
 activities that we can do in our life,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.960
 which is standing tall and firm, strong to our nature and benefits to the others and to our self.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 And today we are going to the highlight of the brain flex.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.960
 A little bit called the Guntha. In English, it is highlighted as wind force practices.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.970
 Wind force practices or the Guntha or the breathing of this breath flex are one of the beautiful,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.960
 really, again, spiritual or the Dharma activities that we can do.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 We can do. So I'd like to talk a brief introduction of this, this breath flex.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.960
 Generally, according to the Buddha's teaching, it is so important to have.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.960
 Whatever spiritual activity, Dharma activity we do, it is a beautiful motivation.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.960
 Motivation is so important. It is a foundation. It is a vital essence. It is a central column.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 And therefore, a beautiful motivation. A breath of joy and appreciation.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 This is not just only the breath flex time, but or raising up the breath flex time.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.960
 But always, every day when we get up, every day we remember that.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.430
 The remote joy and appreciation. Life is a breath. Still this breath is breathing, breathing is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.960
 breathing, breathing.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.960
 It's beautiful. Every situation, circumstance is really quite good.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 It will count the percentage, 100 percent. Every count.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.370
 Our situation, the circumstance, particularly this country, many people are 60 percent, 7 percent,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.960
 80 percent.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.960
 90 percent, maybe, is really good. So therefore, I like that.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 This is also not just come by itself.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.960
 It is a lot of cause and condition. A very close range and a far range.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 All come, that means line up our condition, priority conditions.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.960
 Put joy and appreciation. And combine the joy and appreciation with both each other.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 And we see all this, what we have. To every living beings.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.960
 They all made a plea from the suffering, the difficulty, trouble or so, all the struggling things.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 And all those threaten, the frightening situation, really weak, they are sincerely there.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 And we weak that. If we do that, that is known as essence of the spiritual or dharma in Buddhism.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:45.960
 That is dharma. Whatever, whatever the name we give, dharma or the spiritual or virtuous.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.960
 That is, this is nothing alien, that attitude, thought. It is our nature.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 Your nature, my nature, we are touching to the core of our own true beings or true traders.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.960
 Not ignoring and looking outside somewhere distant.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.960
 We are making meaning for our lives, that moment.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.960
 Even then, the attitude of thought, we have that.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.960
 That is not just thinking, that energy goes.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 The ripple effect of energy goes to you, bring calm, peace, joy.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.960
 Sun is bright, if we had that attitude, all kind of everything.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.960
 Even if the weather is not so good or whatever, it really brighten up.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.960
 So beautiful. Answer yourself.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.960
 It is not just I am making story or the Buddha said that I am repeating that.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.960
 This is true, negative true.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 We are making meaning for our lives, with that.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.960
 So therefore, every morning, then after the big practices, during the practices,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.960
 or the raising of the wind force energies, all distance, we have that motivation.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:06.960
 It really goes so far and so deep and so strong to benefit from all our, to everything.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.960
 Now, raising up the wind force energy or the prayer flag is one of the great virtues.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.960
 In the Buddha's teaching, he said in order to get enlightenment,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.960
 what that means, to reveal our beautiful nature.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.960
 Buddha nature, we need accumulating true merits.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.960
 True merit, you all know this.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.960
 You all know, I know many of you all know this.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.960
 We all know, we all know, everyone.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.960
 True merit known as verse merit and accumulated merit.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.960
 If simply to explain of this true merit, the verse merit is simply

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.960
 relaxing, calmly, calmly, peacefully, and meditating on the true nature,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.960
 the nature of our own mind.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.960
 Calm and peaceful, nothing particularly discriminating these and that things activity.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.960
 Just relaxing, calm and peaceful.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.960
 In a person, moment of preciousness, origin and status.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.960
 When we relax that, according to Buddha's teaching,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.960
 it will reveal, reveal the deep nature of our self

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.960
 and the deep nature of the whole environment.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.960
 Exhale, we think so.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.960
 It brings the openness mind, precious mind,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.960
 and understanding of the nature of the infinite how things are.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.960
 It will bring, and that is known as verse to merit.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.960
 And then, second is accumulation merit.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.960
 Accumulation merit has beautiful motivation,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.960
 joy in appreciations, and both each other, any activity we do.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.960
 Thinking of that, and you do, such as activity,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.960
 beneficial activities, or calm and peaceful activity,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.960
 non-voluntary activity, then it is accumulating the accumulation merit,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.960
 such as raising of the brain flex, wind horse energy.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960
 Wind horse energy is particularly what I call in the teaching said,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.960
 this is really so powerful, the brain, raising of the wind horse,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:26.960
 it's so powerful, powerful and so, so, it pulls the method or the skills.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.960
 Skills means activity that accumulated, accumulated merit very quickly, quickly.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.960
 This is when the energy is generally known as pull up,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.960
 skill means combined with wisdom and compassion.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.960
 So therefore, raising of this brain flex for the wind horse energy

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.960
 is very powerful, speed up to activating our beautiful energies,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.960
 vitalities, and that.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.960
 And it deep down, what is energy now?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.960
 We're talking energy of the loving kindness and compassion.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.960
 Love and compassion, and wisdom, that is energy.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.960
 That is our essence, so it will really help to bring up.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 This every talk will be detailed of this wisdom.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.960
 Those are known as, I'm sure many of you all, you all know this.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.960
 These, those are known as pile of wisdom.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.960
 Those are known as dharmadatta of wisdom,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.960
 and then merrell-like wisdom, equanimity of wisdom,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:44.960
 and distinctively understated wisdom,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.960
 and then all accomplished wisdom.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.960
 So it will rise up that wisdom.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.960
 This is not just wisdom, wisdom.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.960
 It will rise up compassion, kindness, open heart, warm heart.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.960
 When that raise up, what is demolishing?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.960
 The opposite of those are going away.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.960
 Those are put it fine, clean away.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.960
 One is the opposite of the dharmadatta of wisdom,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.960
 which is blocking the non-raising of the dharmadatta of wisdom.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960
 It's ignorance.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.960
 The ignorance are subsided.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.960
 When dharmadatta of wisdom arises.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.960
 What is the opposite of merrell-like wisdom?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.960
 It is anger.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.960
 Merrell-like wisdom is a tiny, our, what's it called?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.960
 Anger is going down.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.960
 Anger is subsiding, always there is love.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.960
 Pushing down or clean away.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.960
 When anger goes out, what is coming out?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960
 Talk to the merrell-like wisdom.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.960
 Love, kindness, compassion.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.960
 Love and kindness, compassion is not just a focus on one direction.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.960
 It's both direction, every angle is a direction.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.960
 That means bring more joy and appreciation to ourselves.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.960
 Feel happy, beautiful, and beautiful outside too.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.960
 Really brings beautiful understanding.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.960
 And that also means we have to bring more openness,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.960
 more courage, more commitment, more patience.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.960
 More bring that.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.960
 That's what is known as merrell-like wisdom.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.960
 Raising directly the anger is going down.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960
 Where is it going?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960
 To the great nature of the vastness.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.960
 There is even no trace that you can find where the anger went.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.960
 The magically arising merrell-like wisdom,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:02.960
 literally disappearing the anger of subsided anger or reducing anger according to our capabilities.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.960
 When we raise up the great wisdom, the equanimities.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.960
 The equanimity of wisdom.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 What is going down?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:23.960
 Then it's going down all that donjars.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.960
 The arrogance.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960
 The equanimity of wisdom, right?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.960
 Raising up in that moment.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.960
 The arrogance.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.960
 The superiority choose.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.960
 That is going down.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.960
 What is actually arrogance?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960
 According to Buddhism,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 arrogance is a combination of the ego clings very directly.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.960
 That I am the best.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.960
 I am the good.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.960
 I am the okey-dokey person.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960
 I am quite okay.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.960
 Even we do all the different funny things,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.960
 still we can't be like, we always assured it to our own self by ego.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960
 I am okay.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960
 I am quite good.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.960
 That is known as arrogance.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.960
 The reality level, everyone is the ego.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.960
 There is no distinction between any of us.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960
 We are on the same earth.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960
 We breathe the same air.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.960
 We eat basically the same food that gives Mother Earth.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.960
 Our need is the same.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.960
 Our desire is the same.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.960
 Our biological structures are the same.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.960
 Our feeling is the same.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.960
 We like to be happy.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.960
 We don't like to be sad, suffering.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.960
 But arrogance, the ego clings.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.960
 The stubbornness of ego clings makes our self so.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960
 Can't be like that.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960
 Oh, it's okay.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960
 I don't care.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:00.960
 All those attitudes arise because due to the ego and arrogance.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.960
 So, therefore, when the economic diversity shines,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.960
 the calm and peace, openness,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.960
 humbleness, humility,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.960
 those naturally become so practical.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960
 Sensibles.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.960
 Sensibles.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.960
 That is what all arises with this.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.960
 That, when it arises in the economic systems.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.960
 When we are arising in such a system,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.960
 such as distinguishing or distinctively understanding

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960
 the awareness of wisdom.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.960
 Or sometimes it's affiliated with the English discrimination of awareness of wisdom.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.960
 But it's not something discriminating these and their things.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960
 It's distinguishable.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.960
 You understand exactly what things are.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.960
 Exactly, I understand this awareness.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.960
 See, things are as it is.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.960
 And that is good.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.960
 See, good as good, bad as bad.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.960
 Then mixture is Mexican and just a mundane, simple, basic knowledge

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.960
 that understands not to bloat by ignorance,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.960
 not bloat by the ego clinging.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.960
 Bring on that realization.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.960
 That is known as distinctively understanding awareness of Muslims.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960
 When that comes clearly,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.960
 our desire, the attachment, the grasping, clinging,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.960
 those hindrance are subsided.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.960
 Subsiding and bring more calm and peaceful.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.960
 And not just always cry me, not always end up.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.960
 Not always end up, not end up.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.960
 This and I need this, I want this, this and that.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.960
 Running day and night and then making ourselves tired

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.960
 and making troubles to the others.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.960
 Peace, the whole time.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.960
 Feel the richness, the inner richness that is coming by.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:07.960
 By then subsiding of those attachment, grasping, clinging,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.960
 clinging and let up the saturation of this beautiful.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.960
 Then discrimination, awareness, Muslims.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:24.960
 Then we bring up the, such as the wisdom of all the accomplished Muslims.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.960
 What is subsiding or what is going on

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.960
 is jealousness.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.960
 That is going on too.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.960
 And there is nothing need be jealous.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.960
 We are all accomplished.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.960
 We are accomplished.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.960
 Jealousness again is part of the tendencies

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.960
 and part of the retinues of the ego clinging.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.960
 Always like competitors, always challenging,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.960
 always kind of like that, and always like restless, restless thinking.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.960
 Kind of like trying to challenge and try to suppress them.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.960
 Nothing need to be suppressed.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.960
 All is accomplished.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.960
 When you have the great wisdom of the dharmadattu

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.960
 and the equanimity, all merry like wisdom

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.960
 and all discrimination, just awareness that every fulfillment comes.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960
 The fulfillment is there.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.960
 Right in this whole, this universal world.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.960
 The world is virtually in the way for us.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.960
 For us.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.960
 Disciplined, gardens, trees, mountains,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.960
 all is in for our usage or for our side.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.960
 There is nothing really we have to be kind of like jealousness.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.960
 Just relax, calm and peaceful.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.960
 Go in, appreciate it and feel great contaminant.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.960
 And then everything will be, have become and goes as magical disciplines.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.960
 So this is what I am talking about.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.960
 This prayer flex or the raising of wind horse energy,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.960
 it will raise up all of us in energies

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.960
 and push down or the clear way or reduce it.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.960
 I should put you down. It's reducing.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:26.960
 Reducing, lowering and demolishing of all the opposite of that.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.960
 Although I have mentioned all those already.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.960
 And that is also according to Vaidyana.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.960
 It's connected with the colors.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.960
 Really it's a colorful prayer flex.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.960
 Colors are very much related to our nature of the mind,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.960
 our inner ritual at us and the Muslims.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.960
 Blue, for example, blue is connected with Dharmadatta Muslims.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.960
 And white is connected with the Meralik Muslims.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.960
 White color.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.960
 And such as then, yellow is connected to the economic Muslims.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.960
 And red is connected or symbolizing,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.960
 symbolizing distinctly under study of all the Muslims.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.960
 Green is connected or symbolizing.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.960
 It is connected or symbolized.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.960
 All are connected.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.960
 So they are connected.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.960
 This is not again made up of these colors and say,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.960
 "Oh, it is presented with."

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.960
 According to the teaching, according to the Dhanthara,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.960
 inner Dhanthara, Esoterical Buddhism,

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.960
 these colors are the reflection of our own mind.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.960
 Our own nature call it.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.960
 Reality in the teaching says that the color is not really outside.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.960
 This color is within our own mind.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.960
 Our nature of the mind.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.960
 Those words is shining.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.960
 Our awareness, even though we don't find awareness,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.960
 but it has multiple colors of natures.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.960
 Multiple natures.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.960
 It has all that multiple.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.960
 For example, when we look at the crystal,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.960
 we don't see the colors of the crystals,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.960
 except that Dhanthara Muslims.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.960
 The reality, it contains the colors.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.960
 At certain conditions, you can see the colors.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.960
 Similarly, the nature of the mind has all.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.960
 And this five words term is not outside.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960
 It is again the nature of the mind.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.960
 So when we put up this brave eraser of the wind force and energy,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.960
 it is what we are really exploring,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.960
 re-glorifying reality level of our inner richness.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.960
 And that will also immediately help our energies,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.960
 our vitality.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.960
 And then it will also reflect external our performance.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.960
 And it will remove our obstacles,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.960
 diseases, sicknesses,

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960
 hindrance,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.960
 and it will firm the goal.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960
 Therefore, in the Tibetan Buddhism,

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 every of those times we go to that, we do learn what is called.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.960
 Many people are asking to do the divineations.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
 Divineations.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.960
 Every time with those lamas or some who work,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.960
 not necessarily always lama,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.960
 but somebody does the divineation,

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960
 and they say,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.960
 "Oh, you need to do this and that thing."

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.960
 And the rest of the brave likes.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.960
 I like to fulfill this goal and activity.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960
 I'm not walking.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960
 It's not my anxiety.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960
 I'm waking.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960
 I tried it so many times again and again,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960
 but it's not work.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.960
 What I should do?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.960
 Can you help or do the divineation on this?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.960
 And when they do the divineation,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960
 most of the time they say,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.960
 "Raise of the brave likes."

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
 Brave likes.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.960
 Because it will clear away the obstacles

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960
 and smoothen it,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.960
 and clear away the passage of the two moving forward.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.960
 Whatever activity we do, perform it.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.960
 So because it's creating such activity.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.960
 That means the action, activity is open.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.960
 And that all our activity,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960
 good, beneficial activity is really moving.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960
 So therefore, for that reason,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.960
 all this is really so, so special

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.960
 to raise of the brave likes.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.960
 Then I talk really of this again,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.960
 where, what place we should raise of the brave likes.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.960
 What kind of motivation we should have

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960
 to raise of the brave likes?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960
 And what time of the two days of the brave,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.960
 when is the best time of the raise of the brave likes?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.960
 What is the benefit, even though I already mentioned it,

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.960
 what is the benefit of this raising of the brave likes?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.960
 And so I talk really about that.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.960
 And the first one is two days of the brave likes.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.960
 Place, place, area.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.960
 Actually, we can raise of the brave likes anywhere.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.960
 Because Buddha's teaching and teaching of Murugan Mahasma

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960
 is really good.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.960
 Wherever you have space, wherever you are, it's nice.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.960
 And of course, Buddha's teaching is not disturbing to anyone.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.960
 That is important.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960
 So when you raise of the brave likes,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.960
 then it will not disturb you.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960
 You will never hold on anyone.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.960
 Well, any place is true.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.960
 Raise of the brave likes is excellent, is beautiful.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.960
 But the best one is what in the teaching said.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.960
 High mountains, open areas.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.960
 There's a lot of wind movements and kind of clear areas, open places.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.960
 So raise of the brave likes is really the best in the teaching said.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.960
 It's uplifting the environment.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.960
 It's benefiting to the environment.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.960
 And same time, it's clear passage,

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.960
 and wind is like always the moment, the brave likes.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.960
 The brave likes, and that means it is that wind killing,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.960
 the energy of that brave like, to all of the universe of the world.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.960
 So therefore, high up in the mountain, or higher places, and raise up.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.960
 And that's what you, if you look in the Tibetan's house,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.960
 if you go to the Tibetan, or the Nepal, or the India,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.960
 there's most people, they put the brave likes up on the roof.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 Those families, they put, was a higher place.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.960
 So in that way, this little land is one of the best places to put the brave likes.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.960
 With that, with motivation, with intentions, if we put brave likes.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.960
 It's so spacious.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.960
 And the time of the brave likes, any time, again,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.960
 any time is excellent, there's nothing really particular in that.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.960
 But again, if you have a choice, the springtime, this time, is really the best.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.960
 Because everything is what the Buddha is teaching,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.960
 it's an interdependent coordination, coordination.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.960
 It's all connected.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.960
 So if you put right cause and condition and circumstances,

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.960
 that will all become more powerful.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.960
 The springtime is a time of lush, time of the growth,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.960
 time of the energies rising up.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.960
 So if we swing on that as like surfing board with the brave likes,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.960
 then our energy, vitality, good motivation, all will come up.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.960
 So this is also the time, this time, for example,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.960
 this during this memorial weekend, or this time,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.960
 it's really the best of the time.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.960
 Generally, as I said, any time is okay, definitely good.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960
 Good, in particular, also in the teaching,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.960
 I'm good anytime, but if you have no choice, good anytime.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.960
 But if you have choice, times are like, such as like,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.960
 generally time, in the Pacific time of the days,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.960
 then such as, at the day, tender day, full moon,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.960
 and the new moon, back in the day, those are really good,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960
 according to the teaching level.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.960
 And then springtime, as I said, is good.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.960
 Because it's lush, it's a growth, it's a progress,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.960
 that energy is coming in this bottom of the world, or not bottom of the world,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.960
 or only, not subsided, is really raising, kind of rushing that energy.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.960
 Energy, so every use is this.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.960
 So time is the perfect time of the putting it.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.960
 And the next one is then benefit of this.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.960
 Benefit of this practice, the brave likes, are the normals,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.960
 benefit of now and benefit of future.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.960
 Benefit of now is already mentioned,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 removing the obstacles, obscuring disease,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:35.960
 sicknesses, fulfilling our goal in raising up our vitality, the energies.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.960
 Energies, really, that is it.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.960
 And ultimate benefit is then, according to the teaching,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.960
 it will lead us to the enlightenment,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.960
 because we are accumulated to merits.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.960
 Merit, accumulation merit, what's remaining combined,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.960
 so we will go inside, or simple itself, we make good karma.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.960
 So karma, karma is not only just a benefit of this lifetime,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960
 but next lifetime, next lifetime, next lifetime.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960
 So that is what it is.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.960
 Then what are the brave likes, what are those prayers here?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.960
 We say brave likes, brave likes, there.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.960
 But it is not just, I mean, I don't know exactly the meaning of the brave,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.960
 but it is a sacred word, sacred syllables,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.960
 are printed there on those perfect, simple colors,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.960
 accorded elements, accorded wisdom, is printed there,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.960
 that we are raising up with perfect time, perfect location,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.960
 and perfect motivation for that.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.960
 So it's sacred words, sacred teachings.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.960
 Sacred words, meanwhile, accorded Buddhism,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.960
 it is absolutely best upon the voice of love,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.960
 and compassion, kindness, to all living without any discriminations.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.960
 It is simply a song.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.960
 It is all the teachings of the Buddha's teachings,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.960
 the teachings of the Sothar's teachings, Mahayana's Sothar's teachings,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 but regularly in and out of other teachings, in and out of other teachings.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.960
 There we are raising up.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.960
 We put it up as a perfect element,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.960
 and when you put it outside, it will be corrected by all the five elements,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.960
 sky, earth, fire, water, wind.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.960
 By regular wind, it will carry that fire.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.960
 And wind is the most powerful element among all the elements.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.960
 Everything is best accorded Buddhism.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.960
 It's wind, automatically, it's really standing on the wind.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.960
 We all stay.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.960
 The universe is standing on the wind,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.960
 and ourself is best on the wind, without physical situation.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.960
 So, it's branding to that everywhere, it's benefiting to everywhere.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960
 It's branding, the element is the balancing,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.960
 and at a larger level, the environment is balancing,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960
 and we can really do that.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.960
 Also, contributing is one of the best we can do

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.960
 for the environment, the contribution, to do such this reflex.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.960
 So, it benefits too many levels, multiple levels.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.960
 And so, that's my brief introduction of the reflex.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.960
 Thanks a little bit, I don't know too much, but thank you.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960
 Thank you, everyone.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.960
 Now, really, among all the duties that we do,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.960
 the practice of the wind, health, energy,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.960
 and the Kessai is the accorded teaching.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960
 It's the best, really one of them.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.960
 I mean, generally, all, but as enlightenment is the same,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960
 there's no difference between.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.960
 Everyone is in love and in compassion, kindness,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.960
 and Buddhism that embodies to all living beings.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.960
 There's no difference at all.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.960
 But however, even though there's no difference,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.960
 because due to their privilege, commitment,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.960
 and aspiration of the bodhicitta,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.960
 and then they slowly kind of highlight the performance

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.960
 or the act that is beneficial that comes to those

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.960
 who are connected to those duty of the Buddha.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.960
 For example, Mejichiri is known as the Buddha of the West.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.960
 Then he made the compassion, and the loving kind is not there.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.960
 And he says, "Oh, but there will be a highlight of the West."

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.960
 Keresi, our local hero, is without compassion.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 Again, it didn't mean Keresi don't have a mister.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960
 It's just a highlight.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.960
 Similarly, Kessai is known as the very spellable

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.960
 to raise up the wind force on energies,

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.960
 or the vitality, and remove obstacles.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.960
 So therefore, we're doing these Kessai practices combined.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960
 We're not talking.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.960
 Suppose we do Kessai practice a short time,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.960
 and then we do this break, Kessai,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.960
 and do the blessing of the brave flesh,

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.960
 and that's not just of me.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.960
 We all do this blessing, put our integral little motivation

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.960
 to this phrase, and put a blessing there,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.960
 and then we take that out, and you will have to raise up that.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.960
 And then again, as I said, when we raise up this brave flesh,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.960
 all prepared, and really have good motivation,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.960
 good intent, good thought, and thinking of every living being,

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.960
 and by doing this, we will put peace and happiness, harmonious,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.960
 to all this whole world.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.960
 I'm sure throughout the centuries,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.960
 these troubles were always there, but these days,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.960
 it looks like so many kinds of battling of these troubles everywhere,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.960
 really wish that everyone has a very great wisdom,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.960
 and knowledge, and understanding, and respect,

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.960
 and opportunity to everyone, to each other,

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.960
 and others, and they're very calm, and peace, and harmonious,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.960
 and that in those inhabitants of this world.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960
 And then in also the world itself,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.960
 also the whole element is completely perfectly balanced,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.960
 and so there's no natural disasters really come, and that,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.960
 and then we come right through that,

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.960
 everyone also become the highest ultimate goal of the joy,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960
 and peace, happiness, really wish in that.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.960
 So we do that to prepare those brave flesh,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.960
 and raise up this brave flesh, and as we can do,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.960
 and so that is the, so that's a brief introduction.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.960
 And now, we do this, again we do the Kesa practice here.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.960
 If you have this sadhana, and please open this sadhana, and we...
