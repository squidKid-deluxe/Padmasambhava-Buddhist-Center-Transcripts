00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 (Video)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 (Video)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.440
 Now that we can change, we can do these things in the 19th century, everything is blooming so good

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.510
 and this daveta is so big, so big and so good-looking, but when you eat, then you all know what is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 that. There's no really flavors. I'm not kidding, it's just only looking.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 And our organic tomatoes here or other places, it's just like fruit, so delicious. I'm not kidding,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.160
 the taste of that thing, even the flavors, then in the deal level, in the sales and all those

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.000
 things, then I'm a scientific nurse.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.120
 Now everyone is talking about organics. That means it's not something that organics, now we develop

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:51.630
 the modern time. Organics are coming back to the ancient style. Our ancestors were used. That's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 what they do.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.720
 And all the manuals, but it's ancient, that's what everyone is promoting, what's it called, compost

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.170
? Compost. I mean, it's just a basic, basic convenience, knowledge of the government. Everybody is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.000
 shining that now.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.620
 Now, they see these too many chains, too many things, what will lead. But of course, even though it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.000
 won't change, our human thought, ego-clinging and community attitude

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.180
 and distinctly the partisan kind of aero guns and all that, they will make so many stories, so many

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000
 things. And that's what so many of the commercials, everything talks so many things.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.940
 When they talk something, it looks like, wow, that is every answer. When we read those commercials

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.000
 or some books. But reality level, maybe truth isn't just 10%.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.550
 Maybe, I don't care, you know, you're all very smart cookies. Smart cookies and all the advances

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.000
 and the knowledge is started. I mean, you really do. It's not like ancient time to be.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 To be, many times, those people really started, except maybe those who are practicing, they don't

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.210
 know how to start it, but they don't. But here, everybody goes to school and knows it's just a sort

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.000
 of activated status.
