NOTE     "synopsis": "Enjoying watching the PBC Sangha gathered together to celebrate the arrival of Vajrayana Master & Nyingma Scholar, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche to Palden Sherab Pema Ling retreat center in Jupiter, Florida for the first day of the 2023 Dzogchen Winter Retreat!\n\nJanuary 14, 2023\n\n---\n\n\u201cEssential Dzogchen Teachings on the View, Meditation, and Conduct\u201d\nby the Great Master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 14 \u2013 21, 2023\n\nPBC Palden Sherab Pema Ling Retreat Center:\nLotus Land of Glorious Wisdom\n18190 131st Trail N\nJupiter, FL  33478\n\nEmpowerment of Guru Padmasambhava as Guru Vidyadhara (in person only)\nRevealed by the Great Terton Tsasum Lingpa\n(Sunday Morning, January 15 - In Person Only at Pema Ling in Jupiter, Florida)\n\nGuru Padmasambhava gave a variety of teachings to benefit future generations. Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",
