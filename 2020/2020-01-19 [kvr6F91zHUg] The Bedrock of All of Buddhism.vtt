00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 We provide with teachings. All those teachings are designed to benefit and to help or reward our

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 nature.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 To benefit in this life and benefit others with the context of kindness, compassion, love and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500
 kindness, respect and appreciation.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.530
 All that teaching, all teachings, and that teaching is practiced in meditating and activating the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.000
 realization through the three different ways.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.220
 Those are known as starving, contemplating, any meditation and practices, and so many great

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.150
 practices of the highest realization, same as the Buddha himself, one after another, in India, in

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.000
 Tibet.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.310
 And then Buddhism came into bed. In that century, full-blown Buddhism came. And not just the only

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.000
 academic or the books and all that, but realization also really brought so many people,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.160
 individually, got realization in bed in the eighth century. And we provide the greatest teacher, by

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.930
 Varpay Masambhavam, and great master Shindarachada, and great master Bamanmattara, and as well as

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 so many others, too.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.360
 Came, and so practiced many, many, many, so many great master, one after another, great

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.000
 practitioner there. That continued there, continued there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.030
 Now, what will we do? Practice, what is the essence of the practice in teaching? This is what,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.000
 again, I'm going to list. Those are the foundation of the practices.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 And whether we do the retreat, whether we do individual practices or during the retreat, or anytime

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.000
 we practice, this is really teaching so important.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.540
 I mean, we all have this. It's not something that we don't have. So what are those? Those are, if I

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.000
 listed that, first is 18 endowments.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 18 endowments. Or, yeah, 18 endowments. Second is devotion or the pain. And the third is, is, is,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.000
 what's called, joyful effort.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And fourth is, residents. And the fifth is, qualified teacher. And then, sixth is the practices.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.920
 Practice without obstacles, hindrance. Those are the six. There is a sixth group. They are like bad

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.000
 rocks of the practices.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And if you reflect that to each of those, we all have that. We have the 18 endowments.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.630
 We have the devotions or the pain. We have the joyful effort. We have the residents. We have the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.000
 qualified masters.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 We met so many great masters on our plannals. And then, we received the teachings. And also, we don

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.000
't have much obstacles in practicing.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.140
 So that we have that. So therefore, I mean, we all have the perfect conditions, cause and condition

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.000
 to the practices.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Now, the first we think,
