00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 We went here at age 22 according to this bed, the beginning of the bed, and we went and this

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 time the teachings, according to the point of view of Dzogchen teaching, all the schools

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.260
 and all the teachings are mentally related, practicing on the mind to mind, so it's mind.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.900
 It's called subduing the mind by the mind.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.060
 That means ego clinging is mind, like egoless, for example, egolessness taught is also mind,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:48.540
 so the mind will help to present the ego, taught, both are taught, but one taught is

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 more important than the other taught, so mind to the mind.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.200
 In the Muhyengar bhathantara teaching mentioned, that is subdued by the mind to the mind, subduing.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.740
 So all the Adhyana's teachings are mind to help by the mind to the mind.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.580
 All the Adhyana's teachings, that started from the foundation teachings of the Buddhism

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.300
 and all the way, and that also included here as the non-buddhist schools too.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.700
 All is connected with mind, mindly and making, trying to find the truth exactly as should

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 try to, and then use all the different interpretations, the different techniques, which is of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.820
 course

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.580
 really helping various supporters, but is just still according to the point of view of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.180
 the Adhyana teaching, particularly Dzokhi teaching, it is the letter delaying our total

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.660
 achievement and realization, it is in a way to be a kind of making some detours in its

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.340
 teachings, so it is detours.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.860
 And as we went yesterday, all one after another, another at a really kind of an essential point

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.180
 of view, and then yesterday we were in the mind-only schools.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.580
 Mind-only schools are generally Mahayana teaching.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.300
 Mahayana, sort of Mahayana teaching is known as in, according to the non-Adhyana level,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.580
 it is called bodhisattva yanas.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.100
 And bodhisattva, you all know, bodhisattva is the practitioners of the Mahayanas, but

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.180
 regularly who have the bodhisattva thought, love and kindness compare your thought for

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:43.380
 all living beings and activated that ceremony and called vows, take the vows with the bodhisattva

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 and then very determined to really prefer that vow by the practicing of the two accumulations

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.780
 of the six paramata practices, and that is the bodhisattva yanas, so courageous for enlightenment.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:10.300
 That has then, has two groups, in the two groups, those are known as mind-only schools

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.820
 and Mademaka schools, so we went yesterday, let me read about mind-only schools.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.140
 Mind-only schools, you say, philosophy, everything is come from created by the mind, our own

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.140
 mind.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.580
 That means each of all the experience, usage, everything is really the mind.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.420
 But there is a tree, even though it is the mind created by the mind, but there is a tree.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.060
 There is, for example, three habit patterns that we went yesterday.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.220
 Habit patterns of the universe, habit patterns of the consciousness and habit patterns of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.660
 them, one's own physical condition, those three habit patterns, we went there.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.980
 And what are the habit patterns of the universe?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.820
 Habit patterns of the universe and the teaching making is all the world, the universe world,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:28.340
 including five objects of them, five objects of the senses.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.420
 What are those?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:42.020
 Those are the poem, song, smell, trust, taste, and touch, those are the five objects of the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.020
 senses.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 And then what is the poem and the second habit pattern is developed by the, I think maybe

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.580
 I translated as subject, subject, and what is that?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.140
 Those are the ad consciousness, ad consciousness, all that.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.700
 And the target really then, good karma and bad karma.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:27.380
 Those are known as the habit patterns of the subject as I translated, nih, dong.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:36.300
 And then next one is the habit pattern of the poems, that each individually poems, our poems,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.220
 whatever the poems we have, human beings has human being poems, animal has animal poems,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.740
 all these different poems, whatever they have, poems.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.420
 And that is the habit pattern of the poem, triggered with their kind of limbs and soft

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:02.660
 limbs and all those are named as the habit pattern of the poems or the bodies, those are.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.380
 So that is developed.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.500
 However, this also, even though it is developed, when it is developed from the biggest, biggest

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.940
 times, there is no really time, even no time, it's just so long time it will develop because

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.140
 it become really, because of that, it becomes solid, solid.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.020
 The way that happened now is, oh, even though it is our mind, but it has become kind of

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.160
 like subject, our subject and object, it become very distant, distant.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.700
 Object is become, become as object and another thing, subject is a subject and another entity,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.780
 and they both become kind of like distant, as a definition.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:55.060
 Therefore, even though his mind is mentally developed, but this object is not as, like

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.380
 our really mind, this moment, it is the mind, developed by the mind, but it becomes as like

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.220
 separate entity in a way, because of due to the habit pattern.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.540
 What is mind is our perceived thought, whatever we think.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.080
 It has two things, when we look to the object.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.820
 It has the appearance of the object part and the appearance of the subject part.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.460
 The appearance of the subject part is mind.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.220
 And the appearance of the object part is not mind, because it is more connected with habit

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.260
 pattern in that extent, so it is not exactly mind, mind.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:47.860
 On her head, there is also some other Sangha members making that, that how come every day

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.320
 is a mind, for example, some days burning, burning house is taken in a fire, how we can

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.700
 say that is your mind, mind, it is true.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:06.500
 That what we see, that image is our mind, what perceiving is mind, but that burning house

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:17.480
 is object, it is not as house, even though according, mind only, it is developed, and

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.220
 developed that so big long time, but it is so distant because of habit pattern, so it

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.020
 is not, not that object is immediately mind.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:36.460
 And that, for example, when we die, we die, it is only dissolving our aspect of the perception

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:44.020
 of the subject, aspect of the perceiving things, not that we don't carry things, and not dissolve

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:51.460
 where the old object has gone, still the object is here, outside, exactly as it was, or at

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.700
 least on our perceiving status.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.100
 So those are the strengths that are named in the mind on the school, and the way they

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:07.060
 explain it is like three things, again, three things, by operating three things, I think

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:15.980
 many of you, maybe you read that, those books, books, and that is called nominated, nominated,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:26.220
 nomination, and is in twitter, that is very famous, kind of like system, brains, all everything

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.380
 in the mind only, so kumta is, I am translating, as nominations, and the giving is the, giving

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:39.500
 is the power of the others, others, of course I translate that, and the yundal is ultimately

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:48.100
 existing, so those are three, three things, and what is, nomination means, we are nominated

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.540
 by the duality, when things are arising, what things are reflecting to the ad consciousness

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:02.660
 or the mental stages, as arising, we nominated different names and labels, and identities,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:09.540
 and all that, that is called nominations, it is all, everything is a nomination, nomination

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.460
 is not something solid existing, it is really truly, but we made up that, our mind made

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:22.180
 up, and each different country has different names, different systems, and all that, that,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:30.260
 it is not something, comes with that object, yet it will be nominated, that is a nominations,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.620
 nomination, and that is just a roughly idea, I am just talking roughly, you can explore

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:41.660
 more, and then the other powers, what that means, other powers, that nomination is where

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:50.260
 this is reflecting, twitter, ad consciousness, that nomination, all that object, all those

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:56.600
 nominations, whatever that, whether it is a poem, song, smell, touch, whatever thought,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:04.060
 and conservative thought, all is reflected to the ad consciousness, so ad consciousness

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:12.020
 is, and what in the teaching said, other powers, followed by the other phenomenas, phenomenas

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:22.780
 things that, so is the other power, that is, then ultimately what, ultimately is the awareness,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:33.100
 the mind which is pre-pronged to dualities, that is the ultimate status, those are very

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:40.260
 famous philosophies of the mind-only school, mind-only school is in the many, many masters

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:47.740
 say really is so profound philosophy, and profound practices is very deep, and because

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:56.180
 it is taught by, also is a radio course, taught by the Buddha, the originality, but then re-stinted

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.180
,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:06.220
 by the, by the, or re-glorified and activated by the, by the, by the many great masters,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:16.120
 such as Vasubendus, Dharmakheti, Ajaya, Dengnas, I mean, all those famous, and also Asangas too,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.820
 many masters say that too, but anyway, it's really very famous schools, schools, and it

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:29.140
 is Mahayana and the Bodhisattva, developing Bodhisattva and practicing, practicing six

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:36.820
 paramata accumulated to merit, and purifying completely obscurations, removing for obscurations,

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.820
 and reaching enlightenment, and achieving the four Gaias and the three Gaias as the same

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.140
 as other schools, so that is, what is, is the only difference here, the, in their schools,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.460
 according to teaching, but in the book Lord and the masters always say that, it's different

00:12:53.460 --> 00:13:01.900
 is because they ultimately accept that there is existing, the subtle consciousness, that

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:12.140
 is the love, the best of everything, for that reason, mind only school, and the mind which

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.380
 is free from the duality, that is the only thing.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:26.380
 The next stage is, so here, so that is the next stage is the Mademaka, Mademaka, Eperhendry,
