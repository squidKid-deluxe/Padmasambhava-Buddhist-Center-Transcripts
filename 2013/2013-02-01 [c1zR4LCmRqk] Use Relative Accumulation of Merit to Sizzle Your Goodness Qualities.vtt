Here Khenpo Rinpoche emphasizes how important it is to face and use obstacles we experience in our lives, and to immediately do even the smallest act of goodness and avoid even the smallest negative action.\n\n\"In general, accumulating merit means boosting your immune system. You have to activate your spiritual immune system by increasing your energy according to the way the nature is. \"",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 "Yes, yesterday, we went through, it has again, if you're looking back to what we did yesterday,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 as the great King Kipadte Kherung Mooji and the great Master always said, 'It's good to look back

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.000
 at what you learned,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 what you read, what you understand, so that you can contemplate and then observe that into the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.000
 heart.'

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.700
 That's what the Buddha teaching always said. There's three things, studying, contemplating, and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 then practicing, meditating on this.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 The practice in meditating is the essence, but in order to do that, we have to observe the teaching

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.000
,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 not go through passing through. The teaching is not right. Observing that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.340
 What we do observe in the teaching, reflect that. Looking back to the teaching, read the teaching,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.000
 analyzing, contemplating,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.160
 and then read the essence of meaning and put that in action, known as practicing or meditating, as

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 we study.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 So therefore, looking back to what we discussed yesterday, we discussed the study,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 again teaching over the reference and bodhicapa, those meaning, essential meaning.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 We went different levels as this great sugary book explaining that. So we went through those things

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.000
.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.220
 And today, and then again, what are all that frame, what we put, again teaches for linear master's

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.000
 books.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 All this teaching can be, all this book that can be summarized into three.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 The preparation, the principal part of the practices, principal part of the practices, and the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.000
 concluding part of the practices.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The preparation part of the practices is linearly prayers, and as well as rafu and bodhicata,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.390
 and then preparing the areas where you're going to practice, or area, environment, kind of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.000
 preparing that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 so that everything suits and acceptable, is blended into our kind of situation, circumstances.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Those are all known as preparation.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Among them, that categories, we went through yesterday, rafu and bodhicata, rafu and bodhicata.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Today, we're going to talk the next step, which is you're going to look to the bed, bed 12, bed 12,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 accumulating the Mary through 10 branches. And again, this teaching is teaching of the inanthanthas

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.000
.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.920
 Entire this, this very sacred teaching, and it is teachings of the Mahayoga, essence teachings of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.000
 Mahayoga,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 essence teachings of the Anu-yoga, and essence teachings of the Mahārati.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 You and I did talk about these three inanthanthas teachings.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 So therefore, this accumulating the Mary is all also inanthanthas, zokimu,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 from the zokimu point, looking to the world and accumulating the Marys, and engaging in activity.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 You're standing firmly in the state of the zokim, other true natural states.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 From there, you are encompassing everything. That is what it is.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.080
 But however, again, we should do talk again, there will be basic general, what means accumulating

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.000
 the Mary.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Accumulating the Mary, generally means boosting up your immune systems.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's true. The immune systems.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The immune system is something that we all have.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 It's not something that we don't have. We have to activate it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 This is a spiritual Dharma immune system that you have to activate it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 That energy, then what it comes, energy is strong, good.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.480
 When you bring up the immune system, the energy of the spiritual, what are things? We need things

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.000
 that have to do.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Where things are appeared, where nature is, calling to us, where nature is.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 We are part of nature. It's not something that we are out of nature. We are part of nature.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.950
 We all train, polluted ourselves. We make pollutions. Of course, the pollutions outside, those are

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.000
 industrial material levels.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 But often, we pollute by unknowingly with our attitude, our mind, this duality mind.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.280
 Thinking we are doing something important, beautiful, special, but it turns out we completely blur

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.000
 our art.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Our environment, our system, our energy, and then we can decline instead of going out.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Therefore, we have to boost out, bring up the vitality of the good things.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Energy, this is known as day. Often, I'm sure many of you heard and know that.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 This is known as two accumulations. Accumulating the two things.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 What you are accumulating, you are gathering and building up the good immune systems of the energy.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Energy, and through two different techniques.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.700
 These two different techniques related with the external situation or our naturals, that is known

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.000
 as in the Buddha's teaching, relative truth.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Absolute truth, there is truth. Absolute truth and relative truth.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Relative truth means relative old, relative, what we perceive.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And by body, by speech, and by mind. All these are the relatives.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 In the form, sound, and space, these are all relatives.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 What are to boost up our energy systems, the immune system of the matter, the good things?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 What do we have to do? We have to do the good things.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 That's something that meet, match with our inner qualities.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.570
 Our inner quality of the natural mind is kindness, compassion, love, and worship, joy, and

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.000
 appreciation.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 That is our inner quality of the mind.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.420
 Ultimately, we do the activity, what we do. Because of the duality, because of pollution, we do

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.000
 contrary of the naturals.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Even there is reason to be joy, happy and appreciated, we don't really appreciate it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 We don't feel joy. We don't satisfy it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.650
 Because ego and duality is something to always greedy, hungry, and all the time, never has ended up

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.000
.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 And we turn down completely, wasted, and it diluted our system of the environment completely.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Therefore, now we have to build up, build up our environment externally, with good joy.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Joy, appreciation, love, kindness, compassion, and activate of that.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 That is in any sibling qualities of your heart and your mind.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.240
 But with joy and appreciation, respect, kindness, compassion, when began to reflect through the

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.000
 verbal and through physically,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 that is what brings up, boosts up the good quality, which is known as the Buddha teaching.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Accumulate in the merit, you are gathering, you are building up, you are building up the muscles.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Muscles, spiritual muscles. So we not become fragile, perishable at any moment.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.300
 We can stand in total, in fame, in a hurry, every situation of the Sun's Earth, activated, whatever

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.000
 is happening, external.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 We can stand. Read all those great Master's life stories, how they stand in total.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 They are not out of the samsara. You read all those books.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Even in the Buddha's sound, all those great Arathas.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 They are not out of the samsara, the environment.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.710
 They are standing firm, strong, and tall, and went through that and changed everything around the

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.000
 situation and circumstances.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.780
 That is known as the accumulating of the merits, good things, good activities of love, joy,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.000
 appreciation, as I said.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Those are all known as merit, merit activities.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.700
 And then related with every present activity, good things, such as in the Buddha teaching or the V

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.000
aidyana teaching,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Monroe practices, post-station, taking refuge, developing bodhicitta or expanding the bodhicitta.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.420
 Bodhicitta, mandala offerings, all those activities, such as generosity practices, morality

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.000
 practices, patient tolerance practices,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 combined with joy and love, everything blended in together.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 All those are known as the accumulating merit.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Something that we can walk, we can deal with verbally, mentally, and physically activities.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 That is known as the accumulating merit of the relative truth, relative love.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 This merit is so important. There is also beautiful stories.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.460
 For example, Buddha Shatyamuni, in the teaching, said three countless eons, he accumulated the true

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.000
 merit.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 He built up the true merit. That is why Buddha reached the enlightenment.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 He built up all that.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 This merit, that is what is so important and so special.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And this is just one of the stories.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Buddha taught ancient times. Again, these are the Buddha's teachings.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Ancient times, for example, even the smallest things.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 If it is right in crucial time, right moment, it bears the biggest fruit.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Good bears the fruit.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Again, same way, if it is a small activity, if it is a wrong moment, a wrong thing,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 then it again brings very big, bad results. I mean that, we all know that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 This is the ancient time, in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 ancient times, there came one time, there is drought. Drought came areas.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 All harvesters burned down, completely burned down.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And the poor person is not having enough food. There is a wealthy, wealthy, very wealthy family.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 There are six family members.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Family members, in the teaching said, two couples.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And two couples, father and mother.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 And then they have son and his wife, wife, couple, and they have one servant.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Also the servant is a wife, also a man and a female.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So there is six bears, man and woman, three women, three males.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 But this family is so wealthy, but however drought is so swift,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 they are so generous and giving to the others their food and health, time,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 and then also now many of them are already dying.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 And also they are going to die soon.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 But however, in the teaching said, they went through all their trade-off,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 when they saved the food, put compartments, or what's called, pantry.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 They went through all their pantries and tried to scrap,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 scrapping every grains, their food, and they got one hand full.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Or one of these four, so I think maybe, one of these four, got food, the grains.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 But now they have six family members.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Members, this is not going to end up, this is just the only one,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 sooner or later they are going to die, too.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So because at that moment, when they gathered that and hand for that,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 gathered that grain, at that moment, there is one right at the door,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 one sage came, asking for a sage.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And in the Buddha teaching, it's about bigger Buddhas,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 solitary enlightened beings, solitary enlightened beings.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 He came right in front of their doors, asking for it.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 They don't have anything to do, except them.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 The father told to the mother, "What do you think, sir?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Should I give to him this one?"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 But because anyway, this is not enough for us.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Us, if we say, and after that even we say this, we will die.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I mean, that will help us.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 But if we give that to one person, really it will make a difference.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 It will make help to that person, that individual.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So what do you think, shall I give?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 We shall give that to him.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 The wife said, "Yes, I agree with you, sir."

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And they asked their son and daughter, or son and daughter,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 the son's wife, they said the same thing.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 We shall give them.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Then they asked their servant, wife, and a servant, also a servant.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 They asked.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 They said the same thing, "We agree. I agree with every one of you, sir."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 So then they graciously offered that solitude sage.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And the moment they offered that solitude sage,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 we graciously, in the teaching, said,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 "This solitude is in life the biggest."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Immediately he started performing such extraordinary relaxation activities,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 known as marital activities.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 He performed.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 They are so moved by that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And same time what they did, what they prayed when they offered.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 I'm sorry, I'm not telling you that.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 When they prayed, what they prayed when they gave that solitude things,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 that solitude, this master, said,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 "By this offering, may there is no panic."

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 They really did that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 But same time they did this, this sage, all these activities,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 enlightenment activities, and they moved so much.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And the moment the power of that inspiration in the teaching said,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 "Power of that merit."

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Immediately their empty pantries are filled with food.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Filled with food.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Not just only that, immediately starts to raining.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Rain don't come down.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 So it began to prevent the drought and the payments to the whole world,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 or all that areas at that time.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And that is not just happening in the teaching.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Five hundred lifetimes, the experience result comes one after another.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 And that was also in the time of the Buddha Shakyamuni time,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 and he was born.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 These six family members are so full.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 In the teaching said, according to that teaching,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 they said, "Did the family come to the group?"

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 They said, "Life after life, they come to target us like that."

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 As the team came to target one after another.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And the Buddha Shakyamuni's lifetimes, they are known as the "look family."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Look up. Look up.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Can't think.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Look families.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Look families.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And the teaching said, "Wherever they look, by their eyes."

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Eyes.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 It brings abundance.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 It really brings abundance.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And then many disciples get kind of doubt why they can do that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And that's why the Buddha gave these stories.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 That's why they did such a significant generosity activity that time,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 and sacrifice in a way, their lives to do that.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Ever since for five hundred lifetimes, they've been experienced that.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And even this time, that's how they are in that.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So this is a result of the marriage stories.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 When we do the marriage activity.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And then similarly, there's...
