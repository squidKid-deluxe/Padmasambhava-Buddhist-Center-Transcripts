 "The practice of the Buddha teaching, to enlighten, to glorify, to bring out of the beautiful

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.400
 motivation, intentions, motivation of the joy and appreciations, and motivation of the kindness and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.330
 compassion for all living beings, which is known as bodhicata, and then motivation of the purity

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 understand of the Vajrayana teaching.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.320
 It's not just the Vajrayana teaching. At the reality level, everything is enlightening and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.130
 beautiful as pure and status, but due to our duality and the publication of the mind, we do not

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.600
 really behold that realization.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 Therefore, Vajrayana teachings are tools and teachings are waiting for us to discover the reality

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.360
 nature of the way things are.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.860
 Therefore, again, we strengthen all beautiful motivations. That's the way, the gateway, to discover

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.280
 the purity and the beauty of the nature.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.730
 And then also, as I said, we practice it not just only for ourselves, but for all living beings

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.440
 with our bodhicata.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.090
 See, we hear everyone, those who are live in the world, wherever, in the six vans, and those are

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.200
 gone on different sites, spaces where we frame this beautiful ceremony for everyone.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.570
 This ceremony is also, as you know, when you join this bridge, because this is your first time, if

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.360
 you go through, we go to India, so you will see.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.220
 This is not just only for ourselves, but this is to everyone. And plus, it is also practicing of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.560
 the healing, practicing of the removal, the obscurations, practicing of the prosperity,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.900
 the sacrifices, the purification of the naked witness, the disease, sicknesses, habit patterns, and

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.800
 practicing of creating beautiful circumstances and situations where beautiful things arise.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.560
 If you see, really, when you go through this, you will see this.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.320
 And generally, in the Buddha's teaching, I think it is coming by itself, coincidentally.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.880
 There is always cause and conditions behind the scenes, when things happen to us, we think, "Oh,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.560
 this is why this happened."

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.920
 But there is always cause and conditions behind the scenes, and that which is known as in the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.920
 Buddha's teaching, the interdependent four generations, all the Indian devotees you are in the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.760
 services.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.040
 This is all connected, and if we know how to do the right connection, the right circumstances, the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 right opportunity situation, things will come the right ways, beautifully and nicely.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 And who can do that? We can do. You can do, or we can do ourselves. Everyone has the capability to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.320
 change the direction, to do what we like to be seen.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.500
 And therefore, this practice is really motivating, we are activating, we are doing something

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.680
 beautiful through the teaching of the gracious kindness teacher of the Buddha Shakyamunas.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.400
 This is very specific, and then particularly the very end of teaching is so powerful, because he

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.880
 uses the skillful means.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 The skillful means, it looks like so simple, so kind of like this, but it makes a big impact to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.560
 change things, situations, create beautiful circumstances or interdependent, ordinary systems.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.270
 Therefore, again, this practice, you know, is all so beautiful from the beginning till the end,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.300
 every which we put forward, what we want, right in the presence of the gracious teacher of the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.880
 Buddha Shakyamunas, and of higher duties, and with beautiful motivation.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.430
 Start with beautiful motivation, and practice with beautiful motivation of the concentration, and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.960
 concluding this practice with beautiful motivation, and that must be beautiful.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.760
 Good from the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the ending, and that is good, I think, so,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.360
 I don't want to say, as long as we can deny and say it's not good, everything is good.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.290
 And therefore, this goodness we started, we started this not just for ourselves, as I said so many

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.490
 times, for all living beings, so really, please, respect your beautiful motivation and beautiful

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.040
 intention, and then we begin to practice it.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.950
 So, first, we do silent meditation for about five minutes, and then we begin our practices, and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.800
 thank you again, thank you very much, everyone coming, thank you.
