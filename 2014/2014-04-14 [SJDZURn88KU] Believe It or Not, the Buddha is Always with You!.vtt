Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche gave an inspiring teaching on how the buddha-nature - the true nature of our mind - is always with us no matter what, and that we'll never do anything to lose or change our perfect enlightened nature. It is always perfect, always with us, and the very source of all of our experience. Now we have to recognize and fully reveal our inherent beauty!",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 Then he said, "Listen, carefully listen." And 14 of them, 14 of them were sons and daughters,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 daughters or boys and girls.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 You heard so many times, this buddha, you heard so many times the buddha, it's kind of so renowned,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 so powerful, so spiritual, so important.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 And you heard, and also in both samsara and rana, it's kind of echoing that buddha everywhere. This

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.000
 big echo and hearing, so wonderful, so beautiful, that is, is, is, is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.860
 Where is that? Is it? Is it? And this is with you, is it? This is with you, that big one, that big,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.000
 big drum, that is, is not outside.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.330
 It's right with you, right with you, right with you, that big one. And the way he explained here,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:23.170
 the way he explained here, and again if you count this, there is seven wonders, seven wonders,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.000
 seven wonders.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.460
 The fourth one is, how wonderful. This buddha is with us. That big song, that big name, looks like

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 so fancy, so important, so difficult, so hard, hard to get.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.080
 Believe it or not, it's with you. This is with you. That's it. What's it called? There is a long

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.000
 time ago, there is a beautiful song called "Rip, When, Wonder".

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.720
 "Rip, Please, Believe It or Not". Believe it or not, "Rip, Please". Yeah, now I think it's gone,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.000
 that show is not here. But otherwise he says, "Believe it or not".

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.730
 The skin, when you watch, many times we find, always we find that, that, and this kind of way he

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 explained, also his mouth, and the skin which always jokes, his mouth, lips are kind of like, there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.000
 will be turning to believe it or not.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 It is so delicious. So this is what, this big buddha, big name, big fancy, difficulty, hard shape,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.000
 so kind of like power way, looks like so power way, and all this, believe it or not, is with you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 How wonderful it is. Or how shocking it is. How shocking, how wonderful. It's really, it's here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Right with you. Right with you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And the way it is there, it's not just with you, it's just with you all the time, yes, is it?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.740
 With all the time, never separated, even one instant. One instant is not separated. How really, how

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:16.000
, how amazing it is, how amazing, how shocking, how wonderful it is.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 It is all the time. And then even though it is with us, with me, with you, with everyone, it's this

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.000
, it's not also here said, it's to everyone, everyone.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.030
 All the beings over six realms, they all have the same nature, never separate, no matter what they

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.000
 are going through, or what we are going through, through up and down and all these things.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.480
 It's never separate, separate. Everyone has this, this. All the beings over six realms. All the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 beings of the head realm have this. All the beings of the hungry ghost realm have this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.360
 All the beings of the animal realm have this. And all the beings of the human beings have this. And

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.000
 all the beings of the asura have this. And all the beings of the gods have that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.100
 Everyone has this. Not just a head that, they have no even slightly difference that. Everyone is

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.000
 equal. Completely it's like democrats, democrats. Everyone is equal.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.630
 There is nothing is slight, even divisions up and down that call it, that nature. Everyone is

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.000
 perfect, beautiful. What is that then?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.470
 As I said before, that growth, that self-born awareness, that in boring world of three kyas, dharm

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:08.920
akaya, samokaya, namakaya, that all that is, that powerful nickel, that powerful item or atoms of

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.000
 the nickel, that is, is here, right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.050
 Then everyone has that. That. And how beautiful it is. And now the next one is, even though it is v

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:34.000
idas, how the beings of the six realms are acting, acting, they are completely lost it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.650
 Lost it, they are helpless, they are supportless, kind of, they completely lost it. And completely

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.000
 looks like they have power and status, poor, pathetic, and very feeble, and all of that.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.360
 That, because they didn't recognize, nobody recognized. This is what used to make great masters. It

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.000
's the same one, same as, as like those all properties.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.070
 All properties, I mean there is one part, one payment for example, one payment has such big gold, n

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.000
ugget gold under their ground, under their house, ground of their house.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:26.750
 But they are so poor, they are so poor of the clothes, poor of the food, and everything. And they

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.000
 don't know, they have that gold.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.920
 Gold is not telling I'm here, nor they are knowing that gold is there. That's what they experience.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.830
 If they knew that, if they walk onto that natural, they are not going to be as that power, power

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.000
 and status.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.730
 But we sentient beings always are looking somewhere, looking somewhere, completely ignoring our

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.000
 treasure, our nature, our beauty, beauty.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.750
 And they are looking somewhere else, all the time. They are looking somewhere else. Not just the

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:16.000
 Buddha, that's the habit of the sentient beings. Always looking, searching, searching something.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.190
 And also, that means also, hardly sometimes we appreciate ourselves. We are being great for

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.000
 ourselves. For example, we are looking somewhere else.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 That's what also, in American history, they are always on the other side, the garden looks greener.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 That's the way. Even your garden is good, even beautiful, they are always looking somewhere.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.630
 They are looking somewhere else, really power, with greedy, with miserly, with the color of the

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:55.000
 most common, like a coverture.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.820
 They are covertures, covertures, looking, searching. This is what is called ego-cling. Ego-cling is

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.000
 always hunger. Hunger is hunger.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.360
 Nature is hanging, not enough. Not enough. That's how it is. Even we are the richest beings, the

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:20.330
 richest in every aspect, still looking, searching, and struggling, and fighting, cruelly, to get

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.000
 more.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 That's how it is. Ego is. Ego has so many things to hunger, looking, searching.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 In the same way, absolutely, as a hunger point level, also we are looking for the outside. For the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 outside.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.800
 How strange it is. Again, how broken it is. How strange it is, looking outside. Even it is right

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.000
 with you.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.460
 The day one, until now. From the wiggliest time that we wandered, wiggliest times of lives, we

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.230
 wandered, all those different ups and don'ts and samsara and all that, went through all the birth

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.000
 and death and the cold, negating, sicknesses, and went through.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.010
 It's never separated. It's here, but we are looking always somewhere outside. That is the state.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.000
 That is how strange it is.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.630
 And then our next one is the wonders. Next one, or next we locate, or next it is how strange it is,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.000
 or now believe it or not, next one.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 It's there, which is, I think, three. Three of those wonders. Three wonders.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 This nature is, the self-born awareness is. Nature of the self-born awareness is what? Clarity is

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 refined, clear, is essence, is brilliant as the sun.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.560
 It's like that, that God. It's clear, brilliant, refined, very refined. It's like sun. It's shining

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.000
.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.230
 Because of that, of every, our intelligence, for example, our wisdom, our intelligence, our

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:13.000
 knowledge is the beams of light from that, this, this intelligence, from this self-born awareness.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.460
 Self-born awareness is like sun and is radiant. Even the dark and thickest of the mist and the cold

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:28.000
ness is shining up, which is guiding us, or which is guiding to every living beings.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.100
 The intelligence, always simple ways, the surviving intelligence we have. This is the light of this

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:42.000
, this self-born awareness. Light is shining from that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.610
 And then, if we go more detailed, then all, every intelligence aspect, according to Buddha teaching

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:55.890
, three wisdoms. Starting wisdom, contemplation wisdoms, meditation wisdoms, all wisdoms that

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:01.720
 understand all the relative truths, wisdoms that understand all the absolute truth, wisdoms that

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.000
 understand both equally, with all the self-realization.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.450
 All that is coming from this. And then, if we go higher level, all those five wisdoms is the shine.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:20.160
 This is brilliant light that coming from that, from our heart center or from this self-born

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:31.000
 awareness, which is always shining, rising, always brilliant, brilliant.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.810
 But people still didn't recognize. Recognize, or even they recognized, they made all different d

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:45.000
harmas, different kind of like dharmas and different exaggerations and kind of blowed up, blowed up.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Nature, how strange it is, that is how this goddess is.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:11.740
 Next one is then, again, the next, the fourth, the fourth wonders, wonders. This nature, the self-

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.000
born awareness, again, self-born awareness is, as I said, is grown, grown.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.460
 It is our best, it is our foundation. This self-born awareness, whether we use terminology grown,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:34.040
 whether we use terminology self-born, or whether we use terminology as self-born awareness, or

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.000
 whether we use Dharma data, or whether we use the absolute body data,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:49.910
 this is, is, is beyond of the death and birth, beyond of the death and birth. It is not temporarily

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.000
 arrived. It is built from the beginning.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.740
 Nature is built from the beginning, and nature is uncompounded. Nature is inconceivable. Nature is

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:12.590
 not fabricated by anyone. Therefore, this nature is never born. Never take birth at the first place

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.000
.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.460
 It is never, and therefore, it is never going to, it is dying, dying. So therefore, it is beyond of

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.000
 death and birth. Again, this nature, what does it mean?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.250
 It means self-born awareness, the inherited nature. All here, as the kyapa, you determine the

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:41.280
 metaphor as brilliant sunlight. This brilliant sunlight is never being born at first places, and

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.000
 never going to die.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.780
 Die, or believe. Birth and death is an ocean of the duality, or an ocean of the, of these systems,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.000
 what we go through. It's a display.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:08.830
 Therefore, it's never, for that reason, the self-born awareness is how wonderful, how amazing, how

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:18.010
 shocking it is. Or believe it or not, it's never, it's beyond of the death and birth. That is what

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.000
 this nature is.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.560
 this. Then, next one.
