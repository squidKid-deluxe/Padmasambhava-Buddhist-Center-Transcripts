Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540
 divided as foundation Buddhist schools and then Mahayana Buddhist schools and the Vayayana Buddhist

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.000
 schools.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 This is the essential practices of the Mahayana and Vayayana as two Vayayana.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.600
 So this is the practice, essential practice of the both practices that this is, that really

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.000
 essential part of it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And then Mahayana of course is a very popular terminology, you all know that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 But there is also mention, there is a seven wide Mahayana is called Mahayana.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 There is seven different, can't relate, seven different points, max Mahayana as Mahayana.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 I will list those seven and then we go a little bit over these, each of those.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And that is taught by the great master or the future Buddha.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 Materia, Materia that was coming, that next Buddha and picked Buddha. And his teaching is called S

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.000
uttara-alaykara,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 on the mantle of the Suttaras. And that teaching he said, and why is called Mahayana?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Because there will, again will, there will, or focal point.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 The focal point is big, the focal point is big, or will is big.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Second, I will list and then I go a little bit over there.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Second is, their achievement or their activity is big, their activity is big.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And then third is, their wisdom is big, or the knowledge is big.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And the next one is, their endeavor, commitment is big.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And their, the skillful means is big. And next one is, their achievement is big.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And their, their beneficial activity is big. Now what happened? How many?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Is that all good? So don't have to be.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.330
 So now, fortunately their will is big, means that the Mahayana bodhisattva practitioner's will has

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.000
 no boundaries.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Their purpose has no boundaries. Perclusive as dharmadhatu, space of dharmadhatu, every direction

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 there is no,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 I mean, no really limitations, boundaries, boundaries, pervasive.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And therefore, and then the Peruvian bodhisattva is full, it's not, it's limited.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Limited. So therefore, it's called, it's big view of big focal points.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Second is, and then second is, their achievement or the fulfillment is big, big.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Because that during the process of the bodhisattva or the bodhisattva, they made it in the practice

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.000
,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 they are fulfilling and they are working for benefit to one's own self and as well as all beings.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And others are more on the front than yourself.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.500
 Basic bodhisattva school or traditional bodhisattva school, not so purposeful of the old beings and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.000
 more individual,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 personally purposeful. Therefore, their kind of fulfillment or their projection is, is big.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And the third one is, the wisdom is big. And this time, this bodhisattva, the Mahayana,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.110
 the wisdom, is the wisdom of the understanding of the emptiness, emptiness of the true egolessiness

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.000
 status.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Many times I saw also, for those scholars last night, these two egolessiness are identities,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 three identities, personal identities and phenomena identities. So both are empty.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And Mahayana, in the basic bodhisattva school, fundamental bodhisattva school,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 more purposeful, personal identity as emptiness, emptiness.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 So therefore, their, their wisdom is different, different.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.100
 And their joyful effort or the indial is also big because these bodhisattvas are not major to help

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.000
 all the beings,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 beings by the durations, by areas and by times.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.150
 Until they reach enlightenment, they have no hundred, like, boring or no tired or no timidly, but

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.000
 continually carry that courage and commitment.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.720
 Many old beings put countless emails. And the foundation of the bodhisattva school is not their own

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.000
.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.390
 And the core of the teaching is until they reach in, like, Arhata books, which is, often some of

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.000
 the teachings said,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.320
 to reach seven large times, or depend, but whatever. And those great Arhata during the Buddha, for

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.000
 example,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.320
 Buddha, Shari Buddha, Mongol Buddha, Mahakashyapa, and all these great, these circles reach

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.000
 enlightenment

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 within that lifetime, not just the lifetime, but instantly when they revolve or see the Buddha

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 and it is these simple teachings and they fully wake it up, completely wake up.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.370
 So it's so fast. That could be in the past, they're cognitively, they're bored, and then just a

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.000
 powerful teacher

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.540
 and they're kind of recoverable at it, they're radiant at the time, and instantly they've got Arh

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.000
ata books.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 So that's it, they go.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And, then, this next one is Skirvamid. Skirvamid is, Skirvamid is the bodhisattva practitioner,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.410
 they're not deciding or wanting something, "Oh, I like to leave Samsara. Oh, I like to be in the d

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.000
harvana."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And so it's not something they desire. As long as they need it, they will stay.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And therefore, it is beyond Samsara, beyond the dharvana. Bodhisattva practitioner, all the Buddha

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 is beyond Samsara,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 beyond the dharvana. Nirvana residing, residing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And then, next one is the activities, great activities.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.770
 Buddhas benefit in order to get enlightenment to get involved in Mahayana, get enlightenment in

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.000
 order to benefit and help with sentient beings.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.370
 So all, therefore, Buddhas, those enlightened beings, remain as long as Samsara is free and

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.000
 benefited for all beings.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.600
 That, where they're helping is, what the teaching says, pervasive, continuation, and sub-continuous

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.000
.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Three different qualities are helping to all the sentient beings, the sub-continuous.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 That means no effort, no effort. Post-fold have to do, sub-continuous.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And also that their activity, beneficial activity, is not divided by the time and areas.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 The pervasive, every direction, Buddha, wherever they need it, wherever is ready,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Buddha's enlightenment, beneficial activity is reaching to every direction.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.320
 Then, it's not just for a short time, or one year, two years, or one year, it's forever,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.000
 continually, forever, until each making enlightenment.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 So those are, the reason is called Mahayana.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And then, of course, you all know Mahayana. Maha is the big, and yana means the weakness.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 It's a vehicle that was lifting, it lifted up so many beings to part of enlightenment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So this is what we're going to explain in coming, that is, essence of that Mahayana, the path.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And then path, with that attitude, with that understanding, path is, then, of course, you all know.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:43.370
 Here it is, five paths, accumulation path, application path, seeing path, and meditation path, and

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.000
 normal starting path.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Those are known as the five paths.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 The accumulation path is at the beginning stage, beginning stage, something.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.700
 The quality of the accumulation path is their courage, their commitment, their willingness, their

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.000
 devotion to dharma is uncheckable.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.570
 When you have that uncheckable, you continue to practice, meditate, follow the instruction, then

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.000
 you may be,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.500
 then maybe, I'm not going to say you, maybe we are beginning to the beginning of the accumulation

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.000
 path, accumulation path.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.740
 And the starting, learning, learning, learning, and for example, starting from the great meaning of

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.000
 the absolute truth, such as,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.130
 so, kind of get that bit and aspire and practice very diligently with joy and really, like,

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.000
 continually, like, practice.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.860
 That stage, and perform it also accumulation practice, like, meditation practices, happy to the

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.000
 other beings,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.630
 supported to the community with good heart, with bodhicata, as I'm saying, good heart, but bodhic

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.000
ata, bodhicata,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 really helping support your capability and also practicing and helping.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 So, in activating your own capabilities by meditation practice and in outreaching that practice

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 meditation,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 happy to the others as much as you can.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:27.750
 According your capabilities and according the readiness of others, honest with the gentle, peaceful

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.000
, soothing, no clashes, no clashes.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Something simple that, really, that's the way in the teaching series. So that's great.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 But good heart, your courage in commitment, always the everlasting growing strong status, status,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 that's what it is.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 That is kind of the beginning of the application, the accumulation part.
