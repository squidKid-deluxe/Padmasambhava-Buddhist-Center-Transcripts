00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.510
 Again, thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, everyone. Again, thank

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.140
 you so much, everyone.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:17.070
 And again, I just want to thank everyone and members of the Vemasanbha Buddhist Center in Southern

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 Florida,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 and as well as all the friends of the Vemasanbha Buddhist Center and the Dharma practices every

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.680
 month,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:32.320
 to really activate this event and organize it. I'm so grateful and thankful and happy,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.960
 and we all want our hearts to be in this beautiful place. Again, with you all, and with the great

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.820
 discussing of the Dharma,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 according to my capability, and so thank you for this opportunity. Thank you, everyone. Thank you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.920
 very much.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.490
 This morning, then I'm going to talk about generally three yaanas. And those are known as the "Ker

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.140
abhara,"

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.720
 or the "Kundalika of Buddhism," "Sappara Mahayana," and the "Vedayana of Buddhism."

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.280
 Those are some of the top of this I thought I would talk over. That was the asking to discuss,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.880
 so I'm happy to talk about these things. So today what I'm going to do, I will talk about those

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.000
 three yaanas.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 I will be struggling with that. Then, as I talk about three yaanas, maybe about an hour, an hour,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.320
 or about two hours,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.620
 I will talk about those. And then we have some questions and answers. Answers, we have short break,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.400
 and after that, then come back, again, I will continue to talk. And then after I talk at the end

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 and the final,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.880
 I will discuss a little bit about the practicing of the Dharma. And even though you already know

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.760
 and practice it,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.420
 but I would just like to, again, just highlight it and remind it to all of us how we do practices.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.120
 And the reason I'm talking about this, because generally in Buddhism, there are three ways that you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.320
 learn about the teachings.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.440
 Those are known as the "studying," "contrapletting," and the "practicing," or the "meditating."

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.080
 So the first I'm going to talk about these three yaanas in a way, like kind of starting and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.260
 contemplating.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.540
 And then at the end, I talk a little bit about the practice, or the meditation, or the practice of

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.960
 the day.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.640
 So those are my kind of like frame or the schedule, or what I will try to do there.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 So now I will talk about the three yaanas. As a Inavadhyana Buddhism, in particular the Inma

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 Buddhism,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.740
 what the Inma Buddhism is mainly a high-light practice, focus on the practicing on the Vedayana

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.240
 Buddhism.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.400
 That is what the Inma schools of the Devadhyana Buddhism does.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.340
 So generally, I think only the Devadhyana Buddhism is really the highlight of the Vedayana Buddhism

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.640
.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.820
 But particularly also in Inma is that we call in many, there's four Buddhist schools, principal

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.240
 Buddhist schools, there are many soft schools too.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:16.040
 But those four schools are the Inma, Kaju, Satya, and Garo schools.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.640
 So we belong, so our belongs, we belong, of the Inma schools of the Devadhyana Buddhism.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.150
 In the Inma schools of the Veday Buddhism also highlight the Vedayana Buddhism, the practice of the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.640
 Vedayana Buddhism.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.290
 Vedayana Buddhism is translated into the Inna, I think, diamond wickers, diamond yanas, diamond

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 like yanas.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.730
 Oh, yana, diamond, ready is the diamond, and the yana is translated into the Inna, I think wickers,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.040
 wickers, so diamond wickers practices.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.940
 Diamond wickers practices, even though they focus on the Vedayana Buddhism, but they practice all

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.840
 the Buddhism.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:09.640
 There is no Vedayana Buddhism without the condition Buddhism and the Satyamahayana Buddhism.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.840
 And they're all really connected, and the Vedayana practices all Buddhism.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.440
 What does that mean? That means the gracious teacher, Buddha Shatya Muni, reached enlightenment at

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.640
 35.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.040
 And then his life spans according to his story about 81.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.240
 So over 45 years, the Buddha gave the teachings.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.730
 And all those teachings are divided by a second symbol which will create these vikas, yana

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.240
 teachings.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 Punditian Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Vedayana Buddhism. That's all Buddha taught.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:06.110
 What is the Buddha's teaching? The teaching of the Buddha is teaching on the nature, nature of the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.240
 subject, nature of the object, nothing but, that's it, nature.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 Exactly where things are, but it does not give any mysteries or kind of anything there.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:28.540
 Nature is who shares that nature, who are and within the nature. We all, every living being are

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.240
 equally within that nature.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.240
 There's nothing else. It's a selected group use the nature, and we don't even know.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.240
 Everyone is. Nature is equal to every living being.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.890
 For example, sun, and moon, and stars, and the air, and the earth, and the water, fire, all the

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.240
 space, and all is shaped by everyone.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 It's nothing really selected groups or anything.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.240
 Similarly, what Buddha taught, nature is shaped by everyone. We're within that.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.130
 And Buddha also, we have always a lot of difficult troubles in the samsara. We are going through so

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.240
 many difficult troubles.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.760
 Even though there is good things, good times, and nice times, but yet, we are completely kind of

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.240
 like, like, saturated with a lot of troubles, a lot of difficulties.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 Going one after another. Why we are going through these troubles and difficulties?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 Because not knowing the nature, or not recognizing one's own nature, and nature everything.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.640
 Then we are kind of struggling, really, our desire and the way things are happening is not just

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.240
 coming together.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 We are struggling because of not really using wisely, or applying, and mingling with the natures.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.240
 That is the problem, problematics, according to Buddhism. That is stunning.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.240
 This is the trouble when we don't use nature.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:20.530
 Whenever we use nature, and be in nature, a part of nature with the recognizations, then we're more

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.240
 calm and peaceful, more open, and more relaxed.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 That's what the gracious teacher, Buddha, called.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.750
 So for that reason, Buddha said, "He's nothing but a teacher. He's just really showing things, what

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.240
 things are, how things are happening.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.240
 He's nothing, any mystery, people, or anything."

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:49.390
 Buddha himself, highly and clearly announced, and so many times, he is just a simple teacher,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.240
 showing the way things are, exactly.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.240
 The way things are, both subject and object. That's about it.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:06.350
 Now when we talk with that understanding, that means all these three yanas, basic Buddhist, Pundit

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.240
ian Buddhist school,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.240
 Nusopram Mahayana school, and Vajrayana teaching, all is nothing but is nature.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.240
 It's exactly nature, where things are.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.250
 And again, as I said, nature is shared by everyone. There is nothing in any selected groups or

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.240
 anything.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.240
 So if we say, "One now, when would I give those three dana teachings?"

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.240
 How that happened, all those three different levels of teachings.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.750
 All the teachings are happened, and when he gave the teacher, when he reached the enlightenment age

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.240
 35,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:59.240
 around age 42, he gave principally high teachings on the Punditian Buddhism.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:12.060
 Around age 43 to the age 72, he gave the teachings on, so mainly, highlight, mainly Sauta Mahayana

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.240
 teachings.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:24.240
 Around age 73, until age 81 or 80, he gave highlight teachings of the Vajrayana teachings.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.240
 Or that just kind of a very gross level to explain.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.730
 It didn't mean that he did not give any other teachings, kind of completely struggling, divided

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:35.240
 that one up.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.240
 That didn't mean that. He just highlighted it.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.240
 So now the positive teaching. What is positive teaching?

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:53.240
 Positive teaching is teaching mainly under conduct, varieties, conduct or ethics.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.240
 Again, that did not mean he did not give any other teachings.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:05.240
 Vajrayana Buddhism, Buddhist teaching, often used for three principal practices.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:14.240
 Three principal practices, sometimes used three extraordinary training practices.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.240
 And what are those? Those are known as the morality practices, concentration practices,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.240
 and as well as wisdom practices.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.240
 Those three are the principal, heart of the entire Buddhism.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:40.240
 It doesn't matter if you are from the Punditian Buddhism school or Sauta Mahayana school

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:49.620
 or the Vajrayana Buddhism, that these three are the heart, essence, frame, identity, nature of the

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.240
 teaching.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.240
 Entire teachings. So post-Buddha highlight of the morality teachings.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.050
 And morality teaching is also when you Buddha highlight, it didn't mean that there is no

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.240
 concentration,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.240
 there is no wisdom practice. It didn't mean that.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.240
 In the teaching, what are they saying?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.240
 The morality of the concentration, morality of the morality practice, teachings,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:23.240
 moralities of the concentration practices, moralities of the wisdom practices, practices.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.240
 This is all connected. And these teachings are what are known as, also in Buddhism.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:39.240
 Buddhism, many of you know of course, three pitakas or three pitakas or three basket teachings.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.240
 Three basket teachings are what are those, a prove you don't know.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:53.240
 Those three basket teachings are known as Vinaya teaching, Sautara teaching, Abhidharma teaching.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.240
 Vinaya, all this has to do with and what made Vinaya discipline teaching,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:09.240
 teachings on the disciplines, all these teachings on the calm and peaceful teachings.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.240
 And then Sautara teaching, condensed teachings, more condensed teachings.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:23.240
 What does that mean? All principles which get concentrated, concentrated, not skated,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:32.540
 not kind of like, kind of like all skated, all over, is all gathered, all concentrated,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.240
 concentrated.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.240
 What is Abhidharma? Abhidharma is Sanskrit word again.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.240
 Abhi means actualizing, openness.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.240
 Dhamma means phenomena, Abhidharma.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 So actualizing with all the phenomena are, actualizing, all discovering with all the phenomena.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:11.260
 Dhamma is a generally Sanskrit word, it goes or uses the Sanskrit language about ten different

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.240
 meanings.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 But this time, it means phenomena.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:25.790
 Seeing everything, again if I translate it in another way, seeing exactly where all the phenomena

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.240
 are.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.240
 That means nothing high stated and nothing lower stated.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.240
 Or sometimes I used to say, "Exaggerate it and deprecate it," if you know what that means.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.240
 Somebody told me they don't know what that means.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 So then I'm stopping that statement all the time.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.240
 But I heard that before somebody told me, that's what means.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:58.240
 Highly stated, far from the way things are.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.240
 And also kind of low-stated, state of very low and far from the way things are.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.240
 So exaggerated and deprecated, those are mentioned.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.240
 But anyway, highly stated. So where is that in things are?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.240
 That's the Abhidharma teachings.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.240
 So then what these three are, always in the teachings, again those are what I said to you.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.240
 There will be more kind of explanation there.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.240
 But if you kind of a more simple way to tell.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:33.240
 Sutra teaching is the teachings mainly on the morality and so on.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.240
 Vinaya teaching is mainly on the morality teachings.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.240
 Sutra teaching is mainly on the concentration.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240
 And Abhidharma is mainly on the resistance.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:51.240
 Vinaya says that again the same technique applied as I said earlier.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.240
 This morality teaching also has three.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.240
 Vinaya teaching has three meanings.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.240
 Vinaya of the discipline teaching, Vinaya teachings of the concentration of teaching,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.240
 and Vinaya of the wisdom teachings.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.240
 And Sutra teaching has also that three.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.240
 Sutra teaching of the discipline teaching, Sutra that has concentrated teaching,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.240
 Sutra that has wisdom teachings.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.240
 And Abhidharma has also the same thing.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.240
 Abhidharma teaching that has discipline teaching,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:36.240
 Abhidharma that has concentrated teaching, Abhidharma that has wisdom teachings.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.240
 So that is really the half form. That's what I call three pita kas.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.240
 Or three basket. Three basket is not just three individually basket.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.240
 It's a metaphor. It means it has like so many kind of like contains.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.240
 It has, it's like a tray box. You open one tray, your box, there is another tray.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.240
 There is another tray. There is another tray.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.240
 It's like Christmas gift package that you open.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 Those are great, great parents. Great, great parents.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.240
 They put so many things together to give the surprise to their loved ones.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.240
 Same way here. But the presenters. So beautiful tray box.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.240
 All this exterior nature.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.240
 This is nothing, anything but nature.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.930
 This is not just kind of electrocuted or saturated or is unnatural. It's all really simple nature.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.240
 Exactly.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.240
 Exactly. That is what really this pita kavas teaches.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.240
 Now we will talk about this again.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.240
 The first yana, kundreja yanas.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.240
 Kundreja yanas is sometimes one name.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.240
 I'm not sometimes in Buddhism name.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240
 Hindu yana teachings. Hindu yana.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.240
 But I'm using terminology as foundations.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.240
 Hindu yana, what is the terminology we use?

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:07.240
 Hindu yana, foundation, first Buddhist school, it is the foundation.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.240
 Foundation of what?

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.240
 It's the foundation of the sattva Mahayana.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.240
 It's the foundation of the vediyana Mahayana.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:25.240
 Without the hinyana or the foundation Buddhist school, Mahayana is not completed.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.240
 Vediyana is not completed.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:37.710
 And so therefore it is completely, those true are, are completely best up from this foundation

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.240
 Buddhism or hinyana schools.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.240
 Hinyana. Hinyana is Sanskrit word again. What that means?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.240
 Small, weaker.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.240
 Hiny is small. Sometimes translated low.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.240
 Sometimes translated as beginning.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.240
 So beginning weaker.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.240
 Beginning weaker.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.240
 And that means it's just a foundation to start it, to start it.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:15.240
 Your journey of discovery of the nature's beauty.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.240
 We're natures, subject in object, ethics.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.240
 Sometimes we're interpreting kind of, sometimes the hinyana is low, weaker.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.240
 Something that Mahayana practice, Vediyana practice, should not apply.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.240
 It's not something completed. That is a must text.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.240
 According in Mahayana Buddhism, all the Vediyana Buddhism is a very complete must text.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.240
 We know that, we know the foundation Buddhism or the hinyana Buddhism.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.240
 We are completely incomplete, incomplete.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:57.240
 Now we talk about the foundation Buddhist schools.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.240
 The foundation Buddhist schools, when we explain about the foundation schools,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:11.240
 it has the, again, the conduct, concentration, and wisdom practices.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.240
 Conduct of the general practices is what in the teaching says.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.240
 Discipline.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:31.240
 Within our activities, our self is not disciplined or not gentle, not peaceful, not calm.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.240
 Because due to the emotions, negative emotions.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.240
 Negative emotions are not natural.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.240
 Natural, it is known as unnatural.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.240
 Who created these negative emotions? Nothing, but one's own self.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.240
 Where did negative emotions start? From our own mind.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:06.240
 Mind of the, in the teaching said, unknowing.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:21.240
 Unknowing. What that is unknowing? Rasping, clinging. Rasping and clinging of the one's own self.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:28.240
 That which is obtained in the Buddha teaching, named ego-clinging.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:37.240
 Clinging to our self. That is my self, I and my.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 That clinging is, according to Buddha's teaching, is not natural.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.240
 That clinging. Why is it not natural?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:55.240
 When you look, trying to find what we cling in, there's really nothing to find.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:03.240
 There's nothing to find. No matter whatever technology we use, more in time, or ancient time,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:14.900
 use all the intelligence, discrimination, awareness of Muslims, analyzing, investigating, going

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.240
 thoroughly.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:24.240
 What we cling to is really existing here. For example, such as I.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:33.240
 I is the big notion, so important for us. There's nothing more important than I.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:46.240
 We cling. And all those clingings of I, then comes mind. All mind. Mind. Mind. Mind.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.240
 And then when we come to mind, there is acceptance, there is rejection.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:01.010
 Acceptance of something that you can't desire, that, oh, it's mind, it's something important for me

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.240
.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.240
 And then also rejection, something that comes, oh, I don't like that. It's not mind.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.240
 I don't like, I hate. I'm that kind of rejection and acceptance.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.240
 That is challenging. Challengings.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:24.240
 So now, when we are talking about this important of our eyes, that such is important,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.240
 and the kind of suffering is important, and where is that I?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.240
 And then there's nothing really existing.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.240
 But true to this I, then all the emotions are erupting.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.240
 All kind of things are coming, and such as important things to accept

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:53.240
 and rejection, or like to avoid the things, and then our activities become wired.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.240
 Undersplend. Activity become undersplendent.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.240
 Those are in a Buddha teaching named negative activities.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:09.240
 And particularly in this Canadian Buddhist school,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:18.240
 they are trying to avoid the negative activities of those undersplendent activities.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.240
 Immediately checking care of them. Immediately deal with them.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:30.620
 And what are those immediate or those negative activities of the physical and verbal negative

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.240
 activities?

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:38.240
 Those are known as the seven things to avoid negative activities.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:48.240
 Mainly is connected with the body, physical and verbal.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.240
 That's what then Buddha gives the morality. It's called the morality practices.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:59.240
 For example, for being at the practitioners in Buddhism, those are known as what?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:09.240
 They are practitioners. They are practitioners. And there is order in the practitioners.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:16.240
 They are practitioners, also there is generally this in the Buddha teaching called vows.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:25.240
 The V-O-W-O, vows. This vows has two vows.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.240
 Short-term vows and long-term vows.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:38.240
 Short-term vows is 24 hours to taking vows for 24 hours.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:48.240
 Long-term vows is then entire our lives as long as we live. We take vows.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:56.240
 Those are known as the short-term vows and the long-term vows.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:10.240
 In the vows, you are trying to reduce, or to stop these seven negative activities.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:23.240
 That three ayah by voting and four by speech. Seven things to Egypt.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:31.240
 And first I talk a little bit again, talk about these short-term vows.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:40.240
 Those are these vows as many of you know, the Nuni practices.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.240
 Nuni practices are short-term vows.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:51.240
 For example, 24 hours or they start, the great master or great female enlightenment nun,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:26:01.240
 known as Genomakamum, has traditionally is like two days. So that means 24 hours, two times.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:10.240
 So even though it's two days, 24 hours, two times is short-term vows.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:18.240
 Once you keep that vows, those are known as the S-principle vows that you keep.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:29.240
 Lord S-principals are three by the voting and four by the verbal speech.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:41.830
 And that is known as then three by the voting is not taking lives and not taking the belongings of

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.240
 others and sexual misconducts.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:27:01.240
 Those are the three by the voting. Four by the speeches are known as then.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:16.240
 Four by the speeches are known as then, not using the deceiving languages or symbolic from lying,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:31.240
 selenal and heart speech and then gossips. Those four are speeches. All togani is seven.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:37.240
 Seven. Seven those are seven basic vows.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:50.240
 Above that, one vow is not intoxicating. So avoiding the intoxicating things.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:58.710
 And then, in the Ghethamamapamos teaching, then there is editing, few more and those are known as

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.240
 then,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:11.240
 not singing, not dancing, not playing the music and not back up and using the performance.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:20.540
 And also not eating the afternoon foods. And in the Ghethamamapamos teaching, again, you don't eat

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.240
 for two days.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.240
 So those are all vowels are known as short time vowels.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:43.490
 Anybody who take that forever, and that is known as then the syllabacy, syllabacy of askas, all

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.240
 their practices.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:53.240
 And then you take that for forever. Then, so that is a short time vowel.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:29:01.450
 And then you take that to forever is called syllabacy of askas. Still is the lebras in syllabacy of

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.240
 askas.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:12.470
 Every you take, and then for permanent vowels, permanent vowels, they are known as then opaskas,

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.240
 and novice monks and nuns,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.240
 and fully ordained monks and nuns. Those are three groups, two groups.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:34.870
 And opaska is a lay practice. They take five persons, five vowels, and those are four, four of

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.240
 these is,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:55.070
 and not, what's called, that three by the voting, three by, not killing, not stealing, and sexual

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.240
 misconduct.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:06.240
 Three, and four is, fourth is not lying. Lying, did I say mister, mister?

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.240
 One more. One more, right? So that is four, above that is not toxicating.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:22.540
 Those are known as five persons, five persons, and so that, then it goes on, those are the, that is

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.240
 like male and female,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.240
 female, so opaska, lay practice in the male, and female would take that vowels.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:37.730
 So those are the basic principle vowels or the moralities and disciplinaries of the lay

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.240
 practitioners, lay practitioners.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:46.750
 One they take these vowels, generally they tell about the practitioner or the Canadian Buddhist

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.240
 schools, what is this?

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:57.850
 And naturally, they are what in the teachings, they should always, always more content, more

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:09.240
 content, more content and less desire, less craving, less craving, craving.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:30.240
 Doba chungma means less craving, more content, more content and less, less craving.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.240
 What are the current, the energy requirements?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.240
 The six or five pleasure objects, six or five pleasure objects.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:52.240
 Those are the pleasure objects of eyes, pleasure objects of the ears, pleasure objects of the nose,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:58.240
 pleasure objects of the tones, pleasure objects of the body.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.240
 Those are five sensory pleasure objects of senses.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:11.240
 Above that, five pleasure objects of the feelings or the mental states.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.240
 Mental states.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:20.240
 So those are known as all six pleasure objects.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.240
 So let's criving, criving on that.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:34.230
 Generally in the teachings, when you are less criving, criving, then what becomes? More content.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.240
 More content becomes.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:45.240
 So what do you have? Enjoy and appreciate. More grateful of what you have.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:55.240
 So that means, that happens. Naturally it comes. More calm and more peaceful. Less constructions.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.240
 And you are more central.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:04.100
 What that will bring you up, according in the teachings, it will bring more mindfulness. More calm

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.240
 and peaceful.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:13.710
 Your mind is become more really thoughtful. More respectful and appreciative. Generally the content

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.240
ment and less criving is very grip of mind from the states.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.240
 It is mindful. It's really that.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:27.240
 You can more enjoy what you have. More grateful. More grateful.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:35.090
 And then, what in the teachings said? In the Paravada or the Puneja Buddhist schools, then they do

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.240
 practice.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.240
 Now, when you have the good discipline, then they begin to practice.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.240
 Practicing is concentration. Concentration is then meditating.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:54.240
 Meditating. Meditating suggests positive begins mindfulness meditations.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:04.240
 Those are known as then joy and appreciation. Respect and joy and appreciation to one's own

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.240
 situation and circumstances.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:15.240
 Really more appreciative. More grateful. More thankful. That is the beginning of the mindfulness.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:23.370
 With these thoughts, they also see things. All these situations and circumstances in the world. It

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.240
's changing. It's a movement.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:31.240
 There's nothing. It's a empowerment. So reflecting the empowerment.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.240
 More reflecting of the empowerment. Thinking, that empowerment.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:44.230
 And more reflecting the empowerment and also you begin to more thankful, more grateful your

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:50.240
 situation and circumstances, life, and every opportunity.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.240
 Every soul and body are surrounded. More happy. More joyful.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.240
 Those are known as mindfulness practices.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:06.240
 When you begin that mindfulness practices, and then in the Puneja Buddhist schools, what do you do?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.240
 Shammata meditation. Shammata practices.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.240
 Mindfulness is the igniting of our calm and peaceful qualities.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:23.240
 But once you got there, then you begin to do that. Shammata meditation.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:30.240
 Shammata is the sound of the world at the many of your origins. Know that. It means calm and

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:30.240
 peaceful.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.240
 Dividing calm and peaceful status.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:41.450
 In order to begin that, to do that, all those Shammata meditation practices, such as breathing, med

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.240
itating on the breathing.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:51.230
 Breathing, calm, again, peaceful way, and relaxing, moving your mind with more peaceful way, more

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.240
 calm, and following the breathing.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.240
 Following the breathing. That is known as the Shammata meditation.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:06.240
 All the symbols concentrated in your mind, with some certain objects, meditation objects.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.240
 Relaxing and focusing as long as you can.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:18.240
 Relaxing. And then also see, kind of concentrated in our bodies.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:26.410
 Bodies is all in a Kaman meditation, in a Puneja Buddhist school, also tell all that this body is

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.240
 not just one solid object.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.240
 There are so many things in the body.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:38.240
 All the different, like, limbs in the part of the body, so many things, you concentrate on that.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.440
 All those are come through the joint now, so kind of nicely beautiful, but they are also almost

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:50.240
 every, every second, not just almost, every second is really changing, moving.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.240
 There's nothing is really, stays forever. Moving that.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:02.620
 So that externally, the universe is moving and changing completely, but even our physical system is

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.240
 changing and moving that.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:11.240
 And concentrate on those, more relaxed, calm, peaceful ways.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.240
 Even our breathing is changing.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.240
 Every movement, breathing is one after another, not just saying breathe.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.240
 We breathe every maybe second or whatever.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:32.240
 Again, breathe. But yet, we are perfectly, beautifully enjoying, existing and leaving.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:38.240
 And with again, joy and appreciation, calm and relaxedness.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.240
 When you do these practices with that way, what in the teaching says?

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.240
 It will bring more detachment, more calm.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.240
 It will loosen our grasping, clinginess.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:57.240
 We begin to see the way the universe and the world are existing, are really existing.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:04.240
 That is seeing exactly the way things are, according to the teaching, that is Abhidharma.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.240
 Seeing exactly the things as it is, not we call it up there.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.240
 Call it up there. Seeing the way things are, exactly.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.240
 You have seen something that we before never saw, or we would never pay attention.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.240
 Now we are finding out where things are.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:31.240
 And for that reason, then also in the teaching says, be more grateful, more happy, more joy.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:37.240
 Really, everything is in our control and in our table. How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.240
 At the same time, the teaching always told, there is some review of courage and commitment,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:49.240
 that I will use this beautiful opportunity, this fragile and kind of illusory,

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:55.240
 this opportunity to bring more good things for myself, for others.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.240
 Kind of feel that, relax and calm with that.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.240
 Calm with that.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.240
 And then in the teaching says, also come out of meditations,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.240
 such as in Protestant Buddhist schools.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:17.240
 You have, again, different emotions, such as our negative emotions making,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.240
 not letting us to stay calm and peaceful.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.240
 And what are those negative emotions?

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:35.240
 Anger, gallows, ignorance, attachments.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:42.240
 Those troubles, again, it makes more our suffering, unrest for students.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:48.240
 When you see those kind of difficult, those highlight emotions in the teaching says,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.240
 for example, when you have more attachment problems,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:59.240
 then see all these borders are changing, all the situation is changing.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.240
 Why I'm so attached?

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.240
 Why I'm not so attached?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.240
 I just move along as it is.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.240
 Not attracting me, how the nature of attraction is, it don't like to change,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.240
 it like to be exactly the same as it is.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.240
 That is just our only ignorance.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.240
 This is not abhidharma, everything that, that is un-abhidharma.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.240
 And we see things are, exactly the way things are kind of along with,

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.240
 moving along with that open mind and open heart.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.240
 That is the abhidharma.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.240
 That is truly we see things are as it is.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.240
 So for that reason, when we are so attached, meditating,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.240
 or recognizing the highlight of things are changing.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.240
 Not things are changing outside subject, object is changing,

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.240
 but subject is changing.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.240
 Our mental state, how much things change.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.240
 Since we have the memory, until now, it's always changed,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.240
 even in our own memory.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.240
 Our physical is changing, our situation is changed,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.240
 our circumstances are surrounded, and all those are really changing.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.240
 Therefore, kind of bring more open heart, open realization.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.240
 That is known as, in the teachings said, meditating on the detachment.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.240
 When we are so attracted, discovering the way things are,

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.240
 be in the way things are.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.240
 Aren't they?

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.240
 And then we have negative emotions, such as negative emotions or anger.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.240
 In the teachings said, loving kindness and compassion.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.240
 Even in the contemporary Buddhist school, even they don't highlight

00:41:52.240 --> 00:42:02.240
 loving kindness and compassion, but in the teachings said, meditating on the love.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.240
 Compassion, bring more love.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.240
 What is love actually?

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:11.240
 In the teachings said, love means beautiful.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.240
 Love means so nice.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.240
 All these things are existing.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.240
 All these subject and all these, without this all,

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:31.240
 all these subject and all object, we won't be happy.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:38.240
 Because of existing, everyone, others, we are really very happy.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.240
 It's good for us.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.240
 This is good learning places, places.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.240
 And then in the Mahayana Buddhism, what is it?

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.240
 As whatever we desire, they desire too, same way.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.240
 So why are we so upset and angry with that?

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:03.240
 And then also what we did, some mistakes, whatever, is due to their ignorance.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.240
 It's not the intention they lack, they bond with that bad,

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.240
 but this is due to ignorance.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.240
 Their negative emotions are disturbing to their mental state

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.240
 and then doing something.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.240
 So why should I be angry with that?

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.240
 If I am angry, I should be angry with ignorance.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.240
 Not to that physical, to that person or to that individual.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.240
 In order to do that, and anger to the ignorance,

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.240
 we cannot defeat anger with anger.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.240
 We have to be more wise, smart way and meditate on the loving kindness.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:44.240
 That well-defeated help today enough.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.240
 Those are really in achieving state.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:53.240
 So that is more meditating on the love when we have the anger problems.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.240
 And when we have more, again, same way, jealous problems.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:04.240
 When we have a jealous problem, same way of loving kindness

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.240
 and joy and appreciation, very more joy and more appreciation

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:16.240
 and more love and kindness and less grasping, less cling,

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.240
 to also other inner teachings.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.240
 Then when you have more troubles with all the business of thought,

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.240
 our mind cannot rest with that.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.240
 That's the teaching, meditating on the breathing, breathing.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.240
 That's the concentrate on the very breathing,

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.240
 well-help, consumption to a calm and peaceful state.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.240
 So those are non-meditation state of beliefs.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.240
 And then, in the Indonesian Buddhist schools,

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.240
 what are the, you know, when you practice the Vedayana Buddhism,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.240
 when you practice such as the Mundo practices,

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.240
 what are the foundation practices?

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:04.240
 What are known as poor renal sessions and taking reference?

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:09.240
 Those are foundation Buddhist schools, teachings.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:18.240
 Poor renal sessions suggest then that the precious bodies,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.240
 or precious lives.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.240
 And suggest then, next one is impermanent.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:33.240
 Next one is, is known as cause and effort, the inevitable.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:38.240
 And the fourth one is that samsara has difficulty and troubles.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:45.240
 Those are known as poor renal sessions, poor renal sessions.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.240
 And that is the foundation Buddhist school, teachers.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.240
 These teachings are known as in the Buddha's teaching,

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.240
 in the Buddha's first teaching for them, poor novelty of the teachings.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.240
 Suffering truths, cause of suffering truths.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.240
 This poor, renounced like a poor,

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:10.240
 is the condensed essence, teachings of the first two truths,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.240
 suffering truths and the cause of suffering truths.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:22.240
 Then taking reference, and that is following the path,

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.240
 path to truth, taking reference.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.240
 And suggest we target with the reference,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.240
 and then doing all those Shammata meditation and practice as seen.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:38.240
 Mindfulness, all those are known as path to truth, path to truth.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.240
 So with all these teachings, there is no Mahayana Buddhism

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.240
 and no Vadiyana Buddhism or poor renal sessions and ruffled practices.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:56.240
 So that is really how important of these foundation Buddhist schools are.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:02.240
 It's all the Mahayana Buddhism or certain Mahayana Buddhism

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.240
 and the Vadiyana Buddhism.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.240
 Buddhism is completely based upon the foundation Buddhist schools.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.240
 That's how it is developed.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:21.240
 So that is what is really about the foundation Buddhist schools.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.240
 Now we move to the second Buddhism.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.240
 And that is the Mahayana Buddhism.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.240
 And now, oh maybe I will do.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.240
 Have you had some questions about this foundation Buddhist schools?

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240
 Yes.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.240
 Have you?

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.240
 We have some microphones coming around.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:48.240
 Yes, please.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.240
 Thank you.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.240
 Good morning, thank you for having us.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:58.240
 I have to preface the question with a brief little intro here.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:08.240
 As a person of Irish existence, I am prepared to be somewhat disappointed by your answer here.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.240
 Either way.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.240
 So here's the question I have.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:23.240
 The prohibition against intoxication.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:36.240
 [laughter]

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.240
 So here's the question.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.240
 Is the prohibition against the use of any intoxicant?

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.240
 Or is the prohibition against becoming intoxicating?

00:48:49.240 --> 00:49:00.240
 [laughter]

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:06.240
 Fully prepared to be somewhat disappointed with your answer.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.240
 I'm trying to do every of my capabilities to not be disappointed.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.240
 [laughter]

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:23.240
 So all of you do that since we are the practicing of all three jhanas.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.240
 We are practicing of the Puerto Rican Buddhism schools.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240
 Puerto Rican Buddhism.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.240
 We are practicing of the Suttur Mahayana.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.240
 We are practicing of the Vayayana Mahayana.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.240
 So therefore there is some room.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.240
 [laughter]

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.240
 According to the Puerto Rican Buddhism teaching,

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:52.240
 there is no room to drink at all.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:59.240
 And you take the vowels, not at all room to drink.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.240
 And the teaching says you should not drink or use any intoxicant.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:15.240
 Even the drop of the grass or tip of grass or dew of grass.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.240
 Dew of grass.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.240
 That's really in the Puerto Rican Buddhist school teaching set.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.240
 I will tell the story.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.240
 I will tell the stories.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:35.240
 This is a very famous arhata known as lemon.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:42.240
 And during the Buddha's time, lemon was born,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.240
 I mean, the very wealthy family in India.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.240
 And these wealthy families are looking to help.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.240
 I'm sure maybe a few of you heard this story.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.240
 I said quite a few times.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:00.240
 But this wealthy family is really looking to help child.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.240
 But this couple did not have child, so long time.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:11.240
 They did every method, everything what the spiritual masters and instructions asked to do.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:20.240
 They did everything and didn't, the lady didn't consume it.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.240
 And they did so kind of unhappy that so all their wealth and everything,

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.240
 who will keep their lineage and wealth and all that things.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:36.240
 But finally, lady was conceived.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:42.240
 And because immediately she understood that she is now brachnad or conceived,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.240
 and that she impromptu her husband.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:52.240
 And that day, the family has very tragedies.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.240
 Big things happened.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.240
 Bad things happened through father, business and all that things.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.240
 So the moment that happened, but the moment those things happened,

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.240
 that moment he heard, "Oh, now his wife is conceived."

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.240
 So it was so happy.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.240
 Even though many things happened,

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.240
 but I'm so happy that news, news, welcomed that news.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.240
 He said, and he, so that's what.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.240
 Then, says he was, he's conceived,

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.240
 the family got one after another tragedies, one after another tragedies.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:35.240
 So now the child was born, and he was born.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:40.240
 So says father, the moment he heard that news,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.240
 he said, "Oh, this is welcome news."

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.240
 So then they think of now, share was born, what they give the names.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.240
 We will give the name, him, welcome.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.240
 Welcome.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.240
 So his name was, welcome baby.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.240
 Now welcome baby, when he was born,

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.240
 again many tragedy things happened in the family.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.240
 And soon after, the boy fell and died.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:11.240
 Now boy, but the welcome boy, baby must have come and become alone,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.240
 or no one who's, no one is really looking.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.240
 And one after another tragedy, and they're lucky with all that,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.240
 all that, and so then they're close, the family, the relatives are kept.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.240
 They also, the moment they kept looking after that baby,

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.240
 and again they had so many tragedies.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.240
 One after another, then the teaching said.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.240
 So soon after the relatives said,

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.240
 "Oh, this is not welcome, baby. This is an unwelcome baby."

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.240
 So they named unwelcome baby.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.240
 So now really the relatives are all so upset,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.240
 and then they have tried to do one after another,

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.240
 and then they finally, they kicked out.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.240
 "We don't want to keep this one."

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.240
 So now he looks like grown up maybe,

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.240
 about maybe six, seven, eight years old, around that.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.240
 So now they've kicked it out, and he's completely lost,

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.240
 and he don't have any place to go.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.240
 He's sitting on the road.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:13.240
 He's staying on the road, and he's just so unhappy, happy that.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.240
 At that time, then Buddha is, I mean Buddha,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:22.240
 we can't see all that situation, and the Buddha changed the route, direction.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.240
 Usually we go to the city for the food with his students,

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.240
 but that day Buddha changed the route.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.240
 He said to all the students, "We're going this way."

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.240
 So he went to a slightly different route.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.240
 On the road, this boy is staying,

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.240
 staying and crying.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.240
 And the moment he saw the Buddha kind of feel that he come

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.240
 and face all those students, he found that he's crying.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.240
 So why are you crying? All these things are asked.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.240
 Because I have no place to go, and relatives kicked out,

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.240
 the parents died, and all those things.

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.240
 So then he said, "Why do you not come with us?"

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.240
 And, of course, then he joined.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.240
 So he went with a poet after the Buddha and his students,

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.240
 and then he received a nice lunch,

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.240
 the family of others, whoever is invited.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.240
 Maybe he's another product of his big dharmapetra.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.240
 And while he got the food,

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.240
 and then he became a novice monk.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240
 He started.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.240
 So gradually, I mean a short, long story,

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.240
 then he received more teaching in the practice.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.240
 He meditated in the practices.

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.240
 Practices meditated, and he really become the ahadas.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.240
 He becomes our ahadas.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.240
 He reached high below there.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.240
 So now, even though he become the ahadas and big realizations,

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.240
 and no one is kind of respecting him much.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.240
 Everybody is kind of ignoring him there.

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.240
 And the Buddha thought, "This is not right, not right."

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.240
 Such as even though he has all those tragedies,

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.240
 but now he is really ahadas.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.240
 Who do these things?

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.240
 They are making kind of bad marriage, or bad karma.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.240
 So Buddha like to highlight him.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.240
 Highlight him there.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.240
 Highlight him.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.240
 And so, highlight.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.240
 At that time, in the far village somewhere,

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:24.240
 far from the village, Saraswara, there is one village.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.240
 They have a lot of trouble all the time with nagas.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.240
 They have so many trouble.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.240
 That is one nagas.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.240
 They are so short-templed, temperamental,

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.240
 and they are making so much trouble all the time.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.240
 This naga is making trouble.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.240
 So the villages did so many things.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.240
 Whatever they do, they are always not right.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.240
 They are making so much trouble, this naga.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.240
 So then the villages came to Buddha and asked,

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.240
 "Please, will you subdue and help to our village

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240
 to subdue that naga?"

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.240
 So Buddha said, "Yes," but at the same time,

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.240
 Buddha kind of looked along with all the Sangha members.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.240
 He looked to this not welcome, the ahadas.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.240
 He looked to him kind of strongly.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.240
 Immediately grew up.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.240
 That one who was, I mean, he also looked to the Buddha.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.240
 He is nada.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.240
 He sees what Buddha wants him.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.240
 So what one wants him.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.240
 And in the teaching, when the Buddha is teaching,

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.240
 when the Buddha is more kind of democratic,

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.240
 if you like to accept that imitation,

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.240
 then they will bring kind of strength,

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.240
 because the strength of the morality,

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.240
 the strength of the morality,

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.240
 anybody like to do that,

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.240
 to kind of activate and perform that,

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.240
 they pick up the stone.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240
 I'm sorry, not stick.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.240
 They will pick up the sticks.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.240
 So Buddha in the teaching said,

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:57.240
 "He executed his arms as an elephant thrown

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.240
 and picked up one stick."

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240
 That's straight.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.240
 "Among the grew sticks."

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.240
 Everybody thought, "Wow, what he's doing?"

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.240
 He don't know what he's doing now.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.240
 Now he's just picking up that.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.240
 And he picked it up.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.240
 Then, of course, the Buddha did not say anything.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.240
 When he picked up, the Buddha said,

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.240
 "Welcome," and that's it.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.240
 So next day, now he accepted,

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.240
 he's going to take care of that naga.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:30.240
 So the woman went to the city and had the food.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.240
 He burned the food in a begging arms bowl.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:38.240
 Then he went to that village.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.240
 And particularly the village said,

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.240
 "You said there's one spring."

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240
 Spring.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.240
 Yeah, spring.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.240
 Well, that is a naga place.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240
 He stays there.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.240
 That naga place.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.240
 So he went there, that area,

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:59.240
 and he sat down so peacefully, quietly, that happened.

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.240
 When naga saw that, he said,

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.240
 "Naga saw that."

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.240
 The naga thought,

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.240
 "Oh, this is really kind of like a strange, wondering moment.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.240
 He don't know how awful I am," he thought.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.240
 But he is the England,

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.240
 so he's going to need that just alone.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.240
 So he sits there, nearby there,

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.240
 and he eats the food, begging the bowl.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.240
 He gets up nicely, gently,

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.240
 and went to that spring.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.240
 And then he whined his bowl,

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.240
 his bowl in that spring,

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.240
 and naga was really upset.

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.240
 According to this in India,

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.240
 and particularly in the teachings,

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.240
 the naga don't like in his left arm.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240
 It remains.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.240
 It remains.

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.240
 It's really not happy.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.240
 So he whined his arm's bowl,

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.240
 and what was it called?

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.240
 The dirty water or whatever the arm.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.240
 He pulled back to that spring water.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:59.240
 At that moment, naga was so angry,

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.240
 and he jumped up in the sky,

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.240
 he met big thunderstorms.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.240
 And he put the thunderbolt to the loom.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.240
 And loom went back to the spot where he stood,

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.240
 and he meditated on the lowing kinds.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240
 Lowing kinds.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.240
 That didn't do anything,

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.240
 or those thunderbolt nothing affected that other loom.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.240
 And now, kind of the naga,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.240
 that is desperate for what to do.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.240
 At that moment, loom emanated big,

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.240
 higher rain, higher rain,

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.240
 and that completely kind of blocked the naga,

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.240
 that naga, and he couldn't go anywhere, naga.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.240
 And finally, he came to naga,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.240
 that naga thing, or naga, the loom,

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240
 and said, "Why are you making me trouble?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240
 "What reason I did?

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.240
 "What I did?" he said.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.240
 And loom said, "Because you didn't do anything to me,

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.240
 "but you're doing disturbing all these villages,

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:06.240
 "because that's what I'm going to make gentle in people."

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.240
 So then he said, "Yes, I will listen.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.240
 "What do you want to do?"

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.240
 He said, "No, you don't have to do anything to me,

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.240
 "and you must take that commitment to be my teacher.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.240
 "Teacher, which means Buddha."

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.240
 So then in the teaching he said that naga becomes small snake,

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.240
 and loom put in his begging bowl that snake,

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.240
 he went to the shalasta, get up and grow,

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.240
 with that naga in the begging bowl,

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.240
 and put on the Buddha,

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.240
 and then naga takes a while that he's not going to be disturbed

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.240
 to the villages.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240
 So then that's happened.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.240
 And now, the loom, that not welcome,

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.240
 become back to his normal name, loom,

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.240
 who welcome, and it becomes so kind of quite famous.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.240
 Wow, he got such a realization.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240
 He's the greatest.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.240
 You're the naga, and this really become very kind of honored ones.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.240
 He become honored ones.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.240
 And then one day, this honored one

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.240
 went to the, kind of separately to him,

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.240
 placed it because of the food.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.240
 I mean, midday they take only one kind of food.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.240
 So he went in the different villages,

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.240
 and where his old friend, his family friend,

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240
 he was there.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.240
 And so he went there, and there also this old friend

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.240
 who his family's friend, family friend, old friend,

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240
 very happy.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.240
 Now, this loom has become so special,

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240
 highly realized beings,

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.240
 and he so do the naga in that villages,

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.240
 and he's so happy.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.240
 So then he kind of feel happy,

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.240
 and then he offered him the lunch, and he had lunch,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.240
 and that time, Buddha did not made any rules

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.240
 about the alcohols or the toxicating things.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:12.240
 So then this family friend offered him the alcohol,

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.240
 alcohol drinks.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.240
 So then he drank the alcohols.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240
 Now he drank, he drank, and drank, and drank.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.240
 He's really toxicating, really intoxicated.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.240
 So now after he completed his food and all that things,

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.240
 then our loom is walking back to the ashram

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.240
 or to the hermitage where he's going to sleep.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.240
 I'm with Sharva Sadaq.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.240
 On the road where he's walking, he couldn't walk.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.240
 He fell down.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.240
 He fell down with that, and he fell asleep.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240
 He fell asleep there.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240
 What?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240
 He fell asleep.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240
 He fell asleep.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.240
 He fell asleep there.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.240
 At that time, again, Buddha is walking to the city

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.240
 and coming, and Buddha changed the route,

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.240
 and he announced that we were going to meet with.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.240
 So well, well, Buddha is walking with his Sangha members,

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.240
 and every Sangha member saw one of their students

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.240
 that were in the row, and who was fell down

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.240
 on the street and falsely sleeping.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.240
 And when they came to closely, it was in the room.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.240
 He was in the room.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.240
 And Buddha said, "Who is he?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.240
 He's this our room."

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240
 And then Buddha said, "You think so?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.240
 Now he can subdue the Naga?"

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.240
 "Naga, he can subdue."

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.240
 And every student said, "No, I don't.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.240
 He can subdue the, don't mention the Naga,

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.240
 but even he can't do anything with the small insect,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.240
 or small insect."

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.240
 And why is that happening?

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.240
 Because of the toxicating.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240
 That's it.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240
 That's what happens.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.240
 So put that on, then Buddha gives the rules.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240
 They're not really toxicating.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.240
 Even the tip of the blade of the grass,

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.240
 or dew of grass, they should not do it.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.240
 Should not toxicate it.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.240
 So that is the rule in the Vinaya,

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.240
 or in the foundation Buddhist schools.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:17.240
 And then Mahayana schools.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:22.240
 Schools, their app is important, important,

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.240
 and as necessary, you can have little bit, little bit,

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.240
 but not lost your mindfulness.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.240
 Why, why, why Buddha give this teaching in the Vinayam,

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.240
 or the Thera, Prigabuddha school?

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:44.240
 Because my, the toxicating things will lose the mindfulness.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.240
 Even this great aha land that lost the mindfulness,

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
 completely fell down.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:55.240
 So it really will need numerous obstacles and hindrance

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.240
 to in the life and the practices.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.240
 So that's why that.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
 So in Mahayana, in the teaching field,

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.240
 then after as long as you're not lost with the mindfulness,

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.240
 then you can have little bit, little bit.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.240
 And the Vaidyana Buddhism is the same thing.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.240
 It has Mahayana, you can have little bit,

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.240
 but again, not lost control.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.240
 And then good practice of the Mahayana or the Vaidyana Buddhism,

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.240
 there's many stories of the great yogis, of the yoginis.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.240
 They really consume the big content of the alcohols and all that,

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:36.240
 and still they're nothing effect with their realization

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.240
 and their power of the spiritual qualities,

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.240
 they're kind of shining, blended as a billion sun.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.240
 Sun, there's many stories of those in the Vaidyana teaching.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:58.240
 But still, I have not drew too much until I lost that mindfulness.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.240
 So that is my answer.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.240
 [laughter]

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:11.240
 [applause]

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.240
 Yes, yes, yes.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.240
 Yes, building on Bob's question.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.240
 [laughter]

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.240
 My assumption is that when it says intoxicants,

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.240
 it means any intoxicants.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240
 I mean, I know you spoke about alcohol,

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.240
 and the context was alcohol,

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.240
 but I would think that it would apply to any kind of drug,

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.240
 anything whatsoever that would cloud and obscure your mind, right?

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240
 That's really true.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240
 Okay, thank you.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.240
 That's it.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.240
 Because it is like what we're talking of the primary goal,

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.240
 primary goal and principle teaching of this,

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.240
 the alcohol is really in the teaching,

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.240
 it's the mindfulness.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:56.240
 If we lose the mindfulness, then anything is like,

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.240
 and should not, should eliminate it.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.240
 Eliminate it, yeah.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.240
 Yes, yes, please.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:14.240
 [inaudible]

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.240
 So we're so grateful for your teaching.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.240
 So, so grateful to be honored by you.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.240
 Thank you.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.240
 Just wanted to ask you, in America we have a great tradition

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.240
 of singing and dancing for many different reasons.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.240
 Singing in churches and temples and synagogues,

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.240
 and for the joy of God.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.240
 And singing in romantic ways to encourage people

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.240
 to meet partners and to get married and help families.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.240
 And it's innocent, they can be innocent,

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.240
 then there can be singing that's not so innocent.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.240
 But if it's innocent and from the heart, is that okay?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.240
 Dancing and singing, that is of that nature.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240
 Is that okay?

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:03.240
 Yeah, this is again, in a pedestrian Buddhist school,

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.240
 if you take the ordinations, if you take the vows,

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.240
 then really the teaching said, should not do.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.240
 That is the pedestrian Buddhist school.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240
 Again, same thing.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.240
 There is many again, because Buddha made so many of those,

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.240
 all these guidelines, because even this happened

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240
 during his lifetime, and Buddha said,

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.240
 then no, no, that's what really is all happening.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.240
 So if the pedestrian Buddhist school,

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.240
 singing and dancing are then just really kind of restricted.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.240
 Then again, as the same answer, in Mahayana Buddhism

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.240
 and Vaidyana Buddhism, then definitely you can do those efforts.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.240
 If you have the reason, reason and the big purpose,

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.240
 you can do, but again singing and dancing.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.240
 So generally, why in the Vaidyana or in Mahayana Buddhism,

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.240
 also teaching says, you should not do,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.240
 because F is distracting too much.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.240
 If it's distracting too much, your principle goal,

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240
 or the practitioner's principle goal,

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.240
 is to restrain it, reactivate it, our inner realization,

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.240
 our realization of loving kindness, compassion,

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.240
 and understanding of the true nature,

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.240
 and those we do too many times, then you kind of distract it,

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.240
 and then it will lead, that will also,

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.240
 numerous kind of troubles and distractions,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.240
 and then kind of emotions arise with that one after another,

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.240
 so that for those reasons, then, and kind of also,

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.240
 you should do moderation and with mindfulness, those are said.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.240
 But if you have big reasons and then kind of big goals,

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.240
 then of course you can do, and Vaidyana teaching often also said,

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:03.240
 you can do that with, again, with awareness, with awareness.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.240
 Awareness with the same thing and dancing,

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.240
 then it is good because you're not losing your awareness,

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.240
 your realization, and keep expressing those, your inner realization,

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.240
 and then it is good because not just for you,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.240
 according to Vaidyana teaching, the whole universe is dancing.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.240
 Now, really, the whole thing is dancing,

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.240
 dancing and singing and there's nothing,

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.240
 it's not singing and not dancing, it's all moving so beautifully,

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.240
 perfectly, balancely, it's just really creating the dynamic display

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.240
 of the universe and beauty, sun and moon and star,

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.240
 and everything is just shimmering and lightning,

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.240
 those are the teachings, but with awareness.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.240
 So poetic, so beautiful. Thank you so much.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.240
 Thank you.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.240
 I have a question about this.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.240
 I was one of those kids that was born in India.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.240
 Was it because of his karma that he went through so much drama

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.240
 and taking birth with this wealthy family?

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.240
 Yeah, because it is really, according to teaching,

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.240
 the Buddha teaching is his karma,

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.240
 his karma and karma of the family, karma of the hand,

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.240
 so it's not something that happened by himself.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.240
 But it's a past life karma.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.240
 Past life karma, not this life, past life karmas.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.240
 Yeah, past life karmas.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.240
 But he went through a lot of drama.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.240
 Yeah, he really went, he went a lot of drama,

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.240
 but also the end, himself ending was really good,

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.240
 according to the Buddha teaching, he got realization

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.240
 that was also a benefit to all the connected ones,

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.240
 the family of parents, everyone really was a benefit.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.240
 But he wasn't asked to come into the world,

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.240
 he came in because of his parents.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.240
 Yeah, that's true. So it's karma,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.240
 all the karmas of everyone according to teaching them.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.240
 But then, first of all, also he is the karma,

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.240
 then he lost the parents,

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.240
 then he didn't have anyone looking after him very nicely,

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.240
 and then the relatives are looking, but also those all.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.240
 So his whole teaching is really karma,

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.240
 and in the Buddha teaching often he said,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.240
 the karma where things happen is also really,

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.240
 kind of, very inconceivable,

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.240
 just that you can't answer everything easily.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.240
 But it is not happening without any cause and conditions.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.240
 And by his parents wanting children,

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.240
 they wanted a kid so that they can be happy,

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.240
 but that didn't mean that they would have been happy,

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.240
 it made them miserable, and they went through a lot of drama.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.240
 They didn't get to enjoy it, so it means that if we want things,

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.240
 sometimes it's not meant for us, and we shouldn't want things,

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.240
 because we came with nothing, we go with nothing.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.240
 So maybe we're better off with nothing.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.240
 Yeah, that's true.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.240
 And that's what I see as being, that's what it would end up being,

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.240
 because if we have nothing, we come with nothing,

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.240
 we would not have all this drama and karma,

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.240
 by not wanting children.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.240
 I have no kids because I felt like if they have to,

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240
 they come straight from heaven, so I wouldn't want,

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.240
 because I'm not taking the drama of even taking care of kids.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.240
 So I'd be like, I'm free, I am free from that,

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.240
 but I always told that you can even have luck

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240
 kids or bad luck.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.240
 It can bring in bad karma, good karma,

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.240
 because you bring in a soul, and you don't know

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.240
 where the soul is coming from, a bad karma, a good karma.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.240
 So it's a toy, it's a very good toy.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240
 Thank you so much.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.240
 Oh, you're welcome.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.240
 Can you feel all this?

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.240
 Oh yeah, karma, karma.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
 Thank you.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240
 And thank you for the lovely story.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.240
 And I'm very happy that we are part of the Mahayana.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.240
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.240
 And back to that question.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.240
 I wanted to share with my Irish friends.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240
 Thank you, Ben.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.240
 And I wanted to share, Kimpo, that there

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.240
 is a group of monks that make beer.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.240
 And the beer is called Shimei.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.240
 And they were asked to produce more beer,

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.240
 because it's a very fine beer.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:32.240
 And the monks said, we do not exist.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.240
 We do not-- let me get it right.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.240
 Oh, we do not exist to make beer.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240
 We make beer to exist.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240
 So I just wanted to put that out, Bob.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.240
 And I think we may be able to have the middle way, Kimpo.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.240
 A little bit of beer together.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
 Thank you, Kimpo.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:53.740
 Thank you.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.240
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240
 It's called--

01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240
 I'll buy it.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240
 I'll buy it for you.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240
 Shimei.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240
 Oh, God.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240
 Thank you, Kimpo.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.240
 Pete?

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240
 Right there?

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.240
 Pete.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.240
 Pete.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.240
 [LAUGHTER]

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240
 It's very easy.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240
 [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.240
 Yeah, thanks.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.240
 And thanks for coming here today.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.240
 I wonder if you know how minding it is when you are here

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.240
 and speak to us like this.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.240
 Excuse me.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.240
 But anyway, I have actually a true life story, something that

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.240
 happened to me just within like the past year.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.240
 And I'm hoping your explanation or answers too can help clear

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.240
 the question about how to develop that state of mind

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.240
 or how exactly that's our state of mind should be so we lose

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.240
 all of that stress and negative emotion.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.240
 The story goes a little over a year ago--excuse me.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.240
 I was brought into a relationship with this person.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:05.240
 Yes, this woman and I questioned it from the first time.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.240
 I had nothing to do with it.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.240
 It just kind of came out of the blue really.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.240
 Whether technology is a curse to the world or not is irrelevant,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.240
 I guess.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.240
 And I'm not sure of the fact that she was very sick.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.240
 This woman is also irrelevant or not even.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.240
 But she came on to me and basically I had accused her of

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.240
 having some kind of motive, ulterior motive for just wanting

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240
 to be involved with me.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.240
 I had my theories, of course, but that's also irrelevant.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.240
 Anyhow, I just right from the beginning started to accuse her

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.240
 and say I don't want any part of it.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.240
 And I accused her of having motives.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240
 Of course, it was my ego.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.240
 I had this instinct.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.240
 No one's got better instincts than me.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240
 Everybody has to tell me about it.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
 Everyone who knows me probably can talk about it.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.240
 I mean, according to me, of course, it's my ego.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.240
 Every day I just kept accusing her.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.240
 She's got some kind of motive or whatnot.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.240
 But anyhow, I know it was a test for me.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.240
 I handled it better than I would have like many years ago.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.240
 And I know that a more advanced practitioner would have handled

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240
 it a lot better.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.240
 From my point of view, where do we get the state of mind?

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.240
 What state of mind should we have that would just lose

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240
 all of our ego and just kind of let it happen?

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.240
 Do you follow what I'm saying?

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.240
 I think so.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:41.240
 [laughter]

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.240
 I think, yeah, then I understand.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240
 So, yeah?

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.240
 Thank you.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.240
 If I can get my point across, what's your explanation?

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.240
 It's more about how we develop that state of mind

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.240
 or what comes first, the wanting to develop the state of mind,

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240
 the losing of the ego.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:07.240
 And that is generally how to take care of this kind of situation.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.240
 And most of the time, according to Buddhism point of view,

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:18.240
 first is always as much as you can, more open mind.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.240
 Open mind is really very, very important, kind of openness.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:28.240
 That means openness of not just you or I want this way.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240
 I want that way.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.240
 If you have that thought, you're not so open

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.240
 because you're kind of regulating where things are.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:42.240
 So first of all, your openness mind, that whatever comes,

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.240
 I'm going to accept that situation then.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.240
 So that means your mind or your heart is a little bit more calm

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.240
 and peaceful, more open.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:59.240
 With that thought, then you deal the situation with it again,

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:04.240
 with the courage, with the commitment of your loving kindness

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.240
 and compassion, and deal with that situation.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.240
 Again, with the understanding of that person.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.240
 For example, the other person is a person too.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.240
 They have also desire, they have emotion, they have thought.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:24.240
 So trying to kind of cooperate, which suits you both nicely

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.240
 and comfortably, and maybe accepting something,

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:34.240
 you will accept that other persons are also thinking and desire that.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.240
 And also, other ones do the same way.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.240
 And then kind of mutual understanding, mutual agreement,

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240
 more calm and peaceful.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.240
 But bring both sides, the more loving kindness and compassion,

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.240
 same time with open heart and open mind.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.240
 I think that's what really most the time in the teaching mentioned that.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.240
 I understand that.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.240
 Thank you.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.240
 That also seems to me from what you said, that takes into play the fact

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.240
 that we aren't perfect and we can't be perfect.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.240
 I don't know how much I have.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.240
 And our heart would be perfect and we would be able to be completely open.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.240
 Like I said, I did my best for the whole situation

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.240
 and I know it's going to be the hardest test I've probably ever faced.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:31.240
 But if you can handle that, even though it's difficult and hard,

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.240
 you said that if you were able to do it and you did that,

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.240
 you should feel happy in joy.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240
 You did good.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.240
 That means you're really in courage in your reward,

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.240
 your courage and your love and compassion.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.240
 It's very difficult to deal with this situation.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.240
 And somebody of course also really is helping to the other partners

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.240
 and helping to support that.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.240
 We teach you to feel happy and joyful.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.240
 At the same time, keep that kind of open heart and open mind

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.240
 and really rest them in compassion.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.240
 Then help and support and reactivate,

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.240
 which is good for you and good for the other partner.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.240
 And there is also according to Buddhism that is practicing.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.240
 You're doing good things, that is practicing.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.240
 We're not going to do immediately right things

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.240
 and everything, every way good and things.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.240
 But every improve, we're doing good.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.240
 That means you're advancing, you're deepening,

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.240
 and which is as you're revealing your goodness, call it.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.240
 From the only edge of the mind, then that is according to Buddhism.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.240
 You're practicing, you're good.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.240
 Thank you.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.240
 That was basically what I was looking at.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:46.240
 I mean, what I understood is what I'm saying.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240
 I mean, I did the best I could.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.240
 I guess one of the real greatest that we can't be 100 percent.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.240
 I really took practice if it happened again.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240
 I would have learned a lot.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.240
 But always the sense of a practicing is always trying to activate it

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.240
 a little bit stronger, a little bit deeper,

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.240
 a little bit wider as much as you can.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.240
 That is the practicing.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.240
 That is the learning, and that is your advancing according.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.240
 But that's not how we go.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.240
 We develop ourselves.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.240
 Really or really, we deepen ourselves.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.240
 Not just immediately stop, oh, that's too much, this and that.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.240
 Then we become kind of small mind, and we close ourselves,

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.240
 which is not, then we really won't progress, or we won't do that too much.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.240
 Thank you.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240
 Okay.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.240
 Yes, yes, thank you.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240
 Yeah.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240
 Please, yeah.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.240
 I am humbled and honored to be in your presence.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.240
 Thank you for being here.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:53.240
 Of course I understand that detaching is the main tenet of Buddhism,

01:23:53.240 --> 01:24:03.240
 but I have to ask you how to remain and stay in the place of detachment

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.240
 when someone that you love is suffering terribly

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:14.240
 and you have no ability to create change or help them,

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:20.240
 and you literally have to watch severe suffering.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.240
 So vis-a-vis, you know, the infinity, that's all on one side of the infinity,

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.240
 and I'm supposed to, because I do meditate very much so,

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.240
 I do practice mindfulness.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.240
 But to detach and almost observe or bear witness to suffering

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:45.240
 when you have no input and to remain detached is my problem.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:51.240
 Generally it is true, Buddhism is really always teaching on the detachment,

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.240
 detachment, a lot of teachings on the detachment.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.240
 But why is Buddhism talking detachment?

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:03.240
 Because nature is not attached, nature is not detached.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:09.240
 But present times we do more attached to reverse that,

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.240
 to loosen up that Buddha's teaching on the detachments.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:23.240
 But this detachment is not, detachment is talking about not too much emotions.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:28.240
 Otherwise, Buddhism talks so much, so much,

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.240
 or strongly emphasizes of loving kindness and comparison,

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.240
 good things to every living being.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.240
 That is also, in a way, it is attachment.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.240
 It is not detachment, you're really explaining, you're promoting,

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.240
 you're finally focusing kindness and compassion and love and peace

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.240
 and happiness to every living being.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.240
 It is like, have some degree of the attachment,

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.240
 but it's not negative emotions.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.240
 This time when you talk in love and compassion,

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.240
 Buddhism is open, calm, peaceful, peaceful, soothing.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.240
 When you see these pupils who are having this kind of trouble,

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.240
 difficult things, when you cannot do anything,

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240
 why didn't the Buddha teach it?

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.240
 You send more love, more compassion, really weak,

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.240
 that is, I'm going to talk this after this.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.240
 The poor, boneless, I'm sure you heard loving kindness, such a boneless love,

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.240
 boneless compassion, really immersing love and compassion.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.240
 Seeing this individual, that individual is,

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:38.240
 and there's not just only that one, there's so many beings in the world.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.240
 So really weak, good things, and then do some prayers

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.240
 and your, whatever your beliefs, and really blessing,

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.240
 and all that power sent to that, to that individual.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.240
 That is, you see how much you can do love,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.240
 but not truly negative emotion, not so,

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.240
 I mean, emotion is not negative, but not true emotion,

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.240
 kind of think of all this, but just more calm and peaceful,

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.240
 really open your, again, heart and mind and love and compassion,

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.240
 and just wishing good things, this, this, this,

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.240
 that individual is going through this,

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.240
 but by this, make this completely exhausted,

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.240
 all that can, whatever the cause and condition,

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.240
 on the other word, in the Buddha teaches the karma,

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240
 complete in the financial, make this kind of trouble,

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.240
 the difficult never happened to any individual,

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.240
 that finished by my power of the meditation,

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.240
 my power and intention on the love and compassion,

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.240
 really reaching the, send the big healing power of your mental,

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.240
 to power of the mind, healing power,

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.240
 to that individual, to other, that's what really you can do,

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.240
 and according to teaching, if you do that,

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.240
 it really happens to you, and also something is happening to others,

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.240
 that individual and others.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.240
 Thank you for that, and let me just share with you,

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:06.240
 so for five years, I did that.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.240
 I took the highest road possible,

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.240
 I spoke with peacefulness and openness and kindness,

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:19.240
 and softness, and literally took the highest road possible.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240
 As I am the voice of truth,

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.240
 there's very big things that have happened,

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.240
 that I have clarification and answers to be able to give.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.240
 Now the door has shut, communication is off,

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.240
 and so that's how much the truth is being blocked.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.240
 When you spoke about, you know,

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.240
 lying and pain and negative behavior,

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.240
 so the person is in that environment,

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.240
 kind of bathing in that negativity.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.240
 I'm on the other side, waiting,

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.240
 but the door has to be opened and it's shut.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:59.240
 So for five years, I have taken the highest road possible,

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.240
 regarding my communication,

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.240
 and regarding just love, pure, pure, pure,

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.240
 unconditional love, love, love, love, love.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.240
 But now, another party is involved,

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.240
 and because it's about the truth, I am blocked.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.240
 And so that's the detachment,

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.240
 now I'm in that zone of detachment.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.240
 It's so painful, I cannot even show you.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.240
 But now also you should, I mean, you did everything.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.240
 Everything.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.240
 On the other side, really everything.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.240
 You have beautiful principles, so trying to, again,

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.240
 that happens, you just have to run some building,

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.240
 accept that situation, and don't be kind of like,

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.240
 staying on that uncomfortable, feeling state.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.240
 Let that go and bring more your courage, more love.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.240
 Being here is part of it, being in this environment,

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.240
 and just staying pure and clean and waiting

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.240
 for a knock on the door, metaphorically, you know?

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.240
 That's it, really, that's it.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.240
 A quarter of us are seeking,

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.240
 and I heard from other great masters,

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.240
 when these things happen, you cannot control.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240
 When you don't have the ability to control,

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.240
 and don't worry, and don't say,

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.240
 let's worry, let's think of that,

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.240
 let it go, relax on the present moment.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240
 Relax on the present moment,

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240
 generate more love and compassion,

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.240
 and make good things to everyone and to those individuals

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.240
 that may, may, they will have some wisdom

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:32.240
 and more knowledge so that it's not completely blocked,

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.240
 and all that.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.240
 We've seen those things really in the teaching set.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.240
 See, communication has been blocked,

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:44.240
 so it's purposely, so it's like screaming on the mountain

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.240
 and no one's there, it's really treacherous.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240
 Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.240
 Yeah, but thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:54.240
 Okay, one more, then we start.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.240
 Maybe you'd like to go up to have some holidays, right?

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.240
 Kimpo, thank you so much for coming today.

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.240
 Oh, thank you.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.240
 We're very glad I'm here.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.240
 I'm right here.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.240
 You know, Kimpo, several years ago,

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.240
 I read what you were teaching us about,

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:17.240
 that the Buddha had started now singing and dancing, okay?

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.240
 She read before the Buddha had done singing and dancing.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:25.240
 And, you know, at that moment, you know,

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.240
 it became very disheartened because I'm a singer.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.240
 And I thought, oh my gosh,

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.240
 how can I ever become a Buddhist at that time?

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.240
 And then I thought, well, don't worry about that.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.240
 Let's just put that aside for now.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.240
 Let's just study and do what we're doing.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:44.240
 So then I bought a book about old Tibetan tales, all right,

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.240
 old Tibetan stories, and every other story

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.240
 was about a singing monastic, okay?

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.240
 Every other story, and I got a little confused.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.240
 I'm like, well, the monk is singing,

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.240
 and they're like, you know,

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.240
 but I'm confused because monk is, and he's like in bliss,

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.240
 and he's, you know, he's singing,

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.240
 and he's, you know, in that beautiful place.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.240
 And I'm thinking, but the Buddha said,

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240
 no singing and dancing.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.240
 So now I'm getting a little confused,

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:17.240
 and I think, well, there must be an exception to this rule.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:23.240
 And then, of course, you had said that Mahayana singing is okay

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:28.240
 in the right situation, but we don't lose our mindfulness.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.240
 So if I am meditating and I feel like singing in my meditation,

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.240
 that's okay?

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.240
 This is okay.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240
 That's okay.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.240
 Meditation, in particular, for example, in the Vedayana teaching,

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:44.240
 when you visualize yourself as a Buddha and a deity,

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.240
 and then when you are singing or the chanting, those pray,

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.240
 and you will return yourself.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.240
 And that's really fine.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.240
 That's good, actually good in the Vedayana teaching.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.240
 He said, singing and dancing.

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.240
 That's what you heard Lama dancing.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.240
 Lama dancing and Lama singing those in the teachings.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.240
 Because at that time, according to the teaching,

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.240
 also when you dance and when you're singing,

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:14.240
 at that time, you are in a state of that divine mandala,

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.240
 or the Buddha mandala, and the Vedayana mandala,

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.240
 then they are all in the country.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.240
 Everyone is in a different gesture, in a different mood,

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:28.240
 in a different colors, in a different Vedayana teaching, really.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.240
 Highly appreciated.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.240
 But again, same thing in the teaching, Vedayana teaching.

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.240
 Same thing, don't lose the awareness.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:40.240
 Or that means, don't lose the mindfulness of the meditation

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.240
 while you are meditating.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.240
 With that, then you are really making big meditually activity,

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.240
 singing and dancing.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.240
 Thank you so much, Kimpo. I'm so relieved.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.240
 I'm so happy. Thank you.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.240
 Me and you, Ray, me and you.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240
 Yes, yes, okay.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240
 Just this very quick.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.240
 So, singing out of devotion, out of bhakti, out of singing,

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.240
 out of devotion, you know, keeping your mindfulness and awareness,

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.240
 that's good.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.240
 That's good. That's good.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.240
 Thank you.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.240
 Particularly, when you do those singing and dancing,

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.240
 I would say you do, I guess, every group is going,

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.240
 then, of course, you can do.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.240
 Otherwise, you do that yourself alone, when you are practicing,

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.240
 and chanting and singing, and we build a tone, you do that.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.240
 But if you are doing group, sangha practice, talk with it,

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.240
 then do the rest, follow the sangha,

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.240
 harmony and sangha tune in the same way.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.240
 So, it is not just, again,

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.240
 it's not becoming like distractions to the others.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.240
 Even, it's maybe not, it's not distracting your awareness,

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.240
 your mindfulness, but it could affect you.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.240
 So, therefore, keep the same way,

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.240
 in the way you do your breath practice, it's important.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.240
 We're talking about your being,

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.240
 we're also talking about the pascal,

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.240
 but also those, for those who have not taken vials,

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.240
 not just symptom practitioners,

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.240
 then they have the openness to participate with it.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.240
 Oh, yeah, yeah, but then it does, generally, again,

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.240
 I mean, there is anilore, anilore is saying that,

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:25.240
 what I'm saying is, not drinking,

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.240
 not having the toxicity, those are the vowels,

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.240
 when you take the opasaka vowels, opasaka vowels.

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.240
 And so then, opasaka is a Sanskrit word,

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.240
 which means live practicing, every simple little bit, after that.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.240
 Then, you don't do that.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:44.240
 If you do not take that vowels, then, I mean, you're free.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240
 But still, as a being practicing,

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.240
 the sangha members in the teaching always said

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.240
 that they could not lose the mindfulness.

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.240
 And what did the teaching say?

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.240
 Have you toxicated yourself?

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:04.240
 It will lead numerous problems, numerous problems.

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.240
 Have you really toxicated yourself?

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.240
 That, I mean, we see, is not just only in Buddhism,

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.240
 it's in the world.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240
 We see how much troubles are happening.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.240
 Even your high education, even your soul rate, wealth, and pain,

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.240
 would, if you do those things, really, I mean,

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:26.240
 become the habit, and then you lose the kind of happiness

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.240
 and the joy, then kind of like,

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.240
 even enjoyment of one's own self,

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.240
 but not just the nature of the practice,

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.240
 enjoyment of the peace, of the harmony of the family members,

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.240
 kind of also demolishing that.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.240
 So that's what the teaching is.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.240
 Lead numerous troubles.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.240
 Yeah.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.240
 So Buddha, back in the day, didn't have internet,

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240
 and all these technologies.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.240
 And some of the technologies today are really helpful.

01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.240
 It spreads, even for our own group, it spreads the dharma.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.240
 We have videos and YouTube, which spread the teachings,

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.240
 and that's an example.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.240
 We use Twitter and so on.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:15.240
 But, however, that's the same thing as dancing and drinking

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:20.240
 when it's used to, when people become mindless from it.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.240
 You know, there's people, they become addicted to social media.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.240
 And, you know, you can be sitting around the kitchen table,

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.240
 and, you know, people are all texting different people,

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.240
 or looking at the news, or whatever,

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.240
 and that's a lack of mindfulness to me.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.240
 So, I mean, when we talk about the intoxication,

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.240
 I think all of that, you have to step back and say,

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.240
 "What is it that I'm doing right now?

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.240
 Is it taking me away from the present moment,

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.240
 and from the love and compassion?"

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.240
 You know, because technologies can do that to us.

01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.240
 That's true. That's really true.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.240
 Therefore, I think, again, I mean, technology is so good,

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.240
 as you said, many levels are really good.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.240
 But in some other levels, also, it's really very disturbances.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.240
 It's disturbances, it's complicated.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.240
 This is what the Buddha teaching said,

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.240
 like, "Poured by the speech, one is gossip."

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.240
 So, I thought gossip is not just only verbal gossip,

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.240
 it's also gossips of the "I," "I" visual,

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.240
 and then the smell, the taste, or really gossip.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.240
 So, I think, also, watching so many times on the television,

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.240
 or the movie, or the YouTube, is really like gossip.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.240
 It distracted completely that.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.240
 And so, therefore, borderline is what?

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.240
 I think it really is good to mindfulness, the balance.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.240
 Mindfulness, not too much.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.240
 A little bit is good, but too much is what they call here.

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.240
 Too much is too much.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.240
 And it really becomes, like, just distracting everything.

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.240
 Even the premier closeness, again, I heard that,

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.240
 is really this modern technology, watching the movie,

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240
 watching the telephone, and watching,

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.240
 is just that bond of the family member,

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.240
 and the loved ones is also kind of exploding by these things,

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.240
 and just everyone is kind of, like, completely hooked in

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.240
 to that phone, or that computer, or that television,

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.240
 and then the rest is completely kind of ignored.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.240
 And there's so many other things happening,

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.240
 and beautiful things. So, therefore, as you said, it's true.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.240
 Really, I think it's just like moderation,

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.240
 and balance, and mindfulness is always important.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.240
 Okay?

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.240
 Yeah, okay.

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:54.240
 Your answer just now really feeds into the question I have.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:02.240
 If detachment is really not a struggle for you

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.240
 when it comes to family members, loved ones,

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:10.240
 possessions, material objects,

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:19.240
 if for you it's easy to walk away and let go,

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.240
 it, for me, kind of feels like a good thing,

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.240
 but there seems to be a lot of judgment surrounding it

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.240
 as if that makes you a cold, uncaring person

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.240
 when it's completely the opposite of what you really

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.240
 are trying to express.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.240
 The intention is loving compassion,

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.240
 but it's like if you're not overly emotional,

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.240
 then they think you don't care.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:52.240
 So then maybe you have to act as you want to.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.240
 That's it. As we talk, as we talk,

01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.240
 I mean, the Buddha says everything is magic,

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.240
 everything is magic, so you should perform the magic

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.240
 of acting, of the emotion, but not emotion.

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:10.240
 And you can do that really is good.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.240
 That's really good.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.240
 That's it.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.240
 That's it.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.240
 That's it.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.240
 That's it.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:20.240
 That's it.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.240
 Yeah?

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.240
 I think.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.240
 Excellent.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.240
 And not, I mean, you're not completely kind of,

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.240
 like emotion can't push you down with that emotion,

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.240
 but you're so strong and kind and accomplished,

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.240
 because when you're acting that emotion,

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.240
 that is activity of compassion.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240
 Completion, right?

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.240
 It's just a kind of mingle with them.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.240
 And then help as much as you can.

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.240
 Help with that, and without too much grasping.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.240
 As you said, it's not too bad.

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.240
 But then, wonderful, I think.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240
 Thank you.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.240
 We'll start with your talk, and then we'll come back.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.240
 What?

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.240
 We'll come back.

01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.240
 Let it break.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.240
 Five minute break, if you like it.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.240
 Then we go over.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.240
 We're going to go over a little bit the Mahayana

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.240
 and the Vedayanas.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:08.240
 Vedayana.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240
 Thank you.

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.240
 Thank you.

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:11.240
 Thank you.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.240
 Thank you.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.240
 Thank you.

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.240
 Thank you.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.240
 Yeah, five minutes.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.240
 Five, 10 minutes.

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.240
 Five minutes.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.240
 Yeah, five minutes.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.240
 Five minutes.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240
 I'm so sorry.
