00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
 Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I'm sorry that we're late today, but anyway, thank you very

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.480
 much, everyone.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.720
 And thank you for participating, everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.440
 Before we begin the session, we do again just a few minutes of silence meditation.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.160
 And then we begin with the lineage prayers that I think many of you all have started with the seven

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.080
-line prayers.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.840
 So thank again your participation and as well as your enthusiasm. Thank you.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 Trash delays. Now we do short silence meditation.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 Thank you.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 Thank you.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:24.170
 Okay, thank you, everyone. Now we begin seven-line prayer. If you have this booklet, this open

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.640
 prayer booklet is paid 14 of those people who need this booklet, seven-line prayers.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 Again, of course, every practice, when we do in the Buddha teachings or teachings of Gungarupi Maas

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:51.770
ambhavam, always reflecting joy and appreciation, and then devotion and bodhicatam, and all those so

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.120
 important to activate our good qualities of the inner natures.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.000
 And we are opening the door of our goodness. So, therefore, again, we activate the joy and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.710
 appreciation, devotion, bodhicatam, feel strong presence of Gungarupi Maasambhavam, and all lineage

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.880
 masters, then we do these practices.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.730
 And then we also follow the teaching according our capabilities, or maybe I should say according my

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.880
 capabilities, our sambhala teachings, according to the teachings of the great Master, His Holiness

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.640
 of the Nirvana, and then so that's what we do.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:51.360
 So please, again, reflect with our beautiful motivations.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:35.680
 (Singing)

00:04:35.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 (Singing)

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:33.760
 (Singing)

00:05:33.760 --> 00:06:02.800
 (Singing)

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:31.840
 (Singing)

00:06:31.840 --> 00:07:00.880
 (Singing)

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:29.920
 (Singing)

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:58.960
 (Singing)

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:22.000
 (Singing)

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.010
 Now we do the page 20, but we're not usually we insert some lineage prayers. And today, I don't

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.580
 think we're going to insert those. So we're going to straight through the, as this booklet, this

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:44.540
 time, as this booklet that was more simple, next time, then when we meet again, then maybe if you

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.040
 have that copies, and we will do all that, okay.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.370
 All the lineage prayers that were, we usually insert with the right after this page 20, before the

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.080
 page 21.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:21.120
 (Singing)

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:46.160
 (Singing)

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:56.160
 (Singing)

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:18.160
 Now we do the reggae subtle mantra three times.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:30.160
 (Singing)

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:39.090
 This individual who needs the spray of mantra of reggae subtle is in page 76 of this booklet, page

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.160
 76.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 (Singing)

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:48.160
 (Singing)

00:11:48.160 --> 00:12:10.160
 (Singing)

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:18.160
 Now, go back to the page 24, start the mandala offering and recurse the teachings.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:57.160
 (Singing)

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 Go back to the English.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:27.520
 According to the wishes of the sentient beings, their capacities for the high and the low, common

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:38.160
 and common weaker, please turn the wheel of Dharma.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 (Singing)

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:31.160
 (Singing)

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:59.160
 (Singing)

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:27.160
 (Singing)

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:55.160
 (Singing)

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:23.160
 (Singing)

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:51.160
 (Singing)

00:16:51.160 --> 00:17:19.160
 (Singing)

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:47.160
 (Singing)

00:17:47.160 --> 00:18:03.160
 (Singing)

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:11.390
 Again, thank you very much everyone for participating, and again, I'm sorry it will be late, but

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:18.160
 this time, actually what we're going to do, I'm going to go over the teaching of the great Master,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:27.180
 His only Dhanjung Rinpoche, which is known as the heart advice for the 14th ones, by His only Dhanj

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.160
ung Rinpoche, so heart advice for the 14th ones,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:38.800
 and together with the healing practices, this time is a very difficult time in the whole world

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.160
 experiencing different things.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.730
 I thought if we do this also healing practice, which is part of our bodhicata practices, part of

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:53.160
 our essential practices, actualizing bodhicata practice, not just wishing bodhicata,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 so which is a layout by all these great lineage masters thought to do those healing practices.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:10.340
 So, that means that I'm going to talk again of this teaching, what I'm referring to his own Dhanj

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.160
ung Rinpoche teaching, short time, but also what I'm going to do, not just go through fast this

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.160
 teaching,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:22.390
 I'm going to also slowly little bit and try to explore the meaning of the great teacher of bodhicak

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:29.160
ya manis, teaching of bodhicakya mani, so that we can observe in our heart and mind.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.800
 Many of you already know Buddhism, I'm sure you've studied so much, and some of those you don't may

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:43.490
 be so familiar, some really contribution for particularly those who don't know very much, we're

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.160
 exploring now.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.160
 And those individually who knows already, it is reminding.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
 What in the Buddha teaching said?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:20:00.360
 Studying, contemplations, not just hearing sometimes and then understanding kind of like as

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.160
 intellectually and leave that.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:11.160
 We have to observe that what we studied, what we did intellectually, analyze it to our heart,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.160
 and then get the fruit result.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:24.160
 As old as our great master's, lineage master's, they achieve that goal by doing, studying,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 contemplating and meditating practices,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:37.960
 with the endeavors or joyful effort, with joy, in appreciation, in bodhicata, with the determin

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.160
ations.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 That's really what they activated.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.160
 I would like to become one of those great master's in the world.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.160
 We always hear, we always talk.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.160
 That's the only way.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.160
 Studying, contemplating practices, observe to the heart.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:06.160
 So therefore, this round I'm going to go slowly at magic and explore the meaning of the words.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.160
 In order to do that, again, we begin always in the teachings of the great master's.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.160
 Always, we correct the motivations.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.160
 Motivation is foundation.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.160
 Motivation is mind.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.160
 Mind is invisible that we know.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:35.160
 We all know we have the mind, but nobody, even one's own self, we don't see our mind.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160
 How is invisible?

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 Behind the scenes.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.160
 But behind the scenes, this mind is ruling our every activities.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160
 What that means?

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:53.160
 Activity of samsara, activity of nirvana, activity path to the nirvana.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:22:00.160
 Everything is ruled by this unvisible, behind the scenes, powerful mind.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160
 And who can control, who can do this correct way?

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.160
 Nobody else can do except one's own self.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.160
 Individually, we can direct the mind even though it is invisible.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:26.160
 Invisible mind will direct the invisible mind as like homopedic techniques.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.160
 Others cannot do, no matter.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.160
 Even the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, himself said,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:41.990
 "I can show you the techniques, but once you have got the techniques and the teachings, then it's

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.160
 up to you."

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160
 You have to put hands.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.160
 Nobody else is going to do for us.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160
 We are going to do ourselves.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:58.660
 So, that means we have to take full responsibility of our destinations and our identities, our

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.160
 qualities.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.160
 And therefore, motivation is the foundation.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.160
 And that is what? What kind of motivation this time?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.160
 As, of course, you all know.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 Joy and appreciation.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.160
 And these three motivations.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.160
 Joy and appreciation as one guru.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:25.160
 And vidhi, second is bodhicata and third is purity, realizations.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
 Purity, understanding.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.160
 Those three motivations.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.160
 It's all mind.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160
 It's all mind, but slightly different.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.160
 Mind is rich of all everything.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.160
 Our mind is invisible.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 Even though we don't see, we can't detect exactly that the mind is full of the richness.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 And full of everything, actually.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:00.160
 So, this time we are going to revert the richness of our goodness, the treasures.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.160
 And that means, when we revert this, what is going to be?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:15.200
 As happy, more peaceful, more calm, more soothing, more down to the earth, more humble, humble,

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.160
 more humility.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 Really, then we can see the goodness around us.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.160
 Prison time, many times, we don't see our goodness around us.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:37.160
 We always focus one direction with narrowly and ignore the 99% or maybe 85 or 7%.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 But when you begin to settle down on our own goodness naturals, then when you look around,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.160
 the beauty will shine.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.160
 The infinite, endless goodness really will shine.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.160
 And therefore, again, to do that is the mind.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.160
 Every teaching said, all the great masters said, so therefore, joy and appreciation.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.550
 Even though we have the other difficult troubles, there is a lot of reasons to feel happy and joy,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.160
 ourselves.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.160
 And particularly in the Buddha teaching, to be as a human being.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.160
 As a human being is very, very special.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:23.160
 It's not just a quote, it's insignificant or insignificant, not casual.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:31.160
 These persons, our human body is so special, really so powerful, so special.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.160
 And to feel happy and joy, we've got one of our beautiful lives, and we are beautiful human beings.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:45.160
 Therefore, we get acknowledgement and have some courage and commitment, determination,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.160
 that I'm going to use my beautiful life, something for the good purposes.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:57.160
 That would benefit to me, my family, my friends, my loved ones, all the everyone.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 That is the way to start with joy and appreciation.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.160
 Then in the greatest teachings, the Buddha Kya Kya kyamuni, essential teachings,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160
 it's the Bodhi jata you all know, that we know.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.160
 I mean, not just you know, I know, I heard, I mean, I heard, you heard.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.160
 We all heard Bodhi jata.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:20.160
 Love and kindness, compassion, we combine, we worship them, worship them to all the living beings.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.160
 Really thinking that.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.160
 Today we are gathering and going to reflect and activate my understanding of the Buddha teaching,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 in the teaching of Gharipam and Samba.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160
 I've got to benefit all beings.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.160
 Those are the teachings said, if you do that, that becomes more powerful.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:43.160
 It's more powerful to help others, also more powerful to help ourselves,

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.160
 to deepen our realization and bring the growth.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 And purify some really of those unwanted, unnecessary obscurations,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.160
 habit patterns in the teaching set.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.160
 It is really wonderful spiritual.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.160
 Then, together with that, with purity understanding.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.160
 Why I am talking the purity understanding or realization?

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 Because according to Vajrayana teaching, that many, we all practice Vajrayana teaching.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.160
 What Vajrayana teaching said?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.160
 Entirely universe is enlightened status.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.160
 All the forms are enlightenment forms.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.160
 All the sounds are enlightenment songs.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.160
 Mind and spaces are enlightened.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.160
 See that.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.160
 And then in some more kind of detail level, Vajrayana teaching said,

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.160
 five aggregators are five Dhyana buddhas.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.160
 Five elementals are five female buddhas.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.160
 Everything!

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:55.160
 In the teaching, even Gharipam and Samba, even Buddha is his enlightenment,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.160
 or Buddha's his or his enlightenment.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.160
 Looking to everywhere, if there is something impurity,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.160
 they are never going to find.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 That means everything is enlightened.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.160
 Originally enlightened.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.160
 Not publicly enlightened.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 Already purity status.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 Why we don't see, like such as us.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.160
 Why we don't see?

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.160
 Because we have the cataracts of the duality mind.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 Duality, ignorance.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 It is a cataract.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.160
 It is blocked, shield.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 Who created that?

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.160
 By our self.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.160
 We created the cocoon, like cataracts.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:50.160
 Shield every of our directions and block our beauties.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:58.160
 And when we release, remove that cataract of the duality and obscurations.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.160
 Then enlightenment is here, according to the teaching.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160
 Right here.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.160
 According to teaching, according to the great masters.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.160
 According to that who got realizations.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.160
 Therefore, even those great masters, great practitioners,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.160
 looks like a peer.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.160
 They are going through so much difficult troubles and challenges,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.160
 all conditions.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.160
 But their heart is full of joy.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.160
 Full of appreciation.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:36.160
 They are singing the songs of how beautiful, how greatness, how wonderful.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.160
 Really, they are singing the songs.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.160
 You read those books.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.160
 So many books are now translated into English.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.160
 Of course, so many books in the tomatoes.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.160
 And many great masters see it.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.160
 They are just not pretending something.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.160
 Truly, seeing everything is in that ordinary purity status.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:04.160
 Truly, they see, five, I would get, get five dhyana buddhas.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:10.160
 Five elements are five female buddhas.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160
 That.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:18.160
 So, therefore, to activate that, we have to open the door right now.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.160
 Even we don't see exactly as that, but at least everything is in purity state.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:31.160
 Kind of leaning toward that purity, the ordinary state is our responsibility.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.160
 Our practices.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:39.160
 That's how we are going to open the true beauty of the enlightenment,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160
 or ordinary nature.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.160
 We use it as enlightenment, but according to the Buddha teaching, it is natural.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:55.160
 The ordinary nature is nothing more and less than the simple nature with things up.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:03.160
 For ourselves, we are completely covered up by the duality as cataracts.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.160
 I use the example.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.160
 Or we can use some other examples, but it shields up, covered up.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.160
 So, those are the reasons we practice.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.160
 With those beautiful motivation, now we go over this.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.160
 I went this teaching a while ago, last time.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.160
 We went this kind of way, mostly like some degree of this teachings.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.160
 But I thought, since it's so small, short, and I go over, really those what I went last time,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:40.800
 and maybe that way to explore a little bit more kind of, again, the meaning of these beautiful

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.160
 teachings.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.160
 And then, so, then we go what where we last time, we stopped.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.160
 That is more details.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:56.160
 First, this teaching is taught by his Holiness, Dunyur Rinpoche, in it's bed,

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.160
 because Chhabji, Dunyur Rinpoche.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.160
 And Chhabji is, what that means?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:13.160
 Supreme Lord or Supreme Protactors, from the samsara troubles,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.160
 or from the trouble of the negative emotions.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.160
 Therefore, this honor of a world, in it's bed world, Chhabji, Chhabji.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.160
 That is not just a kind of a personal title to his Holiness, Dunyur Rinpoche.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.160
 All the great Masters are named with that title.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.160
 Chhabji, this and that, then put the names.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 So, this time, Chhabji, Dunyur Rinpoche or Igni, his Holiness, Dunyur Rinpoche.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.160
 He was one of the great Masters in the 20th century.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:59.160
 Great Tirtum, the revealers, represented the origin of the Gaurabhammasambhavas.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.160
 Great scholars, great writers, great poetry.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.160
 But yet, he is so humble and simple, drawn to the earth.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:16.160
 And he is not showy, he is drawn to the earth, so humble, so simple.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:26.160
 His father, his husband, he was a father.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:32.160
 But yet, his realization, wisdom, is brilliant.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.160
 That you can feel, even though, through this category of duality in mind,

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:44.160
 you don't see, but you really can feel power, feel the energy,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.160
 the power of his enlightenment realization.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.160
 Those individuals who receive that, such as the great Master of that,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.160
 his time, all appreciated to him.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.160
 All those great Masters, really great practitioners,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.160
 appreciated of his realization, his wisdom, his fulfillment, who he was.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:18.160
 So this, he taught so many teachings, there is about 25 books are published now.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:24.160
 There is maybe more unpublished, but 25 volumes of the books are published.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.160
 And from that, this is one of those.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:32.160
 Simple, but very targeted, very simple, direct teaching.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:37.160
 Very simple way, as his Dunyur Madhyam Selmas, very simple person.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.160
 Simple, ordinary, talented earth, humble.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.160
 Really, I said, so beautiful, so spiritual, so beautiful.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:55.160
 His teaching, so here he said, he said, heart advice, from what?

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160
 That means what?

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.160
 From his heart, by what?

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:05.160
 With love and compassion, to all those beings who like to pursue,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.160
 pursue and discover, they enter the nature.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.160
 So that's what the title says here.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.160
 Heart advice to the 14 ones.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.160
 One, with the window is intubated, is not oscillated in English.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.160
 By my love, he said, with my love, I give this heart advice.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160
 Heart advice.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.160
 So in essence of the entire teaching of the Buddha Chakra Muni,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.160
 Buddha Chakra Muni gave teachings as you all know.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.160
 At 35 he started teaching, after his reaching enlightenment.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:51.160
 Until he entered Mahaparin Nirvana, at 81, 82, or 80, there's different versions,

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:58.160
 but he gave over 45 years non-stop teachings.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:06.160
 As an individualist and a student recorded their desire,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:12.160
 their capabilities, and their needs, Buddha gave those teachings.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.160
 Buddha's teachings are never overloaded or enforced.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:24.160
 Buddha's teaching is teaching of reason, teaching of the simple,

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.160
 teaching of common senses.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.160
 Buddha's teaching is known to the earth.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.160
 Very practical, very practical.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:41.160
 And there, Buddha himself said, I'm teacher, I'm simply teacher, nothing else.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.160
 I'm teaching what I realize, what I see, that I am sharing.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.160
 That's what Buddha said.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:55.160
 And in that way, Buddha become one of the great masters in this world,

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.160
 or great teachers in this world.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.160
 So that's what he's teaching.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.160
 And then, so this teaching encompasses really all the teachings.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.160
 Those teachings are known as Nayana teachings.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.160
 But all the teachings, generally in Buddhism, what I said,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:20.160
 can summarize down to the practical level, practical level, up to practice level.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:25.160
 I said, practice level, down to the three topics.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:32.160
 Every teaching can simplify down to the three simple practices.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.160
 Those teachings are known as, of course, you all know.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.160
 You all heard, I mean, including me, we all heard that.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.160
 What are those?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.160
 Those are known as morality teachings,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.160
 concentration teachings, wisdom teachings.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.160
 That's an entirely teaching.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.160
 All those 45 years' teachings can be summarized when you come to the practice,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.160
 when person practices these three.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:10.160
 Morality, concentration, and wisdom.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.160
 So this teaching encompasses all those teachings,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.160
 essential level.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.160
 Level, the teaching compasses the morality,

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.160
 the teaching compasses, it tells of the concentrations,

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.160
 it tells of the wisdom.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.160
 So this is the whole teaching of the Buddhas,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.160
 the condensed one, that came from the heart,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.160
 the loving heart, of the His only Benjur Rinpoche,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.160
 to the dedicated practitioners.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.160
 And this, of course, when he draw this to one individual,

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.160
 but this is not just only that individual, to all of us.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.160
 We are the 14 ones.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.160
 We have the beautiful, as a life of human beings,

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.160
 we are beautiful human beings.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.160
 We have the teaching, we have the capabilities,

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.160
 we have the opportunities, we have the freedom to practice.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.160
 Truly, we have, and we are also something to strengthen the knowledge

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.160
 and the wisdom to understand it.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.160
 Then, that is fortunate.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.160
 What else is?

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.160
 That is really truly fortunate.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.160
 But this fortunate one, we have to make more beautiful symbols.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.160
 We have to take this opportunity,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.160
 make something really even better, beautiful,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.160
 for ourselves, for all the beings.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.160
 So, that is really about the title.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.160
 And then, I think already I mentioned this,

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.160
 I don't know if I have to go over this.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.160
 Dedicated practitioners at Yangnaykub.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.160
 Yangnaykub is in Nepal, it is a place, a holy place,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.160
 where Guru Pia Masambhava practices the Vajrakalaya

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.160
 in the Yangdai Heruka, among at Heruka practices.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.160
 He practices, and in the teaching said,

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.160
 even though Guru Pia Masambhava is already enlightened beings,

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.160
 but he demonstrates by practicing of the Vajrakalaya

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.160
 and the Yangdai Heruka combined together,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.160
 he actualized of the Vidyadhara status

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.160
 or the Mahamudra status in the teachings.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160
 But he got enlightenment,

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.160
 who achieved the same as Vajrakalaya Realizations.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.160
 With the consult of Vasram Dakini,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:47.160
 known as Parmo-Hyakta Devi and Parabhinkala cities,

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.160
 two great Vasram Dakinis joined with him

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.160
 and practices on Vajrakalaya and the Yangdai Heruka

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:03.160
 combined together and actualized Realizations of that.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.160
 So that place, Yangnaykub is in Tibet, called Yangnaykub.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.160
 You consider it one of the very holy spots

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.160
 in Vajrayana Buddhism or Tibet Buddhism.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:22.160
 So, there is a practitioner, known as the second time,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.160
 who said that Cardin Dhava, who is disciple of his Holiness,

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.160
 as well as his Holiness, Chabjay Chaddar Rambochana.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.160
 Maybe you heard his name.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.160
 He was one of the great, really, masters in the 20th century,

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.160
 in the 21st century, and he has such a long life.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.160
 He stayed over a hundred years,

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.160
 and he was completely non-vegetarian.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.160
 What's the question? I'm using the wrong word.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.160
 He is completely vegetarian.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.160
 Vegetarian and the proof of the alcohols

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.160
 and smoking, all those are really kind of highlighted,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.160
 like, ethics of his old disciples.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:18.160
 No meat, no alcohols, no smoking, or any of those things.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.160
 So, that's the reason.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.160
 And then he rinsomed this great Chaddar Rambochana.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.160
 I think it's millions of the animals he released.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.160
 Millions, I think.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.160
 So, he was his student, too, as well as many others,

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.160
 such as his Indian Chantal Rambochana, all that.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:45.160
 So, then he told this slide.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.160
 So, then he chose it.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.160
 And so, fortunately, that who passed, that gave that.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.160
 So, I gave this instruction from love, from my heart.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.160
 I mean, he said that, even that.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.160
 Now, so, up to that, three lines is, in a way,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.160
 the beginning of this how, the layout of how,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.160
 why his own dungeon was a condensant to give it teaching,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.160
 because this Dawa, Kaddi Dawa, the fortune name Dawa,

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.160
 is a very dedicated practitioner.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.160
 He thought he needed more simple to put it in the practice,

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.160
 simple teaching to put it in the practice.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.160
 Therefore, he gave these teachings.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.160
 And now, the teaching itself.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.160
 Now, what begins?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.160
 Four lines, say here, to take full advantage of life,

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.160
 that is so difficult to obtain,

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.160
 or so difficult to obtain,

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.160
 and to resolve it to the pre-sansal,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:55.160
 from the ocean of the samsara, of suffering.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.160
 So, those, then, from here, begins the teachings.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.160
 Now, the first one, what is said here,

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.160
 to take full advantage of the life,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.160
 that is so difficult to obtain.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.160
 According to Buddha's teaching,

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.160
 according to Buddhism,

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.160
 the life what we have now, such this kind of life,

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.160
 is really difficult to obtain, difficult to obtain.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.160
 Why? It needs so much perfect cause,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.160
 and so many conditions.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.160
 And to come together,

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.160
 the cause and the condition is not always easy.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.160
 So, that means that if something, there is a good result,

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.160
 there is something that we see,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.160
 it has so many beautiful, it has beautiful cause,

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.160
 but it has so many beautiful conditions,

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:02.160
 supported to have this teaching, to this life.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.160
 It is very, very special.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.160
 And what in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:20.160
 said, as total, blind total, wandering in the ocean,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.160
 and this is just an example, it is not something that has happened,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.160
 it is not just a story of that, but there is one total,

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.160
 and his lifespan is so many,

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.160
 so many, like a thousand years, if that happens.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.160
 And he is wandering in the ocean,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.160
 that means from east to the west, to the south, to the north,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:50.160
 just wandering, third. And in that ocean,

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.160
 there is a yoke, Y-O-K-E, yoke.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.160
 Yoke is flowing on that ocean,

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.160
 and carrying by the wind, wherever wind blows,

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.160
 blows comes, go in that direction.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.160
 And wind comes from the east,

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.160
 that yoke is carrying, blowing to the west,

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.160
 or from north to the south.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.160
 I mean, again, it is just floating, floating.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:28.160
 And this total never had the intention to go,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:33.160
 go and catch the yoke, never had the intentions.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:42.160
 And no, yoke, not waiting, somebody will catch yoke, floating yokes.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:50.160
 But in a hundred years, that yoke comes once and out of the surface,

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:54.160
 surface, one hundred years, that has used examples.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:47:00.160
 And then when it comes, one time, the yoke,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:08.160
 the whole of yoke, yoke, when the turtles come up his neck,

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.160
 and it just went in, whole of the yoke.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:21.160
 How sudden that is? How sudden is this?

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:27.160
 In the Buddha teaching, the priest is alive, is even more sudden

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:32.160
 than the head of the turtle up to a hundred years coming

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.160
 to the whole of the yoke.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:42.160
 Entering, entering the head of the yoke in the whole of the,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.160
 sorry, entering the head of the turtle, sorry,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.160
 entering the head of the turtle,

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:57.160
 the head of the turtle is entering the, in the whole of the yoke.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.160
 It is even more, that is so sudden.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.160
 But even our life is more sudden, more precious.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.160
 Really in the teaching, see it, see that.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.160
 But that is teaching, like, I mean that is teaching,

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.160
 a coded teaching and a scientific also.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:23.160
 Really I saw, maybe quite a while ago, mentioning that they say,

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.160
 the Buddha teaching said those, but when you examine

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.160
 how our self is concepted in Mother's womb,

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.160
 they see, it is amazing, it is just something marvelous happened.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:43.160
 Otherwise there is so many hindrances, obstacles to conceiving that.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.160
 The poem that they share, those stages, different stages,

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:54.160
 really scientific research, evidence guided and so,

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.160
 that is something kind of amazing, you see it.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.160
 So that means that this has so many cause and conditions,

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.160
 so many cause and the conditions.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.160
 Conditions come together about this life.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.160
 Therefore, in the Buddhism teaching always it,

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.160
 the spiritual life of our self, what we have is,

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.160
 18 endowments at freedom, 10 luxuries.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.160
 And you all know those, I am not going to elicit that.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:30.160
 That is so special, at freedom and 10 luxuries.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:35.160
 Particularly well we are practicing, meditating, activating,

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.160
 we have full 18 endowments.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.160
 We may miss the place, decrease the practice,

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:49.160
 maybe then our 18 endowments, particularly those luxuries, 10 luxuries, decreasing.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.160
 Decreasing is fluctuating that.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:50:00.160
 But when we are practicing and activating full bloom with our at freedoms,

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.160
 then truly we have the 18 endowments.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:11.160
 We can observe ourselves how much luxuries we have, 10 luxuries.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.160
 Again, I am not going to elicit those, you know already we did before

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:20.160
 and so many books they are available and so you know that.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.160
 But there is 5 luxuries related with others, 5 luxuries related with ourselves,

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:33.160
 total 10 you can check up yourself how much luxuries I have.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:38.160
 Every of all 10 are intact, should be happy in joy,

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.160
 have more courage, more commitment that I am going to maintain this

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:49.160
 and I am going to make perfect benefit to myself.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.160
 Life is so precious, great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:50:52.160 --> 00:51:05.160
 life is in teaching said this is a boat, B-O-A-T boat to cross the ocean of the samsara.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:12.160
 This life is so precious, without this life or this precious human body

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.160
 we will not cross the ocean of samsara.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:22.160
 So therefore, take the full advantage, don't neglect this precious life

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:30.160
 or this opportunity is right our side, right our favor.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.160
 If some of you neglect it, then we are missing the point,

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.160
 truly we are really missing the point.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:44.160
 Therefore, take full advantage with the courage, commitment, same time

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.160
 pray to the Buddhas, Gaurabhema, Samba, Buddha, Dharma, Sanghas

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:56.160
 may I fulfill meaning of this my life to benefit to all the beings

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.160
 and to benefit one's own self.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.160
 Generally in the teachings when you benefit with other beings

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.160
 naturally it will benefit to you, to our self.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:13.160
 But pray, courage and commitment and determination

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.160
 combined together with prayers in both each other thought

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.160
 will make more secure to fulfill our wishes, our inspirations, that.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:35.160
 And so therefore, then in here teaching said here

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:42.160
 then here said, what is it, in the portal one, two, three, four, fifth line

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:51.160
 the resolve of the to free one's self from the ocean of samsara, samsara

00:52:51.160 --> 00:53:02.160
 and so this is now the resolve to free one's self from the ocean of the samsaras.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.160
 Here what I said in it a bit, so what I said the word samsara

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:17.160
 then and is like samsara and then ocean and then suffering

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:22.160
 so those are the highlight word and like to free or like to come out of this

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:29.160
 and this is generally now when gracious teacher Bodhacharya Kamuni reached enlightenment

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:38.160
 age 35 he turned well of Dharma which that we all know, know and I'm also

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.160
 it's not something that talking you don't know but I'm talking these things

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:51.160
 to also reactivate our appreciations to gracious teacher Bodhacharya Kamuni

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:57.160
 and all the lineage masters and in death sentence and then also reflection

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.160
 our memories as I said over our knowledge of the Buddha teachings.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:09.160
 Now the samsara when Buddha give the teaching what is it, this four noble truth the first

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:15.160
 among the four noble truth the teaching first it is what, suffering truth

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:29.160
 cause was suffering truth then second one is a sacred truth cause of a path truth

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:36.160
 sorry path truth so these those are the four noble truth.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:44.160
 Suffering truth cause of a suffering truth what is that, that is samsara

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:52.160
 suffering truth cause of suffering truth is a samsara and the sacred truth

00:54:52.160 --> 00:55:03.160
 and path truth is a nirvana sorry nirvana so samsara nirvana what it indicate

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:11.160
 directly this is samsara has a cause nirvana has a cause

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:20.160
 without the cause there is no samsara without the cause there is no nirvana

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:26.160
 and a lot more larger view of this teaching what in Buddhism known as

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:34.160
 dependent teachings interdependent teachings is interconnected teachings

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:43.160
 cause and the condition singly not producing but they are dependent to each other

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:50.160
 connected to each other then when is also that cause and condition is not just

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:58.160
 enough the right cause right condition need to produce so that means perfect cause

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:07.160
 if I use the word perfect conditions come together well produce the result

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:13.160
 whatever that may be it will produce whether that is samsara whether that is

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:22.160
 a nirvana without the cause and condition there is nothing well developed

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:28.160
 this is a great gracious kindness compared to teachers the hallmark teachings

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:37.160
 hallmark this is what known as interdependent or ting jai never nirvana in it a bit

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:44.160
 this teaching is really the core of all the great masters is extra only teachings

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:51.160
 teachings it is not that this cause is developing someone by someone else

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:57.160
 have to be a perfect cause that is not result is not coming without the cause

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:04.160
 without the conditions and the result is not developed by the that no cause no

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:12.160
 conditions and is not produced by someone else but just producing by its own self

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:19.160
 by those combination or that their activity that is known as the essential

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:25.160
 point of the ting jai never new so therefore this is like suffering truth

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:33.160
 cause of suffering truth that is samsara that is samsara

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:40.160
 and we don't like the suffering suffering then we should avoid cause of

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:48.160
 sufferings sufferings we know they're avoiding cause of suffering suffering

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:56.160
 will never stop because we create any suffering those samsara so that is a

00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:02.160
 samsara samsara is a Sanskrit word in the Tibetan called korwa and if it

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:14.160
 oscillated into English spanning spanning or rotating so that means what rotating

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:22.160
 rotate it to where to the six rams in the Buddha teaching said six rams

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:31.160
 what are those of course we all know hell rams hungry ghost rams animal rams

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:40.160
 human rams asura rams or demigod and God's the ram those are the six rams

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:50.160
 that that is those that that is those area we are roaming we are wondering

00:58:50.160 --> 00:59:01.160
 we're rotating who are wondering ourself our each of our individualist for those

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:06.160
 reasons in the Buddha teaching said we human beings or not just human sending

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:17.160
 beings named are like goer g-o-e-r I believe goer or the mover that's the name

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:25.160
 for all the beings because we never stays in one areas one place for long

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:33.160
 enough always moving larger level we are moving small level we are moving

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:40.160
 our mind is moving everything is moving our life is moving according to Buddha

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:46.160
 teaching life is also really moving and then to do all those different names by

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:54.160
 why we are wondering all those different names by once our own creations

00:59:54.160 --> 01:00:00.160
 that is known as then karma or our own activities are pushing come back wind

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:09.160
 are fluting our self as a york on the ocean surface of the samsaras all the

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:19.160
 time for that reason is the movers how long we're going to move this until we

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:29.160
 stop the cause and conditions there is no end if we don't stop there is no end

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:37.160
 every stop we have there is an end as I said who can stop not by Buddha not by

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:44.160
 not by all the great masters they give the teaching they give the instruction

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:52.160
 they give skills and methods all that but we have to do ourself we how we're

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:59.160
 going to do with courage commitment joy appreciation both each other that lined

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:08.160
 up our nature our nature what that mean nature of our mind nature of our mind

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:17.160
 in the Buddha teaching said is love is a compassion is a wisdom what we do now

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:24.160
 we doing opposite of that we doing opposite of love activity opposite of

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.160
 kindness of activity opposite the compassion activity we doing opposite of

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:36.160
 the wisdom activities then is samsara we creating samsara

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:43.160
 our self we're creating samsara nobody else creating samsara and overloaded us

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:51.160
 so therefore we have to stop stop so that is really samsara samsara and

01:01:51.160 --> 01:02:00.160
 the suffering is a suffering truth again it comes later too so I won't go over

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.160
 this more it later is coming too but samsara has no end of the difficulty in

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.160
 the challenge challenge in the troubles even though there is ourself as like

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.160
 beautiful life and all that but underneath is always something happening

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.160
 there is is really orbit this just a samsara in the teaching said so is not

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.160
 something but the samsara this trouble in what we have in human realm is so

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.160
 important in the teaching said is so good and we have the courage and

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:42.160
 commitment confidence this is reminding us to change the direction really is

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.160
 reminding many times for example according to the teaching God's realm is

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:53.160
 so fragile and happy in the peace they never pay any attention of the of the

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:59.160
 underneath ground and hell realm is so much troubles or the lower realm is so

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.160
 much trouble constantly so much trouble they don't have any time to think of

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:11.160
 that but we human realm has a mixture good and bad is really so good to bounce

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.160
 bounce up our courage and commitment reminded to our determination and also

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:24.160
 someday we know what trouble is and we know what happiness is happy we have

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:31.160
 this thing that the kind of the variety of this choice that makes so strong and

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.160
 so special is so therefore this human realm is a for that reason Buddha

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.160
 teaching what is a land of opportunities this is the opportunity you can make the

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:48.160
 change you can make the direction wherever you like to go you can you can

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:55.160
 make your own destination that's testing that's natural so therefore it is so

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:02.160
 so special special soul and there so those are my really brief talk today

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.160

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.160

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.160
 more really free and more technology is now we are really moving to the 21st

01:05:53.160 --> 01:06:03.160
 space of the technologies and all this the modern facilities we're using

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:09.160
