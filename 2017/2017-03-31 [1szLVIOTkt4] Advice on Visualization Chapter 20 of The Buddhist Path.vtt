NOTE     "synopsis": "Main Topics Being Discussed\n \n1. \"Sometimes when students are learning to visualize they find it difficult to maintain the visualization. Since the meditation deities are displays of primordial wisdom, their images are not solid objects. For instance, Guru Padmasambhava manifests in many different ways; his form and color are not definite. Sometimes Guru Padmasambhava might transform into a small bird who is singing outside your window. Sometimes he appears and sometimes he disappears. When his body of primordial wisdom disappears, you should not worry that you have lost touch with him; continue your meditation so that Guru Padmasambhava will come back again and again and become more clear.\" (pg 97, 1st paragraph)\n\n2. \"They began walking and after a few steps the yogi stopped and said, 'You must remember all the advice I have given you. You must have constant, pure devotion and continue to pray to Guru Padmasambhava. Always follow the instructions I gave you today.' Then, he gave a few hints to show that he was Guru Padmasambhava. He did not say, 'I am Padmasambhava,' but he gave some hints. Then, he pulled a small horn from his chuba and blew it in different directions. The moment he did that, he disappeared. When Ratna Lingpa saw that the yogi had disappeared, he thought that maybe the yogi was a magician and that the rolled paper he had placed on his shrine would be gone. He ran inside to check, and saw that the paper was still there.\n After his meeting with the yogi, Ratna Lingpa's whole demeanor and outlook changed. He was always very happy and his mind remained in the natural state.\" (pg 100 last paragraph, pg 101 1st and 2nd paragraphs)\n\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nconcentration [Tib. ting nge 'dzin; Skt. samadhi]. Concentration is one of the themes of the paramitas and the Noble Eightfold Path taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, which can be divided into teachings belonging to three categories: (1) shila [tshul khrims], ethical conduct; (2) samadhi, concentration associated with meditative equipoise; and (3) prajna [shes rab], transcendent wisdom. The Sanskrit word samadhi can be defined as \"undistracted concentration,\" mental focus,\" \"meditative stabilization,\" \"meditative absorption,\" \"contemplation,\" \"total involvement,\" \"undividedness,\" and others. By cultivating concentration, we develop the power to bring the mind into a state of clarity and equanimity. The three categories of concentration are (1) worldly concentration, (2) concentration that goes beyond the world, and (3) concentration that benefits others. In the context of Vajrayana, concentration can refer to either the creation stage or the completion stage.  (Liberating Duality with Wisdom Display: The Eight Emanations of Guru Padmasambhava, pg 154)\n\ncreation stage visualization [Tib. bskyed rim]. One of the \"two stages,\" the other being the completion stage. The creation stage is related to Mahayoga, in which everything is seen as the indestructible body, speech, and mind of enlightenment, or the \"three vajra states.\" Creation stage practice can be generally divided into: (1) visualization and (2) mantra recitation. After we establish the visualization of the deities, we recite their mantra. In Vajrayana, when we visualize our environment and ourselves as enlightened, we're bringing out our inner, self-born awareness wisdom without being disturbed by duality and habitual patterns. We're discovering the splendid qualities of our inner primordial wisdom, which then shines out through our body and speech. Our body becomes primordial wisdom form and our speech becomes primordial wisdom sound. When the sunlight of our inborn nature of primordial wisdom shines through our speech and body, we're inseparable from Guru Padmasambhava. In fact, we are Guru Padmasambhava. Our nature of self-born wisdom awareness is absolute Guru Padmasambhava.\" (Liberating Duality with Wisdom Display: The Eight Emanations of Guru Padmasambhava, pg 154-5)\n\n\nPBC YouTube Videos of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches for Further Study \n \nWhy We Visualize in Tibetan Buddhism\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_d_81dwm6c\n\nOn April 17, 2012, during the one month Dzogchen retreat at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche gave an amazing teaching on why we use visualization in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\nThree Essential Qualities of Vajrayana Meditation\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-HbT7dJKWY\n\nOn July 26, 2010 at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche taught about the three essential qualities of all Vajrayana meditation practices:\n(1) clarity, (2) purity, and (3) stable confidence.\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 Welcome to the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group from Padmasami Ling, Venerable Camperomchis Monastery

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.440
 and Retreat Center in New York. Today we're discussing their book, "The Buddhist Path",

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.920
 we're specifically looking at Chapter 20, called "A Device on Visualization".

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.080
 So we'll begin with our usual opening prayers and then we'll begin the discussion today. Thank you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:55.040
 [Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.040
 [Music]

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 [Music]

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 [Music]

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 [Music]

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 [Music]

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 [Music]

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:11.040
 [Music]

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:29.040
 [Music]

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.440
 So Chapter 20 begins on page 97, "Advice on Visualization". I'll give a quick summary of just the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.040
 first couple paragraphs of the chapter.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 The Venerable Camperomchis begin by saying that for many people it is difficult to maintain

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.040
 visualization in creation stage Vajrayana practice.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.040
 Meditation deities are displays of primordial wisdom, our own natural awareness. They're not solid

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.040
 or fixed in any way, since your primordial mind is not solid or fixed in any way.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.440
 Just keep practicing according to the instructions and gradually your visualization will become

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 clear.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.510
 The famous Turtan Minyar Dorje gave advice on visualization practice, saying that Guru Padmasambh

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.040
ava did not always look the way the paintings and statues depicted him.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.500
 He can appear in any way that is helpful to others, so we should not only expect him to appear or

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 behave in only one way, according to our limited conceptions.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.990
 There's a famous story about Guru Rinpoche's unrestricted appearance and activities that involves

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.310
 the great Turtan Ratna Lingpa. Andrew will briefly summarize this story and then we'll discuss the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.040
 first topic point.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.310
 So in this chapter, Rinpoche explained that Ratna Lingpa was a famous Turtan who lived in the 15th

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 century, born amidst many different signs and special indications that he was a special child.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.040
 He grew up, got married, and lived as a householder.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.610
 One day in Tibet, as was common at the time of the village, Ratna Lingpa and many other people were

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:12.040
 having a party, but they did archery, singing, dancing, drinking, the Tibetan beer, chong.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.770
 So they had a great time. The party went on into the night. Ratna Lingpa, the next day, took his

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.040
 animals out to pasture.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:34.510
 And at that time he had obtained a text, a special biography of Guru Padmasambhava by Nyangran Nima

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.100
 Ozer, which he was copying the text because he wanted to use part of the special prayer from that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.040
 text in his daily practice.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.040
 So he was really tired from all the partying the day before. He fell asleep.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.430
 And when he woke up, he felt really fresh and joyful and there was an old man standing in front of

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.040
 him who had yellow cotton robes on.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.040
 So he said, "How could this man be here?" It's almost like he appeared from nowhere.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.270
 But the man reached out and he picked up that text that Ratna Lingpa had been reading and said that

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.040
, "Oh, this is a biography of Guru Padmasambhava by the great Nyangran."

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.040
 "Do you have a special feeling of devotion towards Guru Padmasambhava?"

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.710
 And Ratna Lingpa said, "All my life I felt a special connection to Guru Padmasambhava and had all

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.040
 kinds of devotion. So that's why I'm copying this. I want to put that in my daily practice."

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.200
 So this old man said, "Oh, that's wonderful. You're good. This text is really good and you're quite

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.040
 good too."

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.040
 So he said, "Do you know where this mountain is around here?" The hovering mountain of the Garuda.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 And Ratna Lingpa said, "I don't know that one, but there's this Garuda mountain."

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.040
 And the old man in the yellow cotton robe said, "Oh, that's the one."

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.660
 So then he pulled out a special scroll, like a roll of paper from his chuba, and he gave that to

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.040
 Ratna Lingpa.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.310
 And he said, "Open this." And Ratna Lingpa read that, and it described Ratna Lingpa by name,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.040
 including even marks on his body for telling that he would be a great terminal revealer.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.040
 So Ratna Lingpa was so surprised. He said, "This can be about me." But it was.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.310
 So he was so happy. And he said, "Can I copy this?" And the old man said, "No, you keep that. That

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.040
's for you."

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.570
 So anyway, Ratna Lingpa invited this man to come have dinner because it was already midday by that

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.040
 time.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.450
 And the yogis stayed outside. He didn't come inside, but Ratna Lingpa gave him, you know, saba, ch

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.040
ang, tea, and meat and cheese.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.970
 And that man gave Ratna Lingpa many instructions about, you know, what was written on the scroll

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.040
 for telling his terminal revelations.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.370
 Then it was getting late. Ratna Lingpa said, "Oh, it's getting late, and you don't have hardly any

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.770
 dress on. Take my chuba, my new chuba, and you can stay here for the night because there's no

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.040
 village anywhere near here."

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:08.290
 And the old man said, "No, I'm fine. Where I'm going, I won't need this." Anyway, so the yogi, he

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.040
 left, and after a little bit the yogi told Ratna Lingpa,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.660
 "You should remember the advice well that I gave you, and remember that and practice that about,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.040
 you know, how you engage with those terminal revelations.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.650
 And maintain creative emotion, always creative Guru Pama Sambhava." Then he gave some indication,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.930
 like, through hints that he was Guru Pama Sambhava through different ways, but he didn't come out

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.040
 and say it straight away.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.210
 Then he pulled a small horn from his chuba, blew that in different directions, and then he just

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.040
 disappeared like that.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.430
 Ratna Lingpa was so amazed. He thought, "Oh, that scroll must have disappeared that he gave me, too

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.040
." So he ran inside, looked, but the scroll was still there.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.910
 Anyway, then ever since that happened, Ratna Lingpa, he felt so joyful devotion. His mind always

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.460
 kind of stayed in the natural state, and he had this whole radiance and the whole vibration of even

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.040
 his house had completely changed.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.800
 So that when his wife came home, she asked, "You look so white. You even look so shining, you know,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.040
 what happened? What happened?"

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.100
 And he said, he didn't really tell her because he'd been instructed not to reveal that for three

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.040
 years to tell, keep secret their meaning in that scroll.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.240
 But she kept asking, asking, so over time he said, "Here's what happened." And he was so happy, and

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.040
 so they both kept that secret for three years.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.870
 And then after three years when Ratna Lingpa, I guess, was about 27, he began to discover termless

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.040
 in many places.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.410
 So the point being that Guru Padmasambhava can appear in many different forms, even as a little old

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.040
 man wearing yellow cotton cloth.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:01.040
 If we go to the point, first point, which is page 97, the first paragraph.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.720
 "Sometimes when students are learning to visualize, they find it difficult to maintain the

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.040
 visualization.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 Since the meditation deities are displays of primordial wisdom, their images are not solid objects.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.970
 For instance, Guru Padmasambhava manifests in many different ways. His form and color are not

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.040
 definite.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:30.040
 Sometimes Guru Padmasambhava might transform into a small bird who is singing outside your window.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.040
 Sometimes he appears, and sometimes he disappears.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:41.230
 When his body of primordial wisdom disappears, you should not worry about that you have lost touch

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.040
 with him.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:49.160
 Continue your meditation so that Guru Padmasambhava will come back again and again and become more

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.040
 clear."

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.100
 So one thing that this reminds me of is that Kimbell is talking about how even if the visualization

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.040
 isn't clear,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.190
 that if you really keep that sense of the presence of Padmasambhava or whoever it is that you're

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.040
 visualizing,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:19.980
 and just keep that kind of heart connection with even just the essence of what the Buddha is, then

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.040
 that's good.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:33.040
 And then as he's saying here too, to keep trying, to keep trying to visualize.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.040
 There was one time when Lorraine and I were doing Chenrezig prayers together.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.040
 There was only one thing she said, like we were in the middle of the silence.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:51.110
 She must have noticed I wasn't meditating very hard, because she told me, "Feel the presence of the

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.040
 lineage.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.040
 Feel that presence and then you're right back to meditation."

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 That's very striking, I think particularly at the time.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:10.040
 It's amazing how particularly those small bits of pith advice, they snowball.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:20.040
 You kind of lose track of where the blessings really go to and what they make more profound.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.260
 I have a question in terms of just even, I'm someone who's always had a lot of trouble with

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.040
 visualization,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 and my visualization still is not really very clear.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:36.040
 I do rely on that presence and the essence of what the deity is about, tuning into that and trying

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 to be that.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.880
 I just wonder, what is the advice if you're someone who has a lot of trouble having a clear

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.040
 visualization?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:52.040
 What are the steps? What does one do?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:59.040
 Well, definitely what you said is, Rinpoche's voice said, that's really important.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:06.900
 Which of course includes our Boichita, our joy and devotion and all those kind of foundations of

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.040
 the practice.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:17.700
 And then maybe even within the visualization instruction, if you can even just focus on one part of

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.040
 it,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:30.040
 like just on Guru Pichay's smile or just on Guru Pichay's eyes or anything.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 That's definitely kind of something.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.350
 I think too, part of that part of feeling the closeness is also in a way just like, it's like

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.040
 feeling that presence and closeness.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.770
 And I don't know if it's that way for everyone, but it definitely seems like it just kind of opens

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.040
 up.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.040
 It's like we relax and sometimes almost by relaxing a little more.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:13:00.230
 And that kind of that feel, especially that closeness feeling in a way, the visualization can

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.040
 happen a little easier in a way.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 And then of course, there's also so many wonderful tankas and things like that.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.040
 Those can definitely be used as a support for that.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.330
 And sometimes just by gazing on the tanka and doing the meditation and knowing with these same kind

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.040
 of instructions

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:26.040
 that it's not a fixed substantially existing, but that is Guru Padma Sambha.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.040
 And the same too with our visualization, maybe what are we expecting?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.040
 You know what I mean? What are we expecting to see when we close our eyes and visualize?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:43.400
 I mean, we know, but also that part of keeping that constancy and following the instructions as

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.040
 best we can.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.330
 Seems Guru Pichay's always emphasized and with that closeness feeling, but also not getting too

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.040
 relaxed or too caught up on what we're not doing.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:03.040
 But that's what it seems like. And I'm sure there's other...

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.040
 Yeah, that's good. Yeah, it's really helpful.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.090
 Kind of going off what you were saying too with the tanka, I mean, I don't know if I consider this

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.040
 advice as much as anecdotal.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.790
 I noticed particularly when I started making soft-saws that my visualization really started to crit

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.040
ter.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.530
 Actually, sometimes the making of them, because I have to really inspect the detail of them through

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.040
 bubbles.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.520
 But also then when I had to start painting them, you know, because then I mean, particularly if it

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.040
's a complex look.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.040
 Oh yeah, I mean, because some of them, you know, you're bringing out the eyes.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.910
 There was one morning I spent four hours on one chin racing and every detail you're trying to

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.040
 really get it to pop and shine.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.040
 It was amazing because then, you know, you go to meditate later that day and you close your eyes

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040
 and boom, didn't have to work at it.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.040
 Because you just spent four hours like burning it into your retina.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:05.330
 So, you know, those kind of practices too, where you're in a situation where you really have to

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.040
 inspect, you know, things like that.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:13.040
 Which I'm not sure everyone's going to have the opportunity to make a sasa, though it's wonderful.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.660
 But, you know, any kind of way to really connect to really having or even I mean, I guess in that

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:28.030
 sense, even just inspecting that really noticing all the really intricate detail and really just

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.040
 really going over it.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:41.040
 You know that real attention to those depictions was really helpful for me.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:52.040
 Even in this, I guess, it's more advice that Guru Pama Sambala gave on visualization stage and this

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.040
 really amazing book, "Deity, Mantra, and Wisdom."

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.040
 It has three fundamental ningma texts by J.B. A. Lingpa, Pacha Rinpoche, and Getze Maha Pandita.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.720
 But anyway, in the back of that, there's some appendix and it has Guru Rinpoche's short, you know,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.040
 two pages of advice on visualization.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:19.040
 And that he says, for example, he says, "Look at the image continuously for a long length of time."

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.040
 Just kind of like what you said.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.020
 I mean, it's a specific instruction and it must be applied and you have to receive the instruction

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.040
 from the teacher.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.080
 But then he said, "Then close your eyes and immediately visualize that image or visualize yourself

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.040
 as that image."

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:40.240
 And he said, "Don't keep, if your visualization isn't more clear and it becomes dull, then don't

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.040
 meditate like that.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.040
 Then relax, open your eyes again and again, look at the image."

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.040
 Over and he just kind of repeated this and he said, "Do this for like three days."

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.040
 He said, "Do this over and over, continually doing this and interspersing with relaxation."

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.040
 And when you just let go of the visualization altogether.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:06.060
 But feeling that that presence, it's beautiful. I mean, if we had time, I think part of that too is

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.040
 really just shamatha.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:14.040
 You know, like developing some concentration, a little bit more mental quietude.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:20.040
 And then from that basis, engaging in the practice and then alternating like that too.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.170
 I mean, it depends on the proof of instructions like of Guru Rinpoche's or what practice you're

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.040
 doing.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.040
 That was his essential advice for meditation.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.040
 - Part of it. - Uh-huh, yeah.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.040
 Yeah, I particularly tune into what Maya was saying about just looking at one detail.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.240
 Because I think that might be part of what makes it hard for me is I'm trying to do a whole lot of

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.040
 detail at once.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.040
 You know, without actually, and I've heard that instruction or read that instruction too.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.040
 To start with the eyes, the eyelashes and the eyebrows and then add the nose.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.040
 Do you know what I mean? That you kind of really build it up by pieces.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.040
 And so then, you know, it's not like all of a sudden trying to do something totally complex.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:06.060
 It's just like, I mean, to me, even one figure, do you know what I mean, can be complex in terms of

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.040
...

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 Because there's that... Tennessee was so materialistic to think, well, it's not really there.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.040
 At least I'm that way. I'm very kind of specific type, you know?

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.040
 So it's like, it's not really there and some, you know, it's all vague and stuff, et cetera.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.040
 Yeah.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.040
 I'm trying to think how I would apply it to the visualization too.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:39.040
 I just remember particularly when I was getting trained in how to be able to hear a musical line a

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.040
 few times

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.040
 and be able to kind of regurgitate it.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.040
 One of the things that my teacher used to tell me, he would teach us how to memorize very quickly.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:52.530
 And one of the things he used to teach was, he called it chunking, where you essentially, you take

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.040
 something,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.040
 you start breaking it down into its component parts, but you start to recognize the pattern of it.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.040
 So, you know, like, he would take 10 intervals, you know, we'd have to memorize the 10.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.040
 He said, think of it in three parts, a three unit, a three unit, and a four unit.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:16.780
 It's the same way like a phone number is broken up. You have the blah, blah, blah, dash, blah, blah

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.040
, dash, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.040
 You know, kind of a thing.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.040
 So I guess for some visualizations, particularly I think kind of going back to that, you know,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.020
 you have certain details you focus on, you know, and then you kind of like, okay, now I can kind of

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.040
 pull those together.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.040
 Okay, now let me like look over here and let me, you know, get these together.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.040
 Okay, now I've got that, you know, kind of thing too.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.040
 I don't know. I mean, I guess like Andrew was saying before, it's, you know,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:50.040
 it comes down to what are the instructions that were given to the different particular students,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:59.040
 but just more method.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:10.420
 I'm doing great. I mean, there's one thing that struck me related to this visualization stage

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.040
 practice.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.440
 And I wrote it down and like it's really helped me for a lot, just even just to remember kind of

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.040
 the some main points.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.510
 And it's related to this video that I've come around the chase that's mentioned at the end of this

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.040
 study.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.170
 I mean, it was in the union of Mahamudra and Zochen and Kamaramache said, and I just have it

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.040
 written down,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 with Vashara pride and purity, while feeling the presence of all the Buddhas,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:42.770
 we will get the full result of the visualization practice, even if the visualization is not perfect

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.040
.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.200
 So again, it's with Vashara pride and purity, while feeling the presence of all the Buddhas, we

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.040
 will get the full result.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:58.220
 So then here, I think it lists these three parts that are mentioned in Kamaramache's teaching in

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.040
 that video.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.040
 And they're the same things we're talking about now.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.040
 And the first is this clarity part, where it is detailed as it can be the visualization.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.040
 And if it's not that detailed, it'll grow as we keep practicing.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.040
 But the main point, like Ann said, is to feel the presence of there is an actual Buddha there.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:25.040
 They're so happy you're trying to develop these qualities, but to really feel, to let yourself be,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040
 this is really real.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.040
 This is happening, you know.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 And then the second point was the purity of the Dapha in Tibetan.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.200
 And Kamaramache said that was like seeing the purity of the compassion, the purity of the wisdom,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.040
 and the purity that's beyond duality.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:48.130
 So since some, I think in Kamaramache's, the first great Kamaramache said the emptiness aspect of

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.040
 the visualization,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.170
 or here, like in the chapter of Kamaramache, they're saying that it's not solid, it's not fixed, it

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.040
's totally transcendental wisdom, rainbow light.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.930
 So to really feel it's there, but it's not there in any fixed structured way, it's totally flexible

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.040
, it's just luminous awareness, or this emptiness.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.040
 So we have like the detail, like something really there, but it's empty.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.040
 And then the third part is to like stably be with it.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:22.040
 So the third part is this stability, or tanka, I think, I remember what she said.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.040
 So it has to do with the shamatha, or the concentration, and also this Vajrapad component.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:35.500
 Like to be with it, and to be really convinced with it, to really fully settle into that, like the

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.040
 Vajrapad, this is actually the true nature, this isn't pretending or something.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.860
 So and then, Rinpoche in one sentence included those three points, which is beautiful, with Vajrap

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.040
ad and purity, while feeling the presence of all the Buddhas, we'll get the full result.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.530
 It's really beautiful, that's the emptiness part, it has the shamatha part, because we're

00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:01.330
 sustaining it as practice, and then we're really believing it, feeling it, like really being there

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.040
 with it.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:11.040
 That's very profound, those three points.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.520
 Because I think, like we've all been saying, I think the big obstacle that we face is, I can't do

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.040
 it well, you know? Like I can't visualize well.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.040
 So if we don't have the details, just like you're saying, you know?

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:32.020
 Even without that part, if we really feel the presence, like you said, and just also the two other

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.960
 parts, Rinpoche said, if the visualization's not clear, as long as we're really trying to connect

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.040
 with the emptiness, where's this coming from?

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.040
 It's not, you know, this is all mine.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:49.260
 And then secondly, the like to really stay with that, with confidence, then gradually, like the

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.210
 clarity, the detail will fill out, and the practice, the mind will sharpen those qualities, clarity

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:00.040
 will come more and more strongly and clearly.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.850
 I thought it's interesting too, how in this chapter, of course there's Rinpoche's have given so

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:14.080
 many instructions on visualization and things, but in this particular chapter, it seems like the

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:24.040
 emphasis is really on not, in a way, like not, like he talks about the little bird at your window.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.840
 That can be Rinpoche, and it's like, that's not what you're trying to visualize. It's not even so

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.040
 much, a lot of the chapter doesn't even talk about formal practice so much.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:41.250
 Just in that sense of how, maybe the way we, you know, the room we're sitting in, and the world

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:49.240
 that it is just like, our body as it is, like, even if we're not seeing it as like, you know, how

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.040
 it might be described in the text, or seeing Rinpoche as,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.230
 you know, as described in the text, but just that aspect of settling into the practice where, just

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:06.600
 knowing, and just, just like we know our heart is beating or something, you know, like, this is my

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:13.650
 body, you know, this is Rinpoche, even if, just feeling that, that, that, that part of the presence

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:21.040
, how it's like, everything that's appearing is kind of like, this pure land, even if it's, it's,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040
 you know,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:28.260
 we're not going to put any rules and regulations on how it's supposed to look, or sound, or smell,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:34.040
 or taste, or, you know, or, I mean, all those, like, that, that aspect of the practice.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:26:02.090
 And, and also like, here, where Rautna Linkpa wakes up, and there's, you know, this man who has so

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.200
 much to offer, you know what I mean? And, and he recognizes maybe later, Oh, that was Pabong Samb

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.270
aba, or that, you know, but that, but, but still he, he, he got a lot out of that, you know, he didn

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.040
't miss any kind of opportunity because, oh, it's just some old man, you know, something like that.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:11.480
 But, I mean, he took full, he really engaged, like, with what he was doing. I know that was just

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.240
 like, I just thought that was an interesting part, as far as this, what's in the book, under this

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.040
 title, you know, that it seems like it's that, like, we've been talking, and I think it's

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.040
 definitely interesting.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.080
 We talked more about, like, the, you know, different kinds of samadhi and concentration and the

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.450
 little points we've talked about, but I just thought it was really kind of interesting, like, that

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:42.630
 level kind of underneath all that stuff seems to be, Orimpa Shays are kind of trying to give it a

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:49.320
 sense of that, you know, they're not making a disconnect between what's appearing to us and what we

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.040
're meditating on in a way, I mean, without, you know,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 you know, that's great. It's like the little bird at the window. You think, oh, I'm distracted.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:12.040
 Yeah, but you know, I mean, not saying, yeah, that everything's included.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.040
 I think it really reminds me of that instruction. Sometimes people will say, such and such thing

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.700
 happened to me. How should I, is this a good sign or a bad sign? And then Orimpa Shays said so many

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.870
 times, if you're in a retreat environment, or if you're just really connecting to your practice,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.040
 you take everything as being a good sign.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:38.190
 Everything is an indication to go back to your practice, to keep going, keep going, keep going. So

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:44.500
 it's not like a little bird, if it becomes a reminder of connecting to your nature and really

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:51.240
 inspiring this genuine bodhicitta and this sense of like the fresh, joyful awareness and like then

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.040
 all these relative things,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.820
 all these changing things, if we can use them, whether they're difficult or not, to help us come

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:04.210
 practice, to help us remind us of what the whole, our trajectory, the path and like the point of

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.040
 the path, then it's beautiful.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.440
 I think it's so hard to do. I mean, it's just, maybe for other people, it's not, for me, it's hard

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.040
 to bring everything onto the path, you know, like that's really hard.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.060
 It was an instruction I remember reading early on. It was not here, but before here, that you like,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.430
 it might have been Thich Nhat Hanh, where he was, he was talking, but though he was talking about

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:35.260
 like introducing it very slowly, like, you know, when you hear like a telephone ring, you just, you

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.720
 habituate yourself to like every time you hear a telephone ring that you take that moment, stop,

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.030
 take three breaths, or I mean, in the case of telephone, sometimes we only have one or two breaths

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.040
 tonight.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:52.780
 But you know, in that same time, you know, it's, you use, you use that, that audio kind of signal

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:59.040
 to, you know, stop, breathe, oh, I'm here, hi, you know, kind of.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.830
 So I think, you know, if you, if you slowly add in those things, when you just, you use that as

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:10.600
 that reminder to even just stop, you know, it's, yeah, because I think it'd be really hard to, you

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.040
 know, particularly jump right into it and just, you know, feel it's particularly joyful about, you

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.040
 know, hearing a phone ring.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.040
 I know, I don't feel very joyful about hearing phone rings.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.090
 But, you know, it's sometimes you just even I remember I used to make a big point of that part,

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:35.030
 particularly because there used to be a lot of phones ringing, you know, stop, you know, it's much

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.040
 nicer.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:44.040
 And then of course, then you can build it up to to where else you need it to be.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:57.040
 You can even add more things here a toaster pop, you should breathe a lot more time with a toaster.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.040
 And it seems like, well, along those lines too, sometimes I can say he says something interesting.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:08.010
 He said you should change those frequently, because once your mind gets used to that, it just

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.040
 becomes same old, same old, and you kind of forget what the door opening means.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:27.230
 So continually switch it up so that your mind doesn't just routinely, normally go through its

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.440
 normal thing. But I found to like, one of the, how the foundation like what we were talking about,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.320
 like how Rinpoche is safe at the beginning of every teaching, which we've heard so many times,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.040
 which is the motivation being in the right place, you know, like bodhicitta.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:43.770
 And, you know, the two motivations, the bodhicitta and the skillful means of the Vajrayana, you

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:50.630
 know, the three Vajra states being like indispensable tools that really will aid our visualization

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:57.760
 practice, not only at the devotional level, which is the central key of all the practice in Vajray

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:03.040
ana, but even the level of clarity and visualization itself.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:10.040
 I remember the first, I think it was the first question I ever asked Rinpoche's during a teaching,

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:17.770
 and they were saying, visualize all sentient beings in front of all sentient beings in the tree,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:24.040
 and I was like, what are you talking about?

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:31.310
 I asked them that. I asked them that. I was like, Rinpoche's, you started by saying, visualize all

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:38.310
 sentient beings, and they just start laughing. They're like, they said, of course, it might be

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:45.240
 difficult at first to visualize all sentient beings, but they're like, this is a Mahayana we're

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.040
 practicing.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:52.060
 Mahayana means great vehicle. That means we include all sentient beings, at least in the mental

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:58.540
 level, and realize while you're practicing engaging in the visualization, you should really

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.040
 consciously include every single sentient being.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:10.830
 So even if you don't visualize all done immediately, but by including them, you will, your capacity

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:17.040
 to hold that will become more and more, and it will come more clear over time.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.720
 But anyway, just to come back to that essential point that whatever technique we're using, if that

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.040
's our motivation, it will work, you know, it will work.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.040
 And that's what Rinpoche say over and over again. I've heard them say so many times.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.340
 It's funny you mentioned that too, particularly looking back over that first topic point, because I

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:43.470
 remember I was sitting and meditating this morning and I was trying to try or a lot to try to

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.040
 expand that visualization.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:52.130
 And finally, remember to include the squirrels outside that kept eating that darn bird seed we kept

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.590
 putting out there so tricky, and they just get in there, throw the stuff so it's very hard to

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:01.040
 include them and feel compassion but I finally remember it this morning, because they're right

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.040
 there.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:10.430
 They're making a ruckus for sure. So then, you know, it's, it's good to not feel closed off just

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.040
 because they're eating all the bird seed.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.410
 And I think as all like everyone's saying and what why you seem to really be emphasizing is that, I

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:27.040
 mean, this is also, this visualization practices is, it's within the Vafriana view.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.040
 And in that view, at least according to the teachings, we're not like refusing our experience.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:40.270
 We're not only trying to consider certain times or certain states or certain experiences as being

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:46.390
 that's my practice or that's going to be okay or that's an actually a blessing and everything else

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:51.040
 isn't like we're trying to have that, like you said the second

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:57.730
 dimension of those three vajra states where it's, it's all flexible and it comes down to it at all

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:02.040
 our experiences all our thoughts and racing emotions like it.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:09.020
 Essentially, they're not our enemies. They're not these things we have to punish or get rid of or

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:15.920
 just blindly obey, like, we need to learn how to more flexibly engage with them because there's

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.040
 always that arising aspect of awareness

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.780
 of our experience, whether it's going to be a nice thing that we like or a difficult thing that we

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.040
 don't, it's always we're always going to be moving.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.720
 And so I say that not because I can do that but just it's that contracting against things is more

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:40.210
 or less the root cause of this suffering that we experience like something happens, we contract, we

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.040
 suffer, like, as opposed to something happening

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:49.980
 and we try to open and be aware and clear and receptive doesn't mean we have to gobble it up or

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.040
 praise it or just to be present with it.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:58.520
 And I think this is such a key vajriana point and I can't I can't do it but I know that's the

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:05.220
 teaching is to really be with what's happening. And in terms of visualization like really, it means

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.040
 incorporating the relative and not

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.530
 incorporating the relative part too because it's I mean the relative isn't just, of course, there's

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:21.190
 all definitely, particularly when we're going through Mahayana and distinguishing how you know

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:25.040
 there's a difference, but at the same time that that absolutely still includes the relative, you

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:25.040
 know,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 so if you're throwing out the relative, guess what else you're throwing out, you know.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.040
 And this whole book, I mean, of course it just flows together so beautifully.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:49.250
 In a way, it also kind of seems like this advice on visualization. It almost seems like it's an

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:56.630
 extension of the guru yoga practice is that kind of maybe goes over more, goes more over the actual

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.040
 instruction.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:09.450
 And then of course, and then there's the whole story. But I mean, every single chapter of the book

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:15.040
 all relates with the next one or the first one.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.630
 You want to read the second point real quick and then I mean it's really re emphasizing what we've

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.040
 already talked about.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.040
 That's good. Yeah, I was gonna say this actually comes directly from the story.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.560
 So if I remember correctly in the story this comes after they've, they've met and I think they're,

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:39.260
 they're walking now. So they began walking and after a few steps the yogi stopped and said, you

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.040
 must remember all the advice I had given you, you must have constant

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:48.610
 pure devotion and continue to pray to Guru Padmasambhava. Always follow the instructions I gave you

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.040
 today.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.850
 Then he gave a few hints to show that he was Guru Padmasambhava. He did not say, I am Padmasambhava

00:36:53.850 --> 00:37:00.000
, but he gave some hints. Then he pulled a small horn from his chuba, blew it in the different

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.040
 directions.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:07.140
 The moment he did that he disappeared. When Ratna Lingpa saw that the yogi had disappeared, he

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.150
 thought that maybe the yogi was a magician and that the rolled paper he had placed on his shrine

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.040
 would be gone.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:18.060
 He ran inside the check and saw that the paper was still there. After his meeting with the yogi,

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:24.260
 Ratna Lingpa's whole demeanor and outlook changed. He was always very happy and his mind remained

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.040
 in the natural state.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:40.040
 Page 100, last paragraph. Page 101, first and second paragraphs.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:47.040
 I thought a big, a big point with this chapter in general and this paragraph too is that it's about

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.040
 kind of loosening up how convinced we are of our version of what's happening.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.820
 I mean, obviously, Ratna Lingpa, of course, is a great turtan and so he's so flexible in such

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:06.040
 realization, but all of how he's experiencing in the story is like he's so available for it.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.380
 Like he's so kind. He really wants to support this person. He hasn't met. He doesn't really

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.040
 understand how could he be happening, but he like goes with it.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:23.430
 You know, and it's just how he's so fluid with what's happening. And then it seems like with

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:29.040
 visualization too, it's really helping us to try to really become more fluid, like we're not so

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.040
 convinced of our limited idea of what it is.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.340
 And all this visualization and deities are all this makeup, this mythic something that really is

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:42.700
 not it's all just make believe and that's kind of, you know, there's like that general idea of that

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.040
.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.640
 The magic and mystery is like for kids or for ancient times, and it's not really the real

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.040
 instruction or something.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:58.180
 But I think it's really... Mervice has emphasized so much and it's just at the center of the Vajray

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.040
ana that the nature is totally mysterious.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.510
 Like the more, the closer we get to it, the closer we are with our experience, the more flexible it

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.040
 is. I mean, the more we can't pin it down.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.890
 And then, I mean, here he just blows the horn and disappears and it's just all of it. It's just so

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.040
 incredible.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.040
 And we could easily dismiss it and be comfortable with what we already believe.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:44.650
 I mean, along those exact same notes, like Grandpa Chase has said so many times, like when the time

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:44.730
 for doubt and investigation and analysis and exploration is when you're not on the cushion

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.040
 practicing, when you're engaged consciously with that study and contemplation.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.040
 When it comes to the meditation itself and the visualization, you drop that completely.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:40:00.130
 Don't engage in that aspect of the practice. Just have, like Drago was emphasizing too, that about

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:05.590
 your confidence, you know, that for the whole rest of your life, okay, maybe this is just whatever,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.040
 a game.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:12.290
 But now we're not playing a game, you know. You're engaging with the display of your own true

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.040
 nature.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.040
 That's what the whole aspect of the visualization is, you know. Your own mind.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:24.440
 You're working with your own mind's flexibility. Do the blessings of the lineage and the devotion

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.040
 in your meeting with all those circumstances.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:34.060
 So, anyway, that's a really, and that I think does take a lot of practice for some people,

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.040
 including myself, you know, to be able to just let it go a little bit.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:46.040
 You're practicing just like, you know, when that comes up, just not now.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:53.260
 You know, I'm not, that's not what I'm doing now, you know. Come back to just, otherwise it's just

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.040
 like, you're tearing down your practice.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:03.630
 You're tearing down your practice and you're tearing down your ability to really, you know, have

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:08.040
 that confidence.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:15.250
 Sorry, sorry if this seems a little off topic for you. I just, I keep rereading these last two

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.040
 lines in that second point.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.340
 It's just something really striking about it, and maybe it's because I'm doing a little bit of a

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.040
 word substitution here.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.040
 But, so it says the yogi, but I keep reading Padmasambhava.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.040
 So after his meeting with Padmasambhava, Ratna Linkpa's whole demeanor and outlook changed.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.040
 He was always very happy, and his mind remained in the natural state.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.040
 And I guess I keep kind of, particularly, you know, the conversations we have about Padmasambhava

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.040
 and, you know, that flexibility,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:53.000
 but also how, you know, nature of your mind and, you know, that all those different ways that Ratna

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.040
 Linkpa really talked about,

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.040
 not only the flexibility, but all the different levels of meaning of Padmasambhava.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:05.300
 And just, you know, so those two sentences really just kind of seems to spark when you really kind

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:15.040
 of play with the flexibility in that word, you know, in that title.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.590
 And also, you know, it seems to keep tying back to, again, what Ann really started the conversation

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:27.040
 with, talking about that essence and feeling that presence.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.040
 I just thought those two lines are so beautiful.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:40.250
 And here, like Lya said, Padmasambhava is the root guru of Tibetan Buddhism. They always say that,

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:45.040
 you know. So it's like, he's, it's like when you meet the guru, you know,

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:53.490
 and you're open with that flexibility, like Drago was saying, you go with that, you're meeting the

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.040
 natural state that's just taking form as a human or an old man or a woman or whatever, you know.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.860
 So reading it that way, like you were saying, Lojo, it's like when you meet the mind of the guru

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:09.040
 embodied in a form, and like he said, follow those instructions of that what I said, you know.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.560
 And then he felt so joyful, had so much devotion, all the circumstance come together beautifully if

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.040
 he would have been like, oh, you're not, you know, who are you?

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:28.040
 He discovered so many of these profound terms.
