Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 11\nMay 8, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600
 Our native nature is known as the Everness Buddha Samantabhdra. Why is Samantabhdra?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 Samantabhdra is a Sanskrit word. If you translate it, the words turn good. All good. All good.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.240
 Everness is all turn good. Nothing is need to add, nothing need to subtract. Nothing needs

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:41.520
 to add. It's complete perfect. There's nothing need to add. New things don't happen. Also,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 there's nothing errors. Mostly, it's something that we have to subtract. Therefore, it's

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.040
 all turn good. And for those reasons, in the Buddha's teaching and as well as many great

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.720
 master's teaching mentioned when they instructing us how to meditate, there's nothing to add,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.040
 nothing to remove, relaxing on the natural state as it is. We heard those many times.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 That means, we should connect to our own Samanta bhadra. Samanta bhadra, it is right here. There's

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.960
 nothing to add that we don't need to add. There's nothing to need to subtract. There's some

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.440
 mistakes,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 the errors. Yes, b. B, yes, it is. Discover that treasure. So, so now Japji discovered. Japji is in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.240
 that state. It's called Heruka. Therefore, it's Heruka. Heruka is named the rattles, that one was

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:00.400
 subdued and one was transcendent all the neurotic states. When whoever transcendent and smite the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:09.760
 neurotic state of the mind, that is known as the absolute Heruka. That is true Heruka. That is true

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:20.480
 rata. So, what is the name of that? Sena chodious. Sena chodious. Please come or please arrive.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:31.120
 Make me like you. Help me like you. I follow in your footsteps, exactly footsteps. Breakfast,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.360
 medication, determination, courage, commitment, joyful effort to dharma and what you did. I follow

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.760
 that footsteps or to the benefit of all living beings or to discover my energy. Call it like you.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:56.240
 For that reason, help me bless me. Bless my body. Bless my speech. Bless my mind. Bless me all the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.440
 time and make me, bless me that we don't have any separations. Make me stay my nature, exactly as

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.000
 is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.480
 not let fall down by the duality, consumption, hindrance. Make me meaningful, meaningful and so

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.800
 please look as here. Please think of us, this place. We are the practitioners. We are dedicated

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.480
 practitioners, dispel all the obstacles, temporary convictions, those duality,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.240
 consumption, temporary. To compare them with our ordinary raka state, all this is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.880
 temporary. It's not going to last forever. It's also came. It's not something connected to the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.800
 nature. It came newly common, then obscured. For therefore, we can remove. Ever is completely

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.840
 connected to the raka, we cannot remove. It is temporary. That's why we heard so many times in

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.920
 the teaching. Teaching is like clothing in the sky. Clothes are not connected to the sky,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.680
 space. It's newly arrived due to the different conditions and circumstances. All right.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:17.040
 It came, it will go. And conditions come perfect for that. It will really go away.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 Therefore, here I say, dispel the obstacles, temporary conclusions. Show me and empower me

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.640
 beyond the meeting and the partings. Help me. So beyond the party and the meeting of the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.600
 realization,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.240
 exactly as you. Give me the perfect meaning of the absolute chief of status, your status,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.280
 give me that. So they'll not have to be separated by the duality, temporary conditions. And be in

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:58.800
 that status. And then, let's say that, as well as pray to the woman. And then,
