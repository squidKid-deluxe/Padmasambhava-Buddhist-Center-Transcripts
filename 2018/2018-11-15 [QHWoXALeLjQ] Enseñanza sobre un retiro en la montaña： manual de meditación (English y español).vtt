 por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por,

 por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por, por,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 por, por, por, por.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 That's what I'm doing.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And again, we have the love and the time and the freedom.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 That is the essence at the very core of the Dharma.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And with all the love, love and kindness, the compassion and kindness,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 even we are practicing, thinking we are doing practices,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 our practice has become kind of essence of that.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Therefore, this love and the compassion and kindness,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 which is also, when we extend it to every living being,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 is not as political.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 That is very important and we should activate that with it,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 with our attitude, more with it.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And with it, every living we have the joy and peace,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 happiness, freedom, suffering, the difficulty.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 But, well, you can say that every week,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 that even for one minute at every week,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 we are doing something beautiful.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 We are doing something meaningful in our life,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 in our day, in our time.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 I want to say that we are doing something beautiful.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 And with that, we were attitude and total.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Then and above that, we can add as purity understanding.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Purity within their things.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Ah!

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 That is very unattainable.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Everything is in life state.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 As we went exploring with involvement.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 All the forms are enlightened as the white umbrella.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 All the forms are illuminated as the white umbrella.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 All the forms are enlightened as the sound of the white umbrella.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 We are doing something beautiful in our life.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 All the space in our mind are very enlightened as the white umbrella's mind.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And that is, then again, what are these?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Form is emptiness.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Emptiness is form.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Sound is emptiness.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Sound is emptiness.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Emptiness is sound.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And the space in my mind is emptiness.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And emptiness is mind.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Do you think that it is serious?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 For myself, it is the form of the body.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 The body is the form.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 The body is the form of the body.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 The body is the form of the body.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 The body is the form of the body.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 The body is the form of the body.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 The body is the form of the body.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 This is immediately, immediately, immediately.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Immediately that we do not understand that.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 The reality is that is what really it is.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 And therefore, having that, we trust you or start that realization with our own mind

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.130
 and bring out that quality is known as then for the purity, understanding of the nature of

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.000
 everything.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 So for example, when you practice and meditate, whenever you have the time,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 and when you sit down on the cushion and reflect on those three qualities.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 All and appreciation, bodhicata, and purity, understanding of where things are, we need devotion.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 And then, I'm going to relax, stay in that.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 After that, relax your mind for a few minutes.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Every time, for three minutes, relax.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Relax in the present state of your nature, of the mind.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 After that, then for example, you have this hand.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Then you begin this, for example, these practices.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Now these practices, for example, I told this morning the importance, the power,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 and the benefit of these practices already I mentioned.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 But also, and I can speak a little more later.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 According to the great master Raghasa.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Now these practices begin again when you practice as a native tree.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.330
 First is the foundation of practices, and then practices, these practices, and completing part of

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.000
 the practices.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 That's every practices.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Now the foundation part of practice, that's preparation part of the practice.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 That start with the seven line prayer.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 As you did this just now.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And three times, seven line prayer, three times.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Lineage prayers, and then all these lineage prayers, and then you do the rahum and bodhita.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 A lineage prayer with practicing, because again we need to connect it to the lineage.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Enlightenment, the blessings of the enlightenment is the electric state.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And came through, the electric came through the wires.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And with the connections.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 And similarly, blessing is coming within it.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 With the connections.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And that will activate our nature and our beauty and bring the eliminations.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 In order to make that connection and that bring that light in our heart and mind.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:59.260
 As I said already, to do that, first we need joy and appreciation and bodhita. We already

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.000
 understand as many times and then devotion.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 And devotion is joy and appreciation.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And through the preciousness.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And through the confidence.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 So devotion is combination of joy and appreciation and through the preciousness and confidence.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And a good combination of the beautiful nature of our nature and the mind will activate our

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 beautiful enlightenment or the potential.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And that will call it of the devotion, also it will dispel our skeptical doubt and hesitations.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:22.190
 And that will call it of the nature of the mind or devotion will make our sound no settle down on

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.000
 our own with a ground.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It will stabilize our practices.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And then it will make change and difference in progress.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Therefore, devotion is so important and for that, it also deepens the energy of our nature.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 For that reason, we do all that energy prayers.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.380
 Once you build that energy, if you don't complete the lineage prayer, then make sure to do that raf

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.000
u and bodhita.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 And that is very again our, when you take rafu to home, you are taking rafu.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 You are taking rafu in the Vedra white umbrella.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And you are developing bodhita.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 I think many of you already know, I know you know, but few of you don't know it is love and

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 compassion.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Find it for all 17 days with the commitment.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.170
 And that commitment in the courage you develop in that of loving kindness and compassion, right in

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.000
 the presence of the old white amaret.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So, for those reasons, then you take rafu and bodhita.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 And rafu and bodhita is not included here.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.210
 For those who, I mean, and I told this, like this film, this master, Rava Aksi is one of the very

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.000
 famous masters in the Tibetan.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Buddhism, in particular, in a nimma, in a Buddhist school of Tibetan.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:52.340
 This rafu in bodhita is something that we can adopt of his own teaching that told, adopted, and

00:32:52.340 --> 00:33:00.240
 they added with every sadhana, that practice manual that he wrote, that you can edit that so we can

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.000
 do that.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 And Lord, then, for example, we can do this, the adopted rafu in bodhita from Bodhasadu.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:25.620
 And those who help, like Rava Aksi is the teaching of the practice of the Amitabha, practice of the

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:33.000
 marriage, the Buddha, and from there, rafu in bodhita,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 who only adopted that from that religion.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 And Lord, for example, I think many of you have this booklet, but I can't comment on it's hard.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 At 74, you added, you adopted this.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And it's in page 74.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Now, how we do these practices, I mean.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:42.600
 That is how you completed the Dini de prayers, how you're going to rest gently right in front of

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.000
 your space as white umbrella.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 She appeared right in front of our sky.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Exactly as we did meditation this morning during empowerment.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 And she is surrounded by all the Buddha's bodhisattva and the Dini de masters.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 And she is in volume and all the Buddha's three times in a ten direction.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And in front of her, there, again, to the stone, the wood, the yogurt.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Then you guide this rafu and bodhita prayer.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:48.850
 And that is here, again, I mean, it's already translated in Spanish, so the first two lines are raf

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:49.000
u.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 The last two lines are bodhita in these four lines.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:10.850
 And so, in this case, white umbrella, or the very white umbrella, is in volume and also bodhana

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.000
 sandals.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And with that, really understanding that I checked rafu, I'm going to make close connection to you.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Until I become the Buddha.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 And make that statement and reading confidence and joy.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 And then, the last two lines are the bodhita.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And bodhita is, again, rafu is a general to all Buddhism.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Techno rafu is Buddha, Dharma, sandals, all different.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 And bodhita is very special practices of the Mahayana.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.490
 Our practice is not just a practice only for our son or my son, but I'm practicing for all living

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.000
 beings.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 I'm practicing this for my family, my friends, my neighbor, my country, all the living beings.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 With that kind of talk, with the compassion, with the considerations of hearing hope.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 And then, then join this phrase.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.340
 This joining is what you are actuating in your heart that you're pronouncing, highlighting, and

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.000
 that letter by everyone.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.900
 And that letter here, clearly, by Varyasura Soti, and all the Buddha's bodhisattvas, and as well as

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.000
 all the Sangha members.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Regarding this very clear mind and a devoted mind.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.020
 And our mind is not obscured or approximated by any means, with tiny, same notes in that clear mind

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.000
 three times.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So that is bodhita.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Then bodhita also essentially is so specific and so powerful, so important.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Therefore, we are activating, again, reactivating that God in us, and one more time.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And that is known as, then, in the Buddha teaching, all boundless, all all in major levels.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:30.600
 All in major levels are in major level of love, in major level of compassion, in major level of

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.000
 videos, or joy, in major level of economy.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 And this is, again, this whole in major level is expression of our compassion, our loving-kindness.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.220
 And with clear understanding, again, we are pronouncing, maintaining our mind in that state, and

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.000
 pronouncing that clearly, and we think that every living being.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And which is also translated in Spanish, so you will know.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 By our loving-kindness, we all, living being, everyone has happiness.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 And by our loving-kindness, we make every living being have the cause of happiness.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 So we are reaching to the cause, and it is a result.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 What is cause of joy or happiness? What is cause of happiness?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Cause of happiness is love and compassion.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:09.080
 And with every living being, they really have the great, strong compassion and still loving-kind

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.000
ness.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.340
 When you have the love and compassion in heart, or whoever has, that will activate it as a ripple

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:25.000
 effect, or it becomes like a ripple effect, or the chain of reaction.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 It creates the great energy, great like quality of the joy, the appreciation, calm, and peaceful.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:52.560
 When you bring that quality, calm, and peaceful, and happiness, that is not a thing of joy or peace

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.000
.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 What is caused by is love, is compassion.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 So love and compassion, it cause of joy and apprehension.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 Peace and happiness.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Therefore, we make every living being increase in their love and compassion, that because of that,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 it will, what they want, that will have what they wanted or they're looking forward will have,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 which is happiness, peace.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:46.130
 And then, the next one is again, reaching, sincerely, strongly, reaching that every living being is

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:50.000
 a prequel to suffering.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 And suffering, difficulty, troubles, miserable conditions.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.390
 And not just only that, but we're also reaching, cause that created, created miserable suffering

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:17.000
 and that uncomfortable, may also that go on, that need, out of that.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.160
 The fundamental goal and the conditions of suffering and miserable, restless, difficulties are,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.000
 again, this power of the emotions.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And the opposite of completion and loving kindness.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 What are those?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Power, aggressions.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 And then, very obsessive grasping.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 And then, arrogance.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 And then, gels.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.780
 When that is developed in the heart, in the mind, and that then, a reaction created to individual

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:19.000
ist and begin to experience that uncomfortable, miserable, headache, and then kind of dilemma.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 And create chaos to that environment, to that individualist mental environment.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 As well as that physical environment.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 So therefore, fundamental, really, cause of the troubles.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 What suffering is, is this negative emotion.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 So we want, again, free from that emotion.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 That, what is that? Again, love and compassion.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 And that joy and appreciation.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 All of that comes from natural, so beautiful.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Reaching that strongly to all living beings.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 And the next one is rejoice.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 And as well as, joy to you.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Rejoice is, again, so important, so powerful.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Many times, our negative emotions, we have all extendence of the gelsness.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.830
 And when they say, good situation, good fulfillment, and happiness, and kind of like, many times,

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:58.000
 we kind of question, or we kind of like, not so appreciate what they experience.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.610
 You see that, any sense of experience of good, happiness, and peaceful. Really, we, they have

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.000
 lasted forever that good for happiness and good things.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Not just only there, but we all living with experience, similar situations, similar circumstances.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.680
 Everyone has joy and peace, happiness, sincerely from the heart and the mind, when reaching that

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.000
 tone. That is known as rejoice.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And then, the next one is, fourth one is then, economics.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Economics is me, that our mind, our understanding, but more balanced.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 All equal levels.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Equanimity has two meanings.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 And, equanimity meaning, one meaning, that we all equal.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 And every living beings are equal.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 What did he say? Emotional level, we are equal.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 Design level, we are equal.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Feeling level, we are equal.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 And what that means?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 Again, feeling level, we are equal. We all want happiness and peace.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 And no one wants to also have one suffering and sadness.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 And the mental level, we are all equal.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 And our mind and every one's mental level is very similar.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 There is no really difference at all.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 We like to perform, as we like to perform, they like to perform.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 And we like to be successful, and as we are, everyone also likes to be successful.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 And therefore, every level, we are really equal.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 And the physical level, we are equal.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 All the structures and the connections of our body is very similar.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Even though we appear in a variety of different forms and gestures, but reality level is the same.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Not just the living beings, even the animals.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 And we want the same.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 So what is really different?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Therefore, with every living being, there are other strengths of this economy, equalization.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 And that is one way to bring equalization.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Otherwise, equalization is more connected to our mind.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 When we are so attracted, where is that attachment?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 When you're so kind of like, I agree, so cleanly, or we like to be distended.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 Where is that mind?

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 Both are just exploration of the mind, the reality level, both are Indians.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 It's not really existing.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 That everyone is also same.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 In the same level, nothing is permanent.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.090
 And something that our kind of, every part of our life, what we think is so important, so distant,

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:45.650
 that thing is to be met, maybe so much like upset and emotion, so forth, to protect, or to maintain

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:46.000
 that.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 That part of life is nothing, really, that bit of movement.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Our kind of feeling, or the emotion, or the mental nominations are supposed to really change.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 So there is reality.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 That means there is nothing substantial, solid, existing at all.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Only mind, mental grounded, and the level that they hold on to them.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 That all the kind of, what's called, all the process that they have.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 But reality is all illusion.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 That is reality.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 That's the nature of where the nature is.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.200
 Trying to relax and release all of those emotions related to the kind of ups and downs and

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.000
 irregularities.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Really release that, relax on the nature.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 What is important is to bring more love and contagion, find it to every living being.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 That is, that never changes.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Loving kind is a complaint of love, so important when you are young.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Loving kind is a complaint that is so important, we are in the middle-air.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 And loving kind is a complaint that is so important, also we are on the more grown-up levels.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.540
 And any and any negative emotions are trouble-maker when we are young, when we are middle-air, when

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.000
 we are grown-up.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 And trying to activate what is good for us, beginning, now, and future, it is good.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.370
 For that reason, what the Buddha kept coming, a great feature Buddha said, "Love and contagion are

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.000
 the bottom."

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 Negative emotions, anger and jealous, hateful, aggressive and obsessive are samsara.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 And it's trouble-maker.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 By knowing that, bring more realization of people in it.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Have we ever to do that? Then we are really maintaining and practicing perfectly.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 And so with those understanding, do these four-boneless prayers again three times.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.660
 When you say these prayers, not just saying the word, but really trying to recollect it, meaning

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.000
 that to the heart.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:26.540
 So it is the expression of the heart, not just the lips are strongly in the presence of the white

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.000
 umbrella and all the blood of the Lord inside.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.720
 And then after you've completed this rafuk in Bodhisattva, and then you are right from Vedasara S

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.000
oti.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.750
 So Vedara in the white umbrella and as well as all the Bodhisattva emanates from the light to you,

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:54.000
 to us and to all the living beings that remove all the little troubles and suffering.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 And it activated our love and it was every living being.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.470
 And finally, every of those in Vedala dissolve to the white umbrella, and the white umbrella

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:14.000
 dissolve in the center's heart syllable, own syllable, and that dissolve to you.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 [Spanish]

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.220
 Now, if you have time, when it dissolves to your heart center and the edge of the mind, it's

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.000
 completely merged inseparable with your neck of the mind.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 If you have time, edit it for one, two, three, five minutes, stay silent.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 [Spanish]

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 Today, in Vedayana teaching, there is two meditations.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Those are, if I use the name, with counting, meditation, with silence.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 These two meditations are also named in Vedayana teaching, visualization, and a dissolving state.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 [Spanish]

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 And both are meditations.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:53.370
 You? It's then after you did. So, now I say silence, meditation, or the dissolving meditation for a

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:56.000
 few minutes, every other time.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.910
 And now, where you are in that status of the dissolving silence of meditation, then you begin

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:11.000
 practicing of this practice.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 [Spanish]

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 That is, again, as in the teaching said, we look to this sadhana, very dream.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 [Spanish]

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:45.840
 Say that "ah" and then chime this in a dissolving state. And also, I'm going to say "ah" in the

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:51.000
 expressible beyond the consumption. Chime that mind every time and really meditate.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.950
 All, when you see this meaning, meditating in this meaning, for, again, another two, three minutes,

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:01.000
 a quarter of your time.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 [Spanish]

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.930
 This, again, in the Vedayana teaching, when I say this deep black meditate is known as every kind

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:29.000
 to simplify. This meditate has two meditations.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 Emptiness meditation and compassion meditate.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 [Spanish]

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 So, whose line is meditation on the emptiness?

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 [Spanish]

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 And that, to kind of invoke that emptiness realization, we join "ah".

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 "Ah" is very similar song in Vayana Buddhism and as well as Vedayana.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:21.290
 This is true "ah" actually. And this is called, like, it's a home "ah" that we join, that "ah". And

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.000
 then second is this one, "ah".

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 That home "ah", that is symbolizing the song.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 That symbolizing emptiness.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 What is the difference between "ah" and the Sanskrit, "long ah" and the quote, "short ah"?

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
 [Spanish]

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 And the home "ah", that "ah" is long "ah".

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 [Spanish]

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 And this "ah" is short "ah".

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 [Spanish]

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
 And so, this "ah" symbolizing of the emptiness.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 [Spanish]

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 And also, this "ah" is commonly used this "ah" as negations.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
 [Spanish]

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
 I mean, Spanish too, right? "Ah".

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 [Spanish]

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:49.440
 So, this "ah" is "ah" is simple to negation. But this negation is not negation in this case. That

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.000
 negation is conceptual.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
 This "ah" is beyond the negation, beyond the existence.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 [Spanish]

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
 This is the grasp in the claim.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
 Negation is conceptual.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 [Spanish]

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
 Claim negation.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
 [Spanish]

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
 This is beyond.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
 [Spanish]

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 Our "ah" is in the Buddha teaching menu "ah" is the source of every song.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 And "ah" is the source of every display.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.000
 And when you find our "ah", also you don't have any lead effort. It naturally arises.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
 And for the Sanskrit language, all different syllables, every head is a different source.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.550
 It comes through a way to come in different master's, different kind of source of the body or the

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:04.000
 head and everywhere.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 But "ah" is the one that has no particular source.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 [Spanish]

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:24.000
 [Spanish]

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 And according to all the Sanskrit, every song system has "ah".

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
 [Spanish]

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.480
 And therefore, in the Buddha teaching, known as the Tantra teaching, known as the Vedara, then you

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.000
 see namaskrita, or then you see mayajali tantra.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
 [Spanish]

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
 And in that teaching said "ah" is the source of every display.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 [Spanish]

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 So that, now this case, what it is? It is ultimate, absolute nature of our mind.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 [Spanish]

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
 That nature of your mind, or my mind, is how that is.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 [Spanish]

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 Inexpressible beyond the perception.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
 [Spanish]

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
 Look to your side. What was this sound? In the Inma teaching, what is it?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
 Starting and practicing together.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 [Spanish]

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 They're not really separating, starting as a study and as a practice.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 The spontaneous, we study, we practice.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
 [Spanish]

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 So, you should apply what we're talking here, right to your mind.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
 And find out where is mind.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 And when you find mind, can you explain?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000
 If you can explain, then it's not inexpressible.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
 If we can't express anything, that is all inexpressible.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.260
 If we can figure something about mind when we're practicing or find, then it's done beyond the

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.000
 perception.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 Send them nothing. Send them nothing that we can find anything to see.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 That's the question, beyond the perception.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
 As our mind is in that state.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 The reality is that all these phenomena are like these states.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 If you look carefully and think more and more of each of those, nothing is ready to explain

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 anything.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.180
 I understand that these modern times, those modern physics, and the scientists are discovering

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.000
 those strength heroes, physics and those congruent physics.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 They discover, there's nothing to explain.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.840
 They went to the everywhere, through the material power, the analyte, the MSG, and there's so far

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.000
 nothing to find.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.350
 But according to what the Buddha is teaching, all those great masters, their analysis, or their

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:49.000
 mathematics, there's nothing to find.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 The reality is that the level of everything is beyond the perception.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
 And everything is beyond the inexpressible.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
 Then what is this?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 This is what the Buddha still thinks, a magical display.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
 It's named also "Illusions."

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 Not just some illusion and some not, but in the Buddha teaching, all illusions.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
 Illusion, in me, is bad or something bad and not good.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
 That's the way the nature is.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
 That included our physical, our mind.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 That magical display.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.570
 So seeing that touch to the old bed of everything is an old and natural great emptiness, built from

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:12.000
 the beginning, inexpressible.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
 And meditating, or being in that natural state, is known as meditation.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 When we relax in that natural state, that is the common language, I think, "home touch best."

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 That is known as an emptiness, that is also known as worship.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:51.000
 And this is then also, it is an absolute mother, white umbrella.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.610
 The reality is to understand it, bring our realization, and dispel all those unnecessary, unbenef

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.000
icial illusions will be transformed.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:21.000
 And then we begin advancing to the different realization levels known as bodhisattvas and vodas.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 So, as I said, if we have time, meditate in this state for few minutes or whatever your time.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 Now this great, inexpressible nature is not brain emptiness.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 And full of potentials.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
 Full of qualities.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
 And full of richness.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 Those richnesses are known, and all that is important are known as in Buddhism, wisdom.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 Among the five Muslims, one of the first one, wisdom, is known as compassion.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
 So where that great compassion arises,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 from that inexpressible nature of the ordinal.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 And then arises as great energy, as I've ordered for morning sunlight, with clear sky.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
 When you heat the sunlight in the sky, there's no obscurations, no obstructions, blockage.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.330
 It is the lemonade or clear, born of brightness of the whole sky, like that. The great loving

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.000
 kindness, the compassion for this.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 Completely perversed every way.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 And then the great compassion is your and my nature of the mind.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
 This time that compassion has not struck with this in that place, it is perversed.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
 As in a light in this room, it is perversed.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000
 Every time, in that state, again, for a minute or one minute or whatever.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 Just be in that calm and peace and love and compassion, that richness is there.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 And after that, that compassion, power of compassion, now came of the syllable Aum.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 What I said here, by the Aum syllable and the white umbrella, I'm asking.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 Now, what is that Aum? Aum is compassion, Aum is loving kindness, Aum is great emptiness.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 Aum is your own awareness, your own nature of the mind.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:51.000
 Aum is the beginning of the entire universe of the pure land of the white umbrella.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.670
 This Aum is the beginning as the nuclear power of loving kindness. A big wisdom that will touch you

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:06.000
 all, send you peace, and remove their suffering from the difficulty trouble.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 Bring them joy, peace, happiness, to every center they will be.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.200
 There is an ultimate kind of essence, essence of essence, like in the way, nuclear of your own, in

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.000
 it, nature of the compassion.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 Yet, it is not substrate of solid existence. This is magical display.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.000
 And then, from that, begin emanating so many light as we discuss it this morning.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.680
 And so many light went different directions, contracted all the Buddha's bodhisattva and leaving

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.000
 the white umbrella in the pure land of the Amitabha.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 And all the blessings of the white umbrella's body speak to mind.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.290
 All came, those blessings, every blessing came in the form of the syllable Aum, white Aum, red Aum,

01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:30.000
 blue Aum.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.470
 All in the form of the white umbrella, and all form in the ritual objects, and as well as song of

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:42.000
 the, definitely the blessing song and mantra song.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 All that absorbed back to the Aum, white Aum syllables.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:05.890
 And that light, again, forms, the syllable light that came, to all the beings of Aum came and

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:16.000
 attracted to all the beings of the sittarems.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.860
 And removed, every month, suffering the difficult troubles, whatever they are going through,

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.000
 nightmares, completely removed.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.680
 All those difficulties, and completely kind of brought up, they are all in the quadrant of natures

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.000
 of love and compassion and courage and confidence.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.530
 So every universe and world of the beings are, wherever they are, now already brought to the

01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:43.000
 enlightened sense.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 [Spanish]

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
 And they like to return back to the Aum syllables.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 [Spanish]

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000
 And in that moment, then, that Aum syllable, from that Aum syllable, instantly appeared ourself,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
 each of us, as white Aum red.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 [Spanish]

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
 And that was here, in a hard light.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.000
 That moment, I recollected it into the primordial, inseparable wisdom, and the Samaya beings.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 [Spanish]

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 And was the main being, living with a white umbrella in a pure land?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
 Samaya beings in ourself, as we are committed to do breakfast and act light.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
 Now, these two are no different, become as one.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
 That means, each of us, truly as white umbrella.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
 And he is totally enlightened beings.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 And we are going to maintain with this meditation, with courage, with commitment, with confidence.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 Not lingering without hesitation and attractor thought during these practices.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
 [Spanish]

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
 And then, this kind of white clay. So then, how she is.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
 Generally, white umbrella has many different emanations.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
 And so, one face, two arms, two legs.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 And so, also different colors, too.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.200
 This time is white, color is white, and he has all these figures. I mean, that is what we are going

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.000
 to do in your life.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.370
 And so, and then, he has all these like, I think you have to put your foot good, and so he has one

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:48.000
 golden face.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
 [Spanish]

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 And as clearly, great master Raga, explaining, two hundred are white.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 [Spanish]

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 Yes, as her body is white.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
 And then, right is yellow.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
 And left is red.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000
 So, the left, right side is red.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
 Left side is, like two hundred face are green.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:38.000
 And three hundred face are facing up in the sky.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 Those are blue.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 So, it's clearly all that, and every one, every one of those hands are in different expressions.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
 And front head is very peaceful.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 Front two hundred white heads are very peaceful face.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 With smiling, with calm.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.000
 And left two hundred face are laughing.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
 With laughing, again, a different expression.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 And the back side, three hundred face are red.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
 They are, in a way, very respectful.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 They are yelling.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
 They are yelling, they are very, very peaceful.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 Yelling, such as what?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 You bullshit.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 You, you ego claim.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 You ego claim bullshit.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000
 Baby, what's their goal?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
 Baby, master.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 Baby, master?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
 Baby, master?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
 Master.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
 What is that?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
 Baby, master?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 Yeah.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
 What's baby, master?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
 Unbelievable.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 As far as the baby.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 As far as the baby.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 Baby, as long as the baby, watch out.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
 Careful.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 You, you, you ego maniacs.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
 You ego, you ego-holics.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
 Ego-holics?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 Ego-holics.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
 Ego-holics.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 A hundred of his.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
 I'm very wrathful.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 And eyes are rolling.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
 Rolling out with lightning.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
 And immediately also burning all the obstacles.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 Like magics.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
 Curs.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
 Saucers.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 And the nightmares.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
 Bad omens.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 And everything's really smashing.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
 And then it has all those three eyes eating all that.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 She is just so powerful.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
 The whole.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 And then he has 500 feet as he said.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 And 500, sorry, one thousand feet.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 One thousand feet.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 Five hundred feet as he said.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 The right five head.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 Five hundred feet.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 Right five hundred feet is slowly expanding.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 Crushing all the, what's called all the pears.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
 That's what we go through.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 All the pears.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 Such as the whole pears.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
 We have both anxiety, troubles,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 miserable condition.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
 Pops of the dead.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 Pops of the old.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
 Pops of the sicknesses.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 I mean pears, sorry.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 Pears of the dead.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Pears of the old egg.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
 Pears of the, of the, all the difficulty troubles.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 Really crushing pears.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
 And 500 left feet is a slight bend even.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 Again, crushing all the obstacles.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 Negative energies.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
 Negative entities.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
 And then she is so powerful as I said.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000
 And said that, and also she has like 500 head.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 So the last five.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
 One thousand arms.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 Everyone is holding soul.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
 Immediately they are cutting all the negative energies

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 of every head of every living being.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 And all the Buddhas, seven million Buddhas,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 they don't have prawn chakras or prawns.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
 Prawns.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 And right above her head,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 there is seven umbrellas are spinning.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 Now this is quite a play.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
 Oh yeah.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 So that's really, she is the most powerful.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 She is the most compassionate, kindness,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
 thoughtful, toleration.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
 And he is just completely overwhelmed

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 the whole universe or the samsara in the nirvana.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
 And see that, I mean in a sense clearly.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
 So see that clearly as we are sitting

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
 with the right in the middle,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
 middle of the worst of flame and the rainbow light.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 And then sitting on the sun and moon desk.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 Standing, standing.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 And under her feet and then in the teaching,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
 all the obstacles are broken.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 And all the negative energies are broken.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 And she is as the nirvana was the rainbow ball.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:35.000
 And that is what the really teaching said.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 And when he had this lie,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 I think that this mistake is translated

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
 or I think when we translate it,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
 I translate it in the card.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
 And I think that even you can't hold that realization

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
 perfectly, that is not exactly the case.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 Even you can't memorize all this hardness.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
 All this hardness.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
 And so that means what?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:22.000
 Even you didn't memorize all these sadhanas in the mind,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 but just thinking of "hey, hey" and memorizing,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 "hey" is enough then, that's all.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
 So then with this thought,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 and then time is following this phrase.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000
 This is the essence of this approach.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 All this what we went,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 this is the essence of the Buddha teaching

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
 and teaching of Gurdhva Masumbha

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 by this great master Raga Aksi.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 But this following and nine,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
 nine, this is Buddha's teaching.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
 All that, she came actually from chakra of the Buddha

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 and she uttered all the teachings.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
 So that means this is her teaching

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
 and this is the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
 So this is like mantras.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 So then...

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 And then you join this one again.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 So to prompt this bed one and all the way to bed eleven,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 and tell her, "Shiva can think for a year so far."

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
 And that is also very clear by this great master Raga Aksi said,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 "You can do seven times is great,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
 and then medium is five times.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 At least do three times."

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
 And then we can relate on the meditation

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 of white umbrella as we all saw.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000
 And then you join this bed twelve.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 There is three mantras.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
 One is the longest and one is the top.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:09.000
 And again, every time you do these first one, long one, twenty-one times.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:20.000
 That is the principle part of the practice.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
 And then, concluding of the practices,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
 and then part of this is...

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
 Right after this mantra, the thought mantra,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 then you meditate.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
 Now this silence meditates.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 And now silence meditations and is, then, now,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:54.000
 where your white umbrella is dissolved.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
 So that means after this chiding seven times,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:06.000
 you talk mandana, then white umbrella is dissolved.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
 The way it is dissolved, you can do all those mandana of the Buddhas,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 and all those are dissolved to the head.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:25.000
 And here, all body and everything is dissolved to the own syllables.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 Our own syllables dissolve to that great emptiness,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:41.000
 as old in the nature as we started.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
 And then meditate in that status as long as you have five,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 five minutes, ten minutes, or whatever you have.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 During the meditation, how are you going to meditate?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
 And that is, again, this great mantra says so clearly.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 It didn't translate exactly that really clearly into English,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:19.000
 but it's translated from some way roughly in the page quoted.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:27.000
 And look to your own mind, clearly and calmly.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
 Truly, inwardly.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Where there is nothing to see.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 So stay in that status.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000
 Straight as long as you have time.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
 And that is a clear comment that when you look into your own nature of the mind,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 of your mind, it's calm, it's clear.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 It is like a billion.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
 Yet there's nothing to explain.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
 And they're collapsing that nature.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:22.000
 That is the absolute state of the Mother White umbrella.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 And so keep that meditation as you have said many times.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
 So that is the first part of the practice.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000
 And then, completing part of the practice is the dedication.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
 And the dedication practices, as it teaches here, say,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 that by the merit of this meditation and recitation

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
 of all these prayers, guide this, this,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
 and then do your other reading and pray as we have.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 So that is the break by instructions or teachings on this White umbrella.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
 And then, and now, if you have some questions, I will discuss.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 And after that, I will give the translation of these practices.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
 We do these practices together one time.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 So there is the [inaudible] again.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:32.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
 Okay, this has three mantras.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
 One is long, one is medium, one is short.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 The long mantras started with the page nine

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 and through the page 11 of other sixes.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
 And then the [inaudible]

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
 So that is long mantras.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:09.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
 Perhaps the age nine.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
 Yeah, yeah, I will tell that.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
 Long mantras.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
 So long mantras, long, long mantras is the page nine

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 to page 10 and 11, 5 to 11.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
 Okay.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:38.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:31.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:40.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 And as I said, this is the teaching of the Buddha.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000
 This is what the white umbrella spoke when he appeared

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 from the front chakra of the Buddha.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:00.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
 It is the mantra.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000
 Then the middle mantra is in page 12.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.000
 And that is then is like [inaudible]

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
 That is second mantra, the medium mantra.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 And then short mantra is [inaudible]

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
 [ Inaudible ]

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 And then the meaning of the mantra, all this transcendental,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
 is already there, but it is really nothing important.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
 Knowing the meaning or not knowing the meaning.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
 Power of mantra comes by the reputation.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
 Besides the mantra of meditation, all the power comes.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
 It's exactly same as for some when we take the medicine.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
 We know what are ingredients of the medicine.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 If we know that, it is good.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
 But that doesn't really have anything to do particularly

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
 to cure our disease.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
 We should take the medicine as a doctor's instructor

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
 and take that.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
 It will help.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
 And finally, meaning of the mantra is not big and important

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
 to know the practices.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
