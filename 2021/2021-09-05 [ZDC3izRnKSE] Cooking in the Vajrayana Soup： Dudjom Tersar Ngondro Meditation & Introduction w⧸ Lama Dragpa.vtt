NOTE     "synopsis": "Dudjom Tersar Ngondro Meditation and Introduction\n\nLama Dragpa and Lama Laia\nPadmasambhava Buddhist Center\n\n\n\n\u201cCooking in the Vajrayana Soup\u201d\n\n\n\nDay 11\n\nSeptember 4, 2021\n\n\nEver feel like you\u2019re being cooked by the lineage blessings?\n\n\nGood! It might mean you\u2019re going deep and holding yourself accountable to a high standard of integrity, honesty, kindness, follow through, love, and service to all beings!\n\n\nThinking outside of the \"worldly box\" and following the Vajrayana road less traveled demands everything from us. We have to repeatedly show up as fully as presently possible to our own lives in the service of others.\n\n\nWe have to consciously, creatively, willingly, and passionately endeavor along this path!\n\n\nWhich means that our own destructive, egoic habits are going to turn up the heat!\n\n\nFortunately, we have the sacred container of the lineage to support us every step of the way\u2014tried and true methods to test for ourselves so that we can finally become fully free and fully embodied!\n\n\nHow do we find (and continuously rediscover) the perfect temperature to keep pursuing our path of awakening?\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of practicing within a Vajrayana lineage?\n\n\nThis inquiry will consider the extraordinary relative lineage supports that make fully integrating absolute wisdom awareness possible within this lifetime.\n\n\nAnd why the result of casually mixing-and-matching relative supports (even within Buddhism) is a risky endeavor in the context of the Buddhist path towards enlightenment.\n\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha. They are a perfect and complete framework for cultivating a balanced, effective, and rewarding spiritual practice.We\u2019ll also get to practice the entire Ngondro every session!\n\nLearn More:\n\nIn \"Illuminating the Path,\" Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche give clear and profound explanations on how to practice the path of Ngondro \u2013 the foundational set of practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book includes line-by-line commentary on the concise Dudjom Tersar Ngondro revealed by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, detailed instructions on how to practice, and helpful visual illustrations. It is both deep and accessible pointing out how we can see our fundamentally enlightened nature.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.580
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Let's take a moment to do the most important part of the

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.620
 whole time we share here. That's to reactivate our genuine bodhichitta, our feeling of closeness

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.160
 and connection to all beings, and that wish and aspiration that what we're doing right

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.400
 now becomes the direct cause of all beings' happiness and their enlightenment. We'll just

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:21.940
 take a moment to do that. Thank you. I don't think it's a secret that I could say that

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:40.860
 I love the Vajrayana. I love it. We all love it. And part of that love is recognizing that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 Vajrayana is not a permanent honeymoon. When we initially get into Vajrayana or meet a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.380
 realized Dharma teacher or come in contact with the Buddha's teachings, sometimes its

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:10.480
 experience is such a deep relief. Finally, there's a connection there. Regardless of

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.900
 where the teachings are that we connect with, the four noble truths, seeing suffering, the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.140
 cause of suffering, there's a possible way out of suffering forever, and there's an actual

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:30.420
 path to achieve that, to be in the presence of a noble being and to just genuinely receive

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.860
 their acceptance and their love and their pervasive compassion and care and kindness.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.940
 Oftentimes that's a very pivotal moment because it's so rare in this world to receive that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.540
 level of acceptance and to be really seen, just genuinely to be in the presence, that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.380
 someone's with you and they're just fully with you. And we get this burst of enthusiasm

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.820
 and we start practicing, we get interested, just like Lama Lai went over, this faith starts

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.940
 arising, an interest in Dharma, a longing to learn more, even greater longing to try to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.220
 apply it and practice it and actually begin the process of changing our habits. That really

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.820
 starts to open up or wake up or freshen on. And the difficulty is, is that just like everything

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.940
 in life, that there always is a honeymoon phase when something's new, when we travel

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.860
 somewhere new, when we meet someone new, we go to a new place, new house, new car, new

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.860
 website, we refresh the newsfeed, it's a new day, there's that hit, new. And so we don't

00:03:50.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 really have to do any work to get the fresh feeling because it's just new. And so I think

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.180
 that's to be cherished, those connections with these beings, these noble beings, with

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.380
 the path, with the teachings, with all these techniques, is to be deeply cherished and nourished.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.780
 And that becomes the question of walking the path. Because even the teachings say, and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.100
 Venerable Kenshin, Paul Denscher Brimichet and Venerable Kenpo Saewandiny Brimichet have

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.700
 said multiple times that oftentimes in a practice, when we first start practicing the Dharma,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:39.900
 a little bit of practice will release some really big, obvious, destructive habits. And

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.120
 all of a sudden we'll set down big time burdens, just things that have really stuck with us

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.740
 for so long. And a little bit of purification practice will release these big ice shelves

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.860
 of negative habits. And then they go on to say that to really release the subtler habits

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:09.300
 takes a lot of sustained practice. And that's the path. And so I think oftentimes I feel

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:20.500
 like I'm kind of personally interested in opening up kind of cans of worms. Because

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.140
 now the Dharma has been in the United States since some people say the late 1800s, at least

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.340
 for a solid few generations, people of great masters have been coming here. So many teachings

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.540
 have come here. So many have been translated into English and other languages. So many

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:48.500
 centers have arisen. And in general, I think that this time now, and this is my opinion,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.340
 but this time now is not the time to do the ostrich move and stick our heads in the sand

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.900
 and just want a really Dharma light, super simplified, make everything feel okay version

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 of Dharma. Like now there's enough of the Buddha Dharma around the world. And also the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:23.540
 intelligence of audience of people of us, like we're kind of a lot of people are really

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:33.260
 speaking for deep meaning, for nourishment, for nutrition, to not be puritanically told

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:42.780
 what to do. And also to not like in the vacuum of a lot of people are not very big fans of

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.860
 organized religions for a lot of good reasons. History is a long history of some pretty difficult

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.290
 horrible things with a lot of organized institutionalized religion. And as a result of that,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.500
 science

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.100
 and scientific methodologies and looking closely has really gotten sharper attention, which

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.740
 is so incredibly wonderful, which the Buddha taught verify things for ourselves, look thoroughly,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:18.920
 do due diligence. And the problem with that approach is science doesn't answer the question

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.780
 of what is meaningful. It's not what science is designed to do, whether it's chemistry

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:33.540
 or biology or anthropology or sociology. It's that question of what is meaningful, there

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.340
 is this whole that a lot of people are aching to fill with something and we're projecting

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:47.940
 meaning because we're meaning making monkeys, right? We always tell stories. We always have

00:07:47.940 --> 00:08:01.420
 narratives. And so there's this gap to fill of deep meaning.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.220
 And part of Vajrayana, which I'm so impressed and amazed is the more I look at it, the more

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.260
 rich it becomes, the more amazing its response to all these challenging questions are. How

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:20.140
 long for centuries and thousands of years the Buddha has answered these questions and given

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.180
 us the techniques to ask for ourselves, who am I? What is going on? What are different

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:33.340
 ways of knowing? What are different ontological landscapes? What is real? Different world

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.740
 views, different views, different tawas that make sense of these really fundamental perennial

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:46.540
 questions that don't go away. It's like baked into our brains and our minds to ask these

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.060
 questions of deep meaning. And like so many people are hungry for that and we don't want

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.620
 the easy answers like Einstein said, make it as simple as possible, but no simpler.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:06.100
 And Vajrayana steps up to that challenge and all the Buddha's teachings step up to that

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:13.860
 challenge. And so opening some cans of worms and like looking at difficult topics that

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:22.460
 are there to be looked at like devotion is a very controversial topic in a lot of places.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:34.240
 The function of secrecy, nested hierarchies, subtle energy and invisible beings, vast spectrums

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:40.900
 of causality, karma, past lives, future lives, these are all like bread and butter Dharma

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:51.420
 topics for centuries. But in a current window now, these have become really landmine areas.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.100
 And I think it's worth, I mean, it's just like different teachers have said, as we begin

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:02.220
 the path and as we're continuing the path, like it only serves us to look closely at

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:11.080
 the Buddha Dharma. We don't have to look at all the challenges at once. We don't have

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.660
 to investigate every question at the same time, just like we don't have to practice

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:25.460
 every practice at the same time. Like we don't have to do.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.780
 Part of the function of an inquiry is we have to stick with a specific inquiry for enough

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:37.660
 time to let the revelation or the insight or the revealing or the unmasking or the releasing

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:45.980
 or the relaxing to let it naturally happen. We have to stay with the inquiry and support

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:53.580
 it enough that we transform and there's some degree of a resolution or a increased clarity

00:10:53.580 --> 00:11:03.780
 of seeing. And so my general approach is, and just like these teachings, this Dhujum

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:10.700
 Teresar Nundro, to live webcast these teachings when all weird looking at a camera, we don't

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:20.100
 know who's showing up. The container now is so big. Like anything I say now, anything

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.940
 we do, basically we can assume it's being recorded in infinite history. As long as human

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:34.420
 beings exist, the internet will be here. And these kind of become these statements that

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.460
 carry a weight because the recordings are being archived somewhere. And that's a big

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:46.460
 responsibility for all of us. And Vajrayana steps up to that challenge, because every

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:53.900
 moment matters. Every moment and movement of mind, of openness of heart, has a significant

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:03.620
 karmic impact, whether we believe it or not. And so the specific thing I wanted to kind

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:12.520
 of feel into or open up a little today is that as we continue on the path, the beauty

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:22.580
 of the path is as we keep on the path, it opens up. But it only opens up if we open

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:34.720
 up. And that process of opening up of literally, in pretty literal ways, of breaking our habitual

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.500
 common sense normalized boxes, the world views, the deep habits we have of making sense of

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:51.980
 things, we have to like actually open them. I just heard Zok-Sarkhan Sirimache, he defined

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.940
 renunciation as thinking outside of the box. So I thought of that. That's such an interesting

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.700
 definition of renunciation mind. What box, and I assume that I'm kind of contemplating

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:13.860
 this, what box, definitely the worldly box. Like when Manjushri talked to Sachin Kunga

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:21.540
 Ningpo, he taught the parting from the eight, parting from the four attachments. Parting

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.900
 from the first attachment is parting to our attachment to worldly life. And we've heard

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:33.180
 this so many times, the eight worldly concerns. And we can all say it, a lot of us can, that

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.420
 means getting over hope and fear. The only way to get beyond hope and fear is to keep

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:46.940
 opening our own box. And looking what's outside of our box, what's outside of our frame, what's

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.540
 a different way of seeing, a different way of knowing, a different way of tasting, a

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:57.420
 different way of experiencing and engaging life. Basically the Vajrayana Path is asking

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:07.020
 us to be as open to however much feedback from life we can handle. And that completely

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:16.540
 is determined by our own willingness to be upended, to be put in a state of uncertainty,

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:25.100
 to step outside of our normal frames of reference, to keep opening, to keep softening, to keep

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:32.780
 relaxing, to keep inquiring, to actually let our minds be in a state of wonder or awe,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:43.060
 or just to be with a question without demanding an easy resolution. Simple, but not too simple.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:51.900
 To be in a state of actual contemplation where it's like the mind where it's clear and looking

00:14:51.900 --> 00:15:05.660
 closely, but it keeps not finding a definitive fixed answer. And that process of opening,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.020
 of like opening our own box, of like asking someone, developing a trusting relationship

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.500
 with a great noble being or a Vajrayana Master or Guru, and having them help point out where

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.540
 we're getting stuck, where we're holding unrealistic expectations, where our views aren't matching

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.260
 up with reality and so we keep bumping into things and that's called samsara. We have

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:34.540
 that trust with that relationship. We trust the path, refuge. We go for refuge in the Buddha

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:43.180
 Dharma Sangha. We trust it enough to let it, to let it open us up, to let it help us look

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:55.740
 closer and feel more fully, and be kind more fully, like to do things more fully, to enhance

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:05.700
 how we're functioning in life. And that process really feels like getting cooked. It feels

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.740
 you, there are a lot of metaphors for it, but in my little experience with applying

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:20.020
 the teachings, that can really feel like being, like, you know, the brain is ripping, it's

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:30.500
 like learning the process, the neural pathways are re-pathwaying. And there's a lot of science

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.540
 being focused on this, like what actually puts us in a state of learning, of dealing

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.940
 with uncertainty in a way where we don't shut down, but we actually get more inquisitive

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.980
 and more curious. And that's so wonderful that we're actually taking that seriously

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:50.420
 now. It's not just a, this is the only answer kind of model, or the only answer is what's

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:56.580
 tangible right in front of me. But these are questions about what's meaningful in life.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.180
 What's meaningful to me? What's my purpose? What are my essential values? How do I know

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.540
 that something's true? Because someone else knows something's true, and it's a different

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.740
 truth, and it can be contradictory. So like, how do I know how to assess knowing? Buddha

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:19.940
 has like such an extensive teaching on epistemology and logic, all this ontology, and then also

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:26.380
 these performance methodologies to actually enhance our ways of understanding, of knowing,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:33.700
 of making sense, of having fun, like revealing habits that we don't know we have, that we

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.540
 never saw because we just couldn't see it in our box. Like the boxes we have, the frames

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.660
 we have, the views we hold, they're invisible. The funny thing is they're oftentimes not

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:52.900
 invisible to other people. So I have like a mini confession. So the other night, sitting

00:17:52.900 --> 00:18:09.780
 with my wife, it's late, put in a movie. Night at the Museum, part two. Okay. Quality. Ben

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:16.060
 Stiller, Amy Adams, Owen Wilson, the trials, the tribulations, the triumphs, basically

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.260
 the museum, Smithsonian Museum, After Dark, all the mannequins and little figurines come

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.620
 alive. And it's kind of funny because it's culturally relevant. Like when the cave people

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:35.940
 fight the patriotic soldiers, fight the T-Rex, fight the, all the different aspects of historical

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:44.220
 big names or get into a war with each other and somehow try to make friends. And I was

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:51.900
 laughing. There was a scene in the movie and it's this scene where this monkey and another

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.580
 monkey start slapping Ben Stiller in the face and they're slapping each other and they're

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.580
 slapping and I'm just laughing, watching these little monkeys slap each other and I'm laughing.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:17.540
 And my wife turns to me and she says, you always laugh at monkeys. And I was like, what? Yeah,

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:26.020
 whenever monkeys do funny things, you laugh. And later I was like, that is a habit I definitely

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:37.580
 did not know I had. Funny monkeys. But for her it was like so obvious. It was just like

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:46.860
 point blank. Like you always laugh at monkeys. This is such a trivial habit. It's so easy

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.320
 because we're so habituated to look outside and always assess because it's not threatening

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.500
 to me, to my frames. I don't have to change anything if I just stand on the sidelines

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.500
 and judge and say this is this opinion and that should be this way and change this policy

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:06.660
 and allocate this here and that shouldn't be red, it should be white. It's so easy.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:15.620
 We're tuned to look out through all this hardware and try to say that my way is the right way

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.020
 and it should be this way. It's really hard to see those frames in ourselves. And when

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.660
 we put ourselves in a system like Vajrayana or like Buddhism, the system is designed to

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:35.220
 help us see what we're doing. This cognitive behavioral scientist defined wisdom which

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:42.980
 was so interesting in the Western canon like Sophia. Wisdom is the metacognitive capacity

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:54.280
 to see self-deception. I can see when I'm fooling myself, to see a limit I have and

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:02.980
 then to witness it from outside and not fall for it again. Wisdom. And Buddhism can be

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.740
 defined really as an unmasking or as a seeing clearly of removing the obscurations and having

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:21.020
 our true nature shine brightly as it is without being obstructed by self-deception. And so

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.740
 this process of looking at me, at me, what am I doing, how am I reacting both alone and

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:35.940
 with other people, what am I saying, what am I not saying, showing up kindly, harmoniously,

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:46.420
 with good timing, how much am I doing that with people, with myself, how timely is my

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:52.220
 internal critique of myself, when do I see something that's helpful to see and so I can

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.460
 do something about it or just another way of pushing myself down. The Buddha taught

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:06.340
 all this Sheela, this methods of ethics and these techniques of samadhi in this wisdom.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.940
 And in Vajrayana it's really like to some degree when we say Vajrayana it's like there's

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:19.640
 the promise that in a single lifetime we can be free of suffering. We can fully achieve

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:25.740
 a transcendental wisdom rainbow body. We can fully be natural, just be who we are, see

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.940
 what we didn't see before because we couldn't see in that way. Our scene wasn't lined up

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:37.280
 with all the full spectrum of what was there to be seen. Or you could see it as co-creating

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:45.140
 reality the way we saw squeezed everything and we saw the squeezed version of everything

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:52.340
 through our box, through our vision, through our funnel. And Vajrayana's saying full spectrum

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:58.340
 receive feedback of the entire span and spectrum of experience in life. And what we pray, it's

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.980
 a common Vajrayana pray, it's a common Mahayana, like tantra, or sorry Sutra Mahayana prayer,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:14.300
 may all the negative karma of all beings ripen on me now. And when we pray that, what do

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:24.060
 we think is going to happen? If we really take this seriously, that is going to be a really

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:35.500
 big headache. That is going to be, that wish coming true is going to really rock our boat.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.980
 All the karma of all beings ripen on me now. So they can be freed. It's such a kind compassionate

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:54.380
 prayer. It's just the, Bodhicitta is the bedrock lowest common denominator of all tantra practice

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.720
 in Buddhism. Bodhicitta, the lowest common denominator, what always has to be there every

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:05.860
 single time is Bodhicitta. Any question we have, the answer is Bodhicitta. Any problem

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:12.620
 we get into, the answer is Bodhicitta. Then the question is unpacking Bodhicitta in a

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.540
 way that's appropriate to our experience now that can really support us to look further,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:26.100
 to live more fully, to feel more fully, to release more fully, to relax more fully. And

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:32.980
 I can't do that. I'm just totally a little person on the path or like many people. And

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:41.460
 it feels like I'm just putting a name to the experience. I think it really serves a purpose

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:47.380
 to not pretend like Vajrayana is a honeymoon and that's all it is. Because if you stay

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:54.940
 on the path for a not very long period of time and we get triggered, intentionally triggered,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:02.380
 we get upended. We get uncertain. The technique itself pushes us to grow. It pushes us to

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:10.860
 open and like laugh, laugh at ourselves, to lighten up. When that happens and it happens

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:16.780
 again and it happens again and these subtle habits that are really difficult to release,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:24.540
 when the actual meat of the path happens, we'll have been given a heads up. This is

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:32.700
 it working. This is the path working. And then it becomes really critically important

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.820
 to distinguish what does me actually going on the path and like opening up and freeing

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:49.460
 up and getting clear and soft and bodhicitta full and what is me just like getting hurt

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:58.940
 by samsara. This again and again because we're good at that. So how can we distinguish when

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:05.660
 it's actually we're going on the path and we're actually it's opening or we're just

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:11.300
 stuck in a rut and we're spinning our wheels and it feels like friction but it's not really

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:19.140
 going anywhere on the path. It's just spinning wheels because they both feel bad. No, it's

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.660
 not all not all bad. There's like such amazing insights because what the release of seeing

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.060
 bigger of loving more fully. It's so wonderful to have a session that's really soaked in

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.500
 bodhicitta to have a minute of it. It's like so nourishing. Remember she says that's the

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:42.060
 supreme medicine to have a moment of bodhicitta. It fixes all ills. So then that question that's

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.380
 like a question I leave with how do we know when we're just spinning our wheels and it's

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:55.180
 just the tension of like just like my way of basically of not getting my way. I'm a

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.220
 Buddhist. I'm going on the path and all this and it's just I'm not getting my way and so

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:05.620
 I'm like shaking versus I'm a Buddhist. I'm on the path. I'm really trying to apply the

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:12.660
 instructions and like this it feels it's it's hard. It like feels sticky. These habits to

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.260
 release. It's like difficult work. Anyone who's gone on retreat is difficult to stay

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.780
 with it. It's difficult to put our mind somewhere and like let its energy come out naturally

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:30.540
 and see how it is so energetic and to stay with the technique long enough for it to actually

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:38.020
 transform us is difficult. But one thing Vajrayana and all this Buddhism should do is increase

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:47.420
 our agency. Increase my sense of responsibility and like I can do this and I deserve this.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:53.100
 I'm worth it. In this situation there are ways that this is workable and so I'm going

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.580
 to keep I'm going to sit down again on this cushion or I'm going to say this mantra or

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.580
 I'm going to like actually listen to someone instead of just kind of like bouncing against

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:09.380
 them like all these things are Dharma practices like Dharma should definitely increase our

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.780
 own internal resilience and our internal confidence in their little windows where that kind of

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.460
 dark night of the soul feeling of like really being broken open to like actually grow new

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.420
 bones and like actually grow like it can all these kind of questions can come up to questions

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.260
 of devotion and questions of connection and all that and it's only student Rinpoche and

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.460
 mountain retreat instructions really clearly says these are signs that we should stick

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.740
 to our practice. Guru Rinpoche said our sadhana practice we should never give up until we

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:46.060
 attain enlightenment. We can't throw out the relative supports. We'll keep doing nundra

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:53.140
 until we get enlightened because we can never give up the lowest common denominator of bodhicitta.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.700
 Then at that point it'll just be unfabricated natural bodhicitta. We won't have to work

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.580
 at it. It'll just come through us because that's all this is and we just won't get in

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:12.540
 the way. My way will be all beings way and we'll just naturally reflect for others benefit.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.940
 It should definitely lighten up the path like in a longer view not just a hard day of practice

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:24.860
 but in a longer view we should get more like light more seeing from different perspectives

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:30.900
 not just my version but really all these different versions their story her story his story its

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.580
 story all these versions we should start to get more flexible with seeing this and how

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:42.860
 we see ourselves not just one same old repeated story of ourself. It should start to get more

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.980
 dynamic more vibrant a little more playful. That's definitely an indication that the tension

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:55.060
 is actually healthy dynamic tension. It's not stuck. It's not kind of banging against anything

00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:06.100
 or rigidly kind of unwilling to change. Those are a few thoughts. I think really doing the

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:12.380
 whole cooking in the Vajrayana soup really being under the guidance of a realized master

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:18.940
 in an authentic lineage. It's the really one thing that Vajrayana and I'm so thankful in

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:24.300
 the 21st century. There's so much on the table now to look at these perspectives how to create

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:30.460
 communities that are like scalable enough. It's the right. It's the right amount of support.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.980
 It's not too much coddling. It's like these inquiries that aren't just heady propositional

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:43.100
 ways of knowing but they're performative enacted extended embodied communicative grounded practices

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:49.700
 like Vajrayana has all this. Vajrayana was Buddha taught this a long time ago all these

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:57.860
 ways of knowing perspectival knowing performative knowing participatory knowing putting ourself

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.580
 in a state of uncertainty and staying there seeing things clearly like propositional ways

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:12.820
 of knowing studying the scriptures applying the teachings in practice that's a beauty

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.740
 of the Buddha Dharma especially the Vajrayana teachings is that we can take all these new

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.580
 insights that are coming from all these wonderful myriad perspectives of people really deep

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:28.060
 research and really curious new ways of looking at things emergent voices that haven't been

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.420
 allowed to be shared that we can take these bits of insight and look at Vajrayana with

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:41.580
 them and Vajrayana has nothing to fear it will only enhance our appreciation of the

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:47.500
 profound techniques and realization that the Buddha shared with us with these Vajrayana

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:55.100
 methodologies I have I definitely have no doubt about that the more I look in the very

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.620
 little time I've looked it only keeps opening and then the question is how much am I willing

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:07.260
 to open and we don't have to just rip ourselves open because that's not a path that is emergency

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:14.160
 room time we need to gradually let it happen organically and it means putting the time

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.460
 in and keeping doing it and being kind enough that we that we hold ourselves accountable

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:26.680
 to the lineage we keep going soft but firm we ask for help when we need it we check in

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.740
 with our teachers when when we need it we check in with Sangha sisters and brothers

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:36.980
 when we need it we check our own minds when we need it and then little by little the path

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.220
 will open and deepen because we'll open and deepen and it'll only be so much gratitude

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.620
 and appreciation for this and it's not the end the final answer I know it's going long

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:55.340
 here but the final answer isn't Buddhism for everyone or Vajrayana for everyone that's

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:02.940
 not at all what I'm saying I'm just saying how fortunate we are we're in a system we're

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:10.740
 in this amazing system of teachings that have been tried and tested by all these beings

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:17.540
 and they're like shining exemplars of achieving the pinnacle of human potential full actualization

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:23.380
 of enlightenment and they keep coming back to help and all their life stories are just

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:29.140
 these beautiful examples of like how do I engage when obstacles come up when challenges

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:36.020
 come up because all their life stories are just filled with being of with overcoming

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:43.660
 and in dealing with obstacles and pick a life story of one of these great masters they really

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:49.340
 had the courage and the stamina and the commitment and the flexibility the kindness to themselves

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.500
 and others to keep with it for all beings because we're trying to serve all beings and

00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:01.740
 we can only serve all beings when we connect to all beings the way they are not the way

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:07.460
 I want them to be or my the Buddhist version of them but actually on the ground how is

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.380
 someone feeling how are they suffering how are they beautiful how are they offering this

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:19.340
 shining creative insight we connect with that not with some you know fantasize pretend version

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.780
 of how Buddhism needs to be everywhere and that's answered everything or something silly

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:29.700
 like that because minds are so different our habits are so different the each of our paths

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:35.100
 is so different but we're so fortunate to be in this set of practices like this nundra

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:43.220
 practice with these living teachers and this lineage of teachers and we have this connection

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.900
 and like it's so valuable to keep fostering the connection to keep fostering it and when

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.980
 it dims and when it gets a little weak or we get a little hazy or we get confused or

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:58.740
 overwhelmed or too stressed or just the daily grind thing that we really keep in mind like

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:04.460
 how precious this this is this opportunity this system our connection we really keep

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:12.780
 that as a central kind of core thing in our lives that this whole these techniques are

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.300
 available for us and we can keep applying them and it's only going to enhance our life

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:23.300
 and we just have to be patient enough to go like technique by technique recipe by recipe

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:36.380
 and check in am I doing it according to the lineage instructions not because it's a set

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.740
 in stone set of instructions is eighty four thousand teachings it's three million four

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:47.900
 hundred thousand tantras so chin tantras is a lot of different recipes and it all came

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:54.420
 to the Buddha but right now for me what's appropriate what rings true how can I soften

00:35:54.420 --> 00:36:00.980
 how can I open up how can I use this challenge this tension of like just not wanting to grow

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.020
 more you know of being comfortable enough you know so near a bitch a he said there's

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.260
 a big difference in the amount of effort to use Dharma to just have a pretty good worldly

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:17.820
 life compared to how much effort it takes to get on the first booming path of seeing

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:24.740
 that if we get on the first boomy then we can really serve beings will never make the

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:34.300
 mistake of demanding my way again we'll just love beings though as they are and we'll do

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:42.820
