NOTE     "synopsis": "A new Buddhist meditation retreat center beckons in Jupiter, Florida!\n\nPalden Sherab Pema Ling is located on ten-acres of land that includes a pond, numerous trees, fields, and wetlands that are enjoyed by abundant local wildlife.\n\nWe\u2019ve already begun construction of the main meditation temple. The horse barns are being converted into a temple, meditation sanctuary, and fellowship hall, and the land will be preserved as a park-like setting for contemplative walks, meditation, or simply sitting in quiet reflection.\n\nThe Palm Beach Dharma Center\u2014a local branch of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\u2014is looking for funding to create this beautiful sanctuary. It will be a place for spiritual rejuvenation to promote natural beauty where outer peace and harmony, foster inner healing and tranquility. Its namesake is Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, one of the great Tibetan Buddhist masters and scholars of the 20th century. He and his brother, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, long dreamed of creating a Buddhist retreat center in South Florida.\n\nWith the help of your kindness and generosity, this dream could now become a reality.\n\nDonate here: www.gofundme.com/f/develop-dharma-center-in-jupiter-fl\n\nPlease visit the Palm Beach Dharma Center website for more details: www.pbdc.net/palden-sherab-pema-ling-retreat-center \n\nThe International website of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center: www.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820
 Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche have been coming

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.680
 to South Florida every year for over 30 years. In that time they have nurtured a growing community

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.900
 of students and established a thriving Dharma center in the town of Lake Worth Beach. They

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 had always dreamed of creating a retreat center in the beautiful Florida countryside, a place

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.800
 for tranquil reflection, deep meditation, and authentic retreat. In 2014 that dream began

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 to manifest when we found the land that would become Palden Sherab Pema Ling, Lotus Land

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 of Glorious Wisdom, named after Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, who passed into Palden

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.880
 Gervana in 2010. A little over 10 acres, with a cypress grove, three pole barns and a house,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.900
 and hundreds of trees, Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche saw what it could become.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.840
 After careful planning and preparation, we worked together to transform the property,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.580
 creating hundreds of new plantings and a beautiful Buddha garden. We are enclosing the middle

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:37.360
 barn to create a temple, opening up the interior space and bringing in the natural light. We

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.240
 hope to unveil this beautiful temple by the end of the year, offering a new and unique

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.760
 home for the Buddha Dharma here in South Florida. We welcome you to join us on this journey

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.320
 and to contribute to our efforts in whatever way feels best for you. Thank you.
