00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 The awareness is ordinary. Ordinary is nothing changed. Why is it called ordinary? It is nothing

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.670
 changed, nothing publicated. We are not trying to make something. It is un-publicated, ordinary,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.000
 naturally flowing systems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.650
 This is the ultimate nature or the realization of the old tour ones, or the Buddha Shaptamuni, or

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.490
 the Buddha Samyantabata, or the Guru Pema Samyant. This is, this is, and this is again, free from

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.000
 all the ages or the extremes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.040
 It is pervasive, openness nature, nature, nature, nature. We have to behold this nature without any

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.000
 effort, without hospice. Relax with joy and appreciation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.650
 To start to behold this nature, with great joy and devotion. Devotion and joy are important. App

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.000
reciation and devotion are all important to start these practices. Devotion is so important.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.910
 You know, always in the teachings, without devotion, the light won't shine in our nature of the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.800
 mind, or the light not come out. Joy, it is completely covered, covered with all the joy, without

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.000
 the devotions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.010
 But when we have the stone devotions, that duality thickness began to loosen. Loosening began to

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:42.000
 shine. The primordial wasn't light from our heart, in our realization. That really shines.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 For that reason, devotion is so important in the teachings said, along with bodhicata and joy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.420
 What is devotion? Of course, you all know, we all know that. Devotion is joy, combination with joy

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 and appreciation and love. That is, that richness is important.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.520
 Where that comes from, again, is the discipline of the Rupa. It is a vastness. Devotion is not

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.900
 something kind of, again, unneeded and unkind of wanted or big in the kind of tools that we have to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.000
 do.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.690
 It is love, it is appreciation, it is joy, it is vastness of Dharmakaya, expression of Dharmakaya,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.000
 or is it Sambukaya? It is Narmakaya.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Narmakaya. We need to reveal our depth of Dharmakaya, Kaya that devotions.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.960
 And then, even that, with that, start with the meditation, the practice of the Okimariya. With that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.000
, and then relax. Relax. And keep, keep the contract.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.780
 All that we learned, liberated, let it come, let it go. We are not going to conquer in the thoughts

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.000
. We are not going to water in the thoughts.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.500
 Thought, energetic thought comes. We are going to be free, carefree. Those are the instructions

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.000
 said. Again and again.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 And here, for that reason, if you do something kind of with the, with the, with the effort, effort

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:23.650
 kind of analyzing and effort meditating, meditating, that will not discover and see the true nature

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.000
 of the mind.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.360
 That's not going to see the true nature of the mind. That's what clearly, loudly says here in the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.000
 teaching set.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.800
 For that reason, don't do anything. Particularly, just relax. And don't analyze anything. Once you

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:52.000
 recognize the nature of the mind, once you see, we discuss the world.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.360
 Once you see what is the world, we discuss today. And you know that now. And then we don't have to

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.000
 analyze again and again. There's nothing to more analyze.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.120
 It's all conceptions. Conceptions. So, don't analyze. Don't think. Ordinary, this nature is going

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.000
 to discover by, by relaxing nature.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.580
 Reality level, there is nothing to be also relaxed. Relaxed. And nothing, not too relaxed. Nothing

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.000
 destructive, no destructive.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.800
 It's all display of the dharmakai. All dharmakai. Be in that nature status. That. And when you

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.000
 discover that nature, nature, there's no need to be any effort.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It's beyond effort and not effort. How wonderful. How beautiful. How great joy it is.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Those people who are kind of always grasping to be thoughtless. Thoughtless or kind of like

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.660
 completely, kind of preferent thought. Thinking of that. Then they are caught by the thought itself

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.000
.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.770
 So, thinking of the, no thought. I have kind of thinking of grasping and holding on the, on the no

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.300
 thought. Then, kind of like when thought comes, then suddenly they start to kind of, all the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.550
 thoughts are, thoughts are like kind of moving in the different directions or wondering all the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.000
 different directions.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.800
 Reality level, this rupa is beyond the coming and beyond the going. When you relax in that natural

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:49.680
 status, then stay and be careful. Careful and be safe, be safe in that natural status or stay in

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.000
 this natural status.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 So, again, he said, all the noble son and daughter, daughter must be recognized of these systems.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.520
 And therefore, again, once again, there's nothing to meditate. Even once like this, but be, be

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.000
 aware of the nature as it is without destructive. Without destructive.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.880
 Without destructive, without carried by the thoughts. Big thought, subtle thought or whatever

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.000
 thought. Don't let that carry by thoughts. Thought. That is meditating.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So, that is really about the, I think they say, 18 or the 19 songs.
