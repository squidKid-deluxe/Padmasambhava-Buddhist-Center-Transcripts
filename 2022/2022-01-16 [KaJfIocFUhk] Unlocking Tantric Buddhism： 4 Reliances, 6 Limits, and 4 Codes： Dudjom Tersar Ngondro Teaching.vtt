NOTE     "synopsis": "Brief Teaching and Practice on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nwith Lama Dragpa\n\n\"Unlocking Tantric Buddhism: 4 Reliances, 6 Limits, and 4 Codes\"\n\nSaturday, January 15, 2022\n3:30-5:30pm EDT\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n(1) Don\u2019t rely on the person, rely on the teaching.\n(2) Don\u2019t rely on the words, rely on the meaning.\n(3) Don\u2019t rely on the provisional meaning, rely on the definitive, ultimate meaning.\n(4) Don\u2019t rely on conceptual mind, rely on wisdom.\n\nThe Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches summarize the essence of the four reliances in \"Opening the Wisdom Door of the Rangtong & Shentong Views\" (pgs 42-43):\n\n\"Buddha Shakyamuni himself said that we should analyze his teachings as though carefully examining gold to determine its quality. This is why we must study, contemplate, and meditate upon his teachings in order to discover their deep meaning. For this reason, he taught the \u2018four reliances\u2019 in the Sutra of Inexhaustible Knowledge, or Lodro Mizepe Shupai Do, named after the bodhisattva Lodro Mizepe who requested it. The Tibetan world for \u2018trust\u2019 or \u2018rely\u2019 is tonpa [rton pa]. In these sutras, Buddha Shakyamuni explained, \u2018We should rely on the teachings in four different ways.\u2019 (1) First, we should not trust or rely on individuals, but instead rely on the teachings. (2) Second, we should not rely on the words of Dharma teachings, but instead rely on their meaning. (3) Third, we should not rely on the provisional meaning of the teachings, but instead rely on the definitive meaning. (4) The fourth reliance is based upon two types of definitive meaning: definitive meaning as it is understood by conceptual mind and definitive meaning as it is understood by wisdom mind. So, fourth, we should rely on the definitive meaning with wisdom mind rather than conceptual mind. These four reliances have been taught by many different Buddhist masters throughout history.\"\n\nIn \"Tara\u2019s Enlightened Activity: An Oral Commentary on the Twenty-one Praises to Tara\" (35-37), the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches further explain the \u201csix limits\u201d and \u201cfour codes\" with a quick overview:\n\n\"Each of Buddha\u2019s tantric teachings is very profound, having multiple levels on which to examine truths and many ways to reveal the true nature of the mind. The goal is always to bring ourselves and all living beings to enlightenment and to bring joy and peace.\n\n A tantra may thus have meanings on many levels. Some meanings will be accessible to ordinary beings living in a particular time and place; other meanings are only understandable to beings that are at stages farther along the path to enlightenment. In fact, some meanings are only to be understood and applied by bodhisattvas or buddhas who have reached enlightenment and are actively bringing everyone to the enlightened state. If we only rely on our ordinary point of view when trying to make sense of tantra, some misunderstanding could occur. Therefore, receiving the pith instructions directly from a qualified lineage holder is the key to opening the total meaning of the teaching.\n\n Then to unlock this essential meaning of the tantra, the pith instructions, we must follow a series of methods. These are known as the \u201csix limits\u201d and the \u201cfour systems, or meanings.\u201d These ten approaches taken all together will bring out the perfect, accurate meaning of the tantra. The six limits are pervasive. They apply to how we understand the text as a whole. However, we apply the four systems directly to the interpretation of each word and line.\"\n\n---\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\n\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha. They are a perfect and complete framework for cultivating a balanced, effective, and rewarding spiritual practice.We\u2019ll also get to practice the entire Ngondro every session!\n\nLearn More:\n\nIn \"Illuminating the Path,\" Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche give clear and profound explanations on how to practice the path of Ngondro \u2013 the foundational set of practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book includes line-by-line commentary on the concise Dudjom Tersar Ngondro revealed by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, detailed instructions on how to practice, and helpful visual illustrations. It is both deep and accessible pointing out how we can see our fundamentally enlightened nature.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 Warm greetings, friends. Warm greetings. If everyone could please, we'd just reconnect

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.940
 to our motivation, bring a deep sense of gratitude and kind of refreshed, present joyfulness

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.120
 to being able to come together and reflect on the teachings of the Buddha and Guru Rinpoche

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.920
 and the lineage masters and then to put them into practice. So bring up that really deep

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.380
 heartfelt kind of sense of appreciation for the opportunity. And then in addition to that,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.580
 I really have this motivation that all the benefit that comes from doing that, connecting

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.300
 to these teachings and applying them in our lives, that the benefit really immediately

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.900
 benefits and goes out to all beings everywhere, every single one, and provides them with whatever

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.860
 they need to be happy, and then ultimately whatever they need to be completely free and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:18.940
 achieve enlightenment. So awaken that bodhicitta view, actual experience, and then thirdly,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:27.220
 this pure view of Vajrayana to see that everything is naturally divine. All the forms, sounds,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.740
 and thoughts, emotions, movements of mind, they're all naturally, just as they are, fine,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 natural, pure. So trying to see this view, kind of bring up that, activate that kind

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 of sense of pure view in our minds right now. And with this renunciation, bodhicitta and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 pure view kind of really take a moment to enliven that.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.320
 Thank you. It's always a really humbling experience to get to be here and say something

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.140
 about Dharma. It's like such a tremendous, really big responsibility. And I'm always

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 just in way over my head, because the Dharma is so vast and profound. So that's just the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 reality of it. And then kind of fulfilling the request. I've come to Rumba Chay to kind

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.980
 of be here for these ongoing Dudham Taresananda practices, with kind of little introductory

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.660
 remarks. So kind of trying to fulfill that to my best capabilities, and just kind of,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.020
 yeah, with really good intentions. So trying to reactivate that myself. And then each time

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.980
 it's kind of seen, I kind of feel this kind of pressure of it, like what to offer this

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.220
 time, what's going to be really helpful. And that's always, I don't know, kind of, I take

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.860
 that kind of question seriously for myself. So I didn't really know this time. It's kind

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.820
 of a little difficult. And I kind of honed in on something, but I'm kind of always trying

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.860
 to think in my mind, like what could really be helpful? Like amidst all the teachings that

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.300
 these great noble beings have taught, and all these books, all these opportunities we

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.500
 have to connect to the Dharma, like what, you know, what's, what would be helpful now? And

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.300
 so it kind of becomes a question of what supports are there that for people beginning on the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:01.100
 path, continuing on the path, like what, what's been helpful for me? Because yeah, it's involved.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.100
 To open the heart is really involved, and to be vulnerable and available and sensitive

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.620
 and humble, and to try to be receptive and responsive to circumstances, to people, as

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 we all go through our ups and downs and have different moods and inspirations and difficulties

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.180
 come up. You know, it's, what's helpful, what serves is a really big bodhisattva question.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.580
 And something that I've connected with for years, just in this small little, you know,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.940
 baby steps I've taken on the path, is these four alliances. So that's kind of the main

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.100
 topic I thought to just kind of reflect on a little bit in our brief time together is

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.540
 the four alliances taught by the Buddha. And these are essential foundational teachings

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.460
 honored and held, maintained from the foundational Buddhism all the way up through Tibetan Buddhism

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.620
.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.460
 And the Buddha said to have taught this in the Sutra of inexhaustible knowledge, these

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.820
 four alliances. And they're kind of to some degree just today is like to think of all

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.420
 the great variety and the richness that the Buddha's teachings offer, 84,000 teachings

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.900
 and the millions of tantras like kind of to have some keys that will help unlock or kind

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.540
 of distill some essential fundamental kind of first principles or like really key points

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.340
 that amidst all the variety to always, we can always come back to and rely on and trust

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:43.300
 in that they were, they're reliable. So here, this topic is the four alliances. And just

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.020
 kind of a lot of this talk kind of in just this idea that I'm referring to comes from

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.020
 Venerable Kempa Ramachas. They have, they discussed this in many of their books, especially in

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.380
 their Shedra series, the Rong Tong and Shen Tong View book, they talk about the four alliances,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.980
 then also in their outer tantras, the outer tantra commentary, opening the wisdom, opening

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.580
 the door to the outer tantras, as well as the Giyugarbha books. So there's a lot of

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.660
 teachings on the four alliances and what these are and our own teachers, Venerable Kempa

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.520
 Ramachas have taught them, they've emphasized the importance of these teachings quite a

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.340
 lot. And so there's, this is just a little peeking into a door that goes into a vast

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.780
 terrain and territory. So that's well worth kind of going into further. We're just kind

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.820
 of a little peeking through into that door today. And so the first reliance is don't rely

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:46.820
 on the teacher, rely on the teachings. The second reliance, the second reliance is don't

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:57.820
 rely on the words, rely on the meaning. The third reliance is don't rely on the provisional

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:07.980
 meaning or the interpretable meaning, but rely on the definitive meaning. And then fourthly,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:19.640
 the fourth reliance is don't rely on conceptual mind, but rely on wisdom awareness. So these

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:27.000
 are the four alliances that the Buddha taught us. What is worthy of our trust of reliance?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.860
 Don't rely on the teacher, but the teachings. Don't rely on the words, but their meaning.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.700
 Not the provisional meaning, but the definitive meaning. And not our conceptual mind, our

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:46.540
 dualistic kind of mind, but our wisdom, wisdom awareness. These are the four alliances. Then

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.460
 I find this is like a way to go deeper and deeper into the teachings and to let ourselves

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.980
 absorb these teachings more richly, more thoroughly. So this first reliance, don't rely on the

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:04.620
 teacher, but the teachings. Then here, this is like such a big teaching that the Buddha

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:11.940
 taught that to not take, to not trust in the validity of something just because a famous

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:18.620
 person said it or a charismatic person or they're beautiful or popular, renowned, alleged

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:27.500
 expert or it's like a very popular opinion, but look for yourself. Really test it. Test

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.260
 the validity, not just based on someone who has a position of authority or a position

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:44.260
 of power, but really look for yourself. That this is so important to kind of, as Buddhists,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.780
 to go beyond the idea that, you know, we just kind of always put blind faith in someone

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.660
 else and just say yes. That the Buddha was so clear that this is not how the path of

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:00.900
 enlightenment or liberation happens. We really have to do this process of awakening ourselves.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:08.500
 Our own mind has to wake up. Our own heart has to open up. And so we really fully have

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.580
 to engage this process. And while having great guides like the Buddha is so important and

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.460
 can save us so much time and so much wasted time by having a real expert kind of give

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.340
 us key points to look after, like the Four Reliances, then we really still have to apply

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.140
 them for ourselves. Just as Buddhists, it's good to emphasize that point and kind of keep

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.420
 coming back. This has to be a lived experience of one's own self. We're not worshiping it

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:46.220
 in anyone. This is not a theistic path. We're relying on other testimony and other advice,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.100
 but we're always testing it for ourselves in our own experience and with our own logic.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:10:00.100
 Trying to use all our faculties to really see for ourselves what's the truth. So what's

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:09.180
 the Dharma? So this is the first reliance to put. I'm doing these very quickly. Don't rely

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:18.540
 on the teacher, but the teaching. The Dharma is what's principle. Then secondly, don't

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:27.940
 just rely on the words of the teaching, but go into the meaning of the words. And here

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:36.900
 we have to open up our inquiry. We can't just rely on a literal meaning of words. We can't

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:43.060
 just repeat something like a parrot. We can't just give the most obvious. The most obvious

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:49.340
 and tangible isn't necessarily the most true. The Buddha is saying there's much more subtle

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:57.540
 levels of meaning in the teachings. And we have to keep looking and keep opening ourselves

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:04.500
 to those subtler levels of meaning and to see in those more and more subtle ways. Not

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:13.300
 as obvious, not as literal. We need to see some of the implicit meaning. And that's a

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.820
 lot of work to really try to look at a topic, look at teachings from various angles. This

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.100
 contemplation is really required of us to really reflect things and test them and see

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.780
 if they're true and see if the opposite is true and really debate the teaching and try

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:37.740
 it on for ourselves. That the Buddha is asking us to do that, to really engage the teaching.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.260
 Not just as a kind of something we just believe in, like oh blind faith to a text now. Not

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.740
 a teacher, but a text. Just believe in the text. The Buddha said no, there's so many

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:52.740
 levels of meaning to these texts. And we have to really get more of a faculty for going

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:58.580
 deeper into the meaning. And then we need to have that question of like how can I access

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:07.260
 deeper levels of meaning and how can I assess them? The validity of those deeper levels.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.220
 It's not enough just to go deeper. We have to still make sense of it. It's not enough

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.580
 to see subtler patterns. We have to actually make sense of them. How do I interpret these

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:25.020
 subtler patterns? And then so that leads us to the third reliance. Don't rely on just

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:35.860
 the provisional meaning, but rely on the definitive meaning. This is a big topic in Buddhism.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:41.180
 What does provisional mean? Or interpretable? It basically, it means that the Buddha was

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.060
 like the Buddha wasn't saying it the way enlightened beings see things. They were kind of dumbing

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:52.500
 it down a little bit. Or kind of making it a little more digestible. Zogg-Sarkhan Surimache

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:59.380
 sometimes jokingly called these like Cinderella stories. The Buddha told us stories that fit

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.300
 more easily with our habitual expectations and our habits. So that it would be easier

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:13.460
 for us to digest them. These truths, the provisional truths, it only is true up to a certain point.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.540
 It's partially true. And once we get to that point, then that edge of the context where

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.900
 it's relevant, that truth, then all of a sudden that truth becomes, we see a limit of the

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.900
 truth, a limit of a position. And this is very much goes and is related to middle way

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:40.900
 Midyamaka teachings. On the relative level, any position, any standpoint, any boundary

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.300
 we make, there's something that it leaves out. It always has an opposite. It always

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:52.100
 omits. And in that omission is a distortion. We need to make healthy boundaries. We need

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.700
 to have healthy definitions, really clear minded thinking and very kind of grounded

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:04.820
 feeling. But any time we orient in a certain way, there's some way we're not orienting.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.340
 So we're leaving something out or we're highlighting one part at the expense of another. It's just

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:17.260
 how relative reality works. It's how duality mind functions. And so all these are provisional.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:25.020
 That's provisional. Only goes so far. A truth that only is true to an extent. Contextually

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:33.500
 true. So it's context bound truth. And so then definitive truth would be true in all

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:42.940
 cases. Or true that the way an enlightened fully realized being experiences things unmistakably,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:50.740
 they're not kind of, they're not having to like present it in a way that suits sentient

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:58.180
 beings' needs and views and dispositions. They're just saying the truth as it is unmistakably,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:03.860
 the way it's experienced from an awakened enlightened perspective. This is definitive

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:13.340
 teaching. So in this level of the Reliances, not the provisional meaning but the definitive

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:20.140
 one, here we can see that assumed in this, there's a spectrum of relative truths. And

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:27.620
 relative reality, everything is partially true. But there is a sequence of partial truths

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:36.860
 that get less and less partially true or more and more fully true until they're definitive.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:47.220
 So this is a big point. That it's saying that not all opinions are equal. That what's helpful,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:55.820
 what's true is always context bound. But certain truths are more true than others. They include

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:03.620
 more truth. They have a bigger, more inclusive context. They cover, they include more evidence.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:10.620
 They're more well tested. There's more testimony. There's better data. There's a spectrum of

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:19.740
 truths. This is all on relative level. And eventually that leads us into definitive truth.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.940
 So here it's positing, there is a definitive truth, the way that an unmistaken way of experiencing

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:42.660
 reality. And this leads us to the fourth reliance. Rely on wisdom awareness, not on conceptual

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:54.220
 mind. Saying the only way to experience definitive truth is through wisdom, prajna, wisdom

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.620
 awareness.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:02.780
 Not just duality, conceptual mind. Intellectual argumentation. Kind of relative positions

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:13.080
 of any kind. But to see the unchanging nature of wisdom awareness. That's the fourth reliance.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:18.940
 To use our own wisdom as the way we engage all of our experience. That eventually that's

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.980
 where the path is leading us. We're relying on our wisdom from moment to moment to moment

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.100
 to moment. Not our kind of fabricated duality mind that always has opinions and preferences

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:38.960
 and just by nature excludes things. But our wisdom. The wisdom to see beyond this exclusionary

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:46.660
 way of experiencing things. Wisdom. So that again is a very big topic to distinguish between

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:57.220
 Sam and Rigpa. Our conceptual mind and non-conceptual wisdom. Such a big topic. But this is where

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:04.740
 the path is leading us. To wisdom. Our own wisdom. Showing us our own wisdom. Our own

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:13.140
 open mind. And here we can see that the Buddha who taught this some 2,600 years ago was so

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:25.220
 ahead of his time. He's still ahead of our times. He's so amazingly, radically awakened.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:34.020
 He's so far beyond. That we all have this wisdom awareness. It can see definitive truth.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.660
 It can see relative truth with all of its variety and distinctions so precisely and

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:45.780
 so clearly. It can see the literal truth and it can see all the different types of authorities.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.580
 All the different people to believe in. The different types of testimonies. The Buddha

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:56.180
 can see all of this and he's giving us a path step by step with what we can rely on so that

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:04.900
 we can eventually come down to really like seeing for ourselves the way reality is. And

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:15.820
 not at the exclusion of our relationships but by using them. By using what we experience.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:22.180
 To go deeper. To open up more. To absorb more. So these are the four alliances taught by

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:31.130
 the extraordinary, gracious, so kind, compassionately wise Buddha. It's been upheld in all the

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.620
 traditions

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:38.380
 of Buddhism. These foundational teachings in all of Sutra Mahayana and Tantra Mahayana.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:44.340
 And then here we get into this next kind of set or series of kind of clear distinctions

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:51.580
 when we look at this third reliance of provisional and definitive. Not provisional truth but

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.540
 definitive and this is something I just wanted to quickly mention. It's like such a big doorway

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:05.940
 or entry into like such a vast amazingly special landscape of Vajrayana. And that's what's

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.980
 talked about often by these great masters including Venerable Kambaramaches. The six

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:21.200
 limits and the four codes. These are very renowned Vajrayana teachings. They're ways

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.860
 of like assessing the meaning of the Vajrayana pit instructions accurately. And like opening

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:34.340
 the meaning more and more vastly, more deeply. So that our practice and our path can be more

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:41.300
 thorough. The four codes, the six limits. Venerable Kambaramaches, they mention these

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.980
 in almost each of their Shirdra books. And it's just like a little key way that can like

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.860
 kind of locate, it can locate an experience or a view a little more kind of like fully

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:58.220
 so that we can unpack the meaning and like you utilize it a little more easily. So these

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.280
 are like keys. They're not like more numerical number things just to remember and get more

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.420
 confused by. They're actually like these distilled essential kind of keys that unlock or open

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.730
 the kind of deeper meanings of all these teachings. And then specifically this is related to Vajray

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:12.980
ana

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:23.180
 or the Tantra in Buddhism. And first the four codes. This also was taught by His Holiness

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:30.700
 the Dalai Lama and a book of his and published in 1995 called World of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:36.220
 an overview of its philosophy and practice. That's by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. So

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.080
 this is some 26 years ago in English. These teachings on four codes and six limits are

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.460
 not new. Buddha taught them a long time ago. They've been published in English language

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:52.220
 for English speakers for quite some time now. So this is all readily available to look more

00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:01.300
 into if we want to. And so these four codes to begin with as like said to be the word

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:09.920
 meaning is the first. And then the second is a general meaning. The third is the hidden

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:21.380
 meaning. And the fourth is the ultimate meaning. And these are levels of meaning in the Tantras.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:27.340
 The word meaning, general meaning, hidden meaning, ultimate meaning. We can apply this

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:35.340
 to nundra practice. We can apply this to any Tibetan Buddha's teaching. And here, Kambara

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.940
 Rinpoche is in two of their books on the great noble lady Tara. Smile of Sun and Moon and

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:46.100
 Tara's Enlightened Activity. They go through these four codes and six limits very extensively.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.060
 And specifically in these two Tara books, the whole book is designed or each of these

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.740
 books, they're both designed around these four codes. The four levels of meaning of

00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:01.180
 the 21 praises of Tara. Word meaning, general, hidden, and ultimate. That's what each of

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:07.220
 the chapters, it breaks into these four ways of understanding, unpacking, unlocking, accessing

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.020
 the meaning of the teachings in our own experience. So this is a very renowned way to understand

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:21.620
 teachings. And the word meaning is just a literal meaning. What do the words specifically

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:30.540
 say? It's very zoomed in and very specific. And then the second, and I'm just going through

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:35.100
 this really quickly, the second meaning is a general meaning and takes a much broader

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.060
 view of the specific text that we're looking at, the fifth instruction. Where does it fit

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:49.780
 in all the range of the Buddha's teachings? What's the general theme of the teaching?

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.620
 Not just the words or the phrase or the exact pinpoint essence, but like kind of the broader

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:03.140
 stroke more bird's eye view meaning. And then thirdly, the hidden meaning. This is now it

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.660
 gets again into these different levels or layers of more and more subtle meaning that

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:14.840
 come, they correspond to more and more subtle views. When we refine our views, then certain

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:21.580
 levels of meaning open up to us and we start seeing them as well. And there's many ways

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:27.180
 there's in the Tantras, there's six levels, six yanas of Tantras. Each of them goes into

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.500
 a more hidden meaning. And then fourthly, the ultimate meaning. And Rinpoche said this

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:46.540
 is like the Dzogchen or Mahamudra, these highest, kind of highest unexcelled Tantras, like peak,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.700
 the highest view of the ultimate nature. So this is more related to wisdom awareness.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.400
 So each pit instruction can be understood in these four ways. And then in Rinpoche's books

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.920
 is two Tara books, the way they kind of explicitly talking about the four codes is more like

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:09.080
 the word meaning is like specifically to the text, according to the outer Tantra view,

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.100
 the word meaning. And then the general meaning they're saying is more according to Mahayoga

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:19.420
 understanding of visualization practice. And then the third, the hidden meaning is the

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:27.500
 Anayoga approach of completion stage with characteristics or by holding on to certain

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:36.260
 forms. And then fourthly, the ultimate meaning is the Dzogchen completion without characteristics,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:44.500
 not relying on anything provisional, just complete awakened awareness. These are four

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:51.180
 codes, four ways that we can just like a basic frame we can use to open deeper and deeper

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:58.220
 levels of a teaching in our experience. So it's like another tool we can have to kind

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:07.600
 of unlock some of the meaning in our experience of the Tantras to illuminate a little bit.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:13.340
 And then the six limits, going to that, this is also covered in His Holiness's book and

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.180
 many of Rinpoche's Shadr books too. And then they're similar to kind of what we've been

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:26.140
 discussing so far. There's three sets of kind of opposites in a way. The first two limits

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:33.800
 are the provisional and definitive meanings. So we've kind of briefly discussed those.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:39.620
 So in the Tantra, what's a provisional meaning? What's a definitive meaning? And then the

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:47.260
 next two are the intended meaning and the unintended meaning. So this is kind of like

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.060
 a little bit more like what was the, you could say the basic intention of offering the teaching

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:58.780
 or giving the teaching. And then what is the unintended or the not as easily recognizable

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:08.180
 intention of the Buddha saying something or of a Tantra being written in a certain way.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:15.920
 What's a little easier is like a parent with a child. They might give a reason that a child

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.420
 shouldn't do something. And it's not so much for the reason, but it's for another reason.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.700
 They're trying to help the child. The child can't understand and you know that you can't

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:32.460
 just only eat ice cream, you know. So they give some other reason. Like if you eat too

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:38.500
 much ice cream, you'll just turn into a big vat of ice cream. There's all different ways

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.120
 where the Buddha could teach one thing like recite a mani mantra once and you'll purify

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:51.180
 all these countless eons, so many eons of negative karma. Then what there's different

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.100
 levels kind of we kind of locate that. It's a provisional teaching or definitive and it's

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.740
 provisional. Is it true in what way at what level? So this is kind of what this is helping

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:07.180
 us unpack a little bit. We have to ask ourselves these questions. And then the third set is

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:14.560
 again we've discussed before the third set of the six limits is literal and non-literal.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:20.180
 The literal and non-literal meanings. So we have the provisional and definitive, the intended

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:28.420
 and unintended, and the literal and the non-literal. So this is all to say that the tantras are

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:35.340
 very sophisticated system and Buddhism in general with the four alliances. If we just

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:41.220
 think that the Buddha is just giving some blind faith belief, you know, this is so thoroughly

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.780
 refuted by the Buddha's actual teachings. We look at these four alliances, four codes,

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:51.560
 six limits. We can clearly see in the Buddha's own words and all that have been just repeated

00:28:51.560 --> 00:29:02.020
 so much for centuries by these masters. This is not the way Buddhism works. Which is a

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:10.740
 big point. Even unpacking these four codes and six limits, there's different ways to

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:22.740
 do it. It's a provisional teaching too. Buddha is such a genius. Okay, so in the Guyagarbha

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.860
 Tantra, which Rinpoche is teaching in their Outer Tantra book, they unpack the six limits

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.580
 in totally different way and they say this is one of the other really renowned ways of

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:38.100
 understanding the six limits. Here I'm just looking at notes, you know. Say in the Guyagarbha

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:44.380
 Tantra, the first limit is the view, the union of relative and absolute truths. We have to

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:53.620
 have that view. That's the first. And here the Rinpoche say that the word limit, it's

00:29:53.620 --> 00:30:02.580
 not, it's ta, t-h-a, it's not translated as limit, it's translated as foundation or necessity

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:09.580
 or base. What are the six foundations? First foundation is the unmistaken view of the union

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:16.460
 of relative and absolute truth. That's a one foundation. We have to have to correctly understand

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:23.460
 the Tantras. This is a different way to unpack the six limits. The second one is conduct.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:30.220
 We have to apply conduct, behavior that opens or like really emphasizes or makes even more

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:37.860
 brilliant that same view. Our conduct has to illuminate our view and expand it. Then

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:46.900
 thirdly we follow Samayas and commitments properly. That's the third limit, the third

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:53.780
 foundation or necessity. The fourth is we have to go step by step receiving the appropriate

00:30:53.780 --> 00:31:01.820
 empowerments in the right sequence and unlocking the meaning of the teaching thoroughly, step

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:10.940
 by step in order to properly understand and experience the Tantras. And fifth, concentration

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:17.500
 are our samadhi. Basically this Rimbaches are saying all of this process has to be facilitated

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.900
 through our meditation practice. We can't access these deeper meanings just on an intellectual

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:29.820
 level alone. We have to perform it. We have to transform our way of understanding. We

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.420
 have to refine our awareness and that happens through meditation, not just study alone or

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:41.060
 contemplation. We have to put it into practice. That's the only way these deeper meanings are

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:47.660
 going to unlock in our experience in a reliable steady way where they can be really changed

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:56.060
 the way we are and not just be some flash experience we had once and then it's gone.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:03.500
 And then the sixth limit is it has to follow the lineage pit instructions to correctly

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.180
 understand and absorb to access the meaning of the Tantras. It has to be authentic lineage

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:16.500
 and it has to go through authentic lineage pit instructions. These are the six foundations

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:29.780
 to correctly understand the Tantras. View, conduct, follow the Samayas, proceed gradually

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:38.740
 step by step in our experience to open up the awakening with meditation according to

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:44.460
 the lineage pit instructions. It's the only correct way to understand the Tantras taught

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:53.500
 by the Buddha. Then there's even a third way to understand the six limits. Here I'm throwing

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.980
 something out just to appreciate the beauty of the Buddha's teachings. This can all be

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.660
 applied to the nundra, how we understand our nundra practice. The third way to understand

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.940
 the six limits, which Kambhara Rinpoche says, is another very renowned way of understanding

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:16.180
 them and they cover it extensively in the outer Tantras, their outer Tantra Shirdarpok.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:21.020
 The first is like the first thing we have to rely on of the six limits. The first one

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:34.800
 is instruction manuals, actual guide books, Tantric guide books by qualified teachers.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.580
 So then how do we learn the instruction manual? We have to follow a qualified guru. That's

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:48.760
 the second limit. Then how does a lama become qualified? They have to have the pit instructions.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:56.700
 Not just the intellectual idea of them, and then not just a hunch. They have to be upholding

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:03.940
 and preserving those instructions received in a living lineage. Then fourthly, to some

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.660
 degree, they have to have actualized or directly experienced the meaning of the pit instructions

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:17.940
 in their own experience through their own practice. This is a foundation to understand

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:26.020
 the Tantras. Then fifthly, that realization, that guide that we're relying on, that realization

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:32.820
 has to come through practice. It has to be practiced in order for the realization to

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:45.060
 happen. The transformation can't be just thought about. It has to be undergone. And then finally,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:53.980
 the result, or it comes down to like the result of enlightenment, that they received these

00:34:53.980 --> 00:35:03.340
 pit instructions themselves from their qualified teacher in an uncorrupted, authentic lineage

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:09.000
 that's preserved the pit instructions in these instruction manuals, and they put it into

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.700
 practice themselves, and got some degree of realization, and they kept practicing it.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.060
 And then they became reliable guides for other people, for other beings like myself, just

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:26.140
 sentient beings, to actually learn to access the meaning of something as so vastly profound

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:31.980
 and complex and beautiful and simple as a dudrum terra sarnundra. These great masters

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.940
 have done all that work. And we have ways of making sense of why we should rely on a

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:47.180
 teacher. When the four reliances, the outer level of the teachings, the Buddha said, don't

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:56.460
 rely on the teacher, rely on the teaching. And as we keep applying that and testing for

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.100
 ourselves, and we get into more and more subtle territory, and our mind gets more and more

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:07.900
 refined, and the extent of cause and effect becomes more and more on our radar, the fast

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.900
 mystery of cause and effect.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:20.060
 As the deeper we get, the more we need a teacher, the more we need a guide, and the more capable

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:29.900
 we are of discerning the guidance, and really correctly locating the guidance, and asking

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:39.460
 for help when we need help. So here the teachings say, really begin with being very skeptical.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:51.900
 Look for yourself. Use logic. Use inference. Look at the scriptures. Look at what all these

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:59.380
 masters have said. And as our practice deepens and our kind of intellectual intelligence

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:07.740
 gets more kind of clarified, we have to go beyond logic. We have to go beyond kind of

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:13.500
 conceptual mind, especially if we get into things like tantra, where the first limit

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:22.180
 is to rely on a view, unmistaken view of the union of relative and absolute truth. And

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:29.700
 we need a teacher to receive these instructions, and we need to be able to discern teachers,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.260
 and we need to be able to discern our own qualities as a student. And we have to be

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:42.100
 humble, honest with ourselves about that, and willing to receive feedback. And that's

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:49.560
 a very involved process, so we need to really bring the A game. We need to bring everything

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.670
 that we can from our own side, and be receptive, and curious, and keep learning, but also

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.200
 courageous,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.780
 and have really healthy kind of abilities to distinguish and define. And it comes down

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.700
 to it every time we have to actually apply them to our own minds, our own hearts. We

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.340
 have to live it. The Dharma has to be lived. That's why if we look at how these kind of

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:18.020
 like four alliances unfold, the four codes, the six limits, we can see how people can

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.660
 understand, oh, Buddhism is a religion. Then it goes deeper and becomes a philosophy. Then

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.500
 it goes deeper and it becomes a way of life. Then it goes deeper and it becomes an uninterrupted

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:36.360
 living experience of how wisdom beings, like how sage-like beings experience all of reality

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.020
 from moment to moment, and all the different ways that it can be experienced, the vast

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:47.020
 spectrum of cause and effect, and the vast spectrum of views that beings can take. This

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:53.780
 is all Buddhism. And so I wanted to just take a little time, not to just throw out a lot

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:59.740
 of different numerical systems, but to just also honor, to pause and in a way honor, like

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.140
 the richness of the Buddhist teachings. And not just the richness, but the Buddha gave

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:12.340
 us these methods, these codes, these keys to unlock the meaning more deeply in ourselves

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:19.340
 and our experience. The Buddha gave us all these systems of inquiry, but we have to apply

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:29.020
 them ourselves. And it's such a wonderful opportunity we have. It's such a wonderful

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:35.260
 opportunity that I come across things like this and teachings by Kemba Ramache's and

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:43.580
 the Buddha, and just so much nuance. It's just been there all along and it's been preserved.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:50.740
 If we get tired of the same old, same old, back and forth, black and white, kind of like

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:57.760
 brutal wrestling that's been kind of, you know, somehow become like a norm, the norm

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.500
 of like how people are supposed to be, then we can look to things like Buddhism, how such

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:12.060
 a rich, rich living tradition that goes so much deeper than just saw this either/or kind

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:19.320
 of thinking. And it really asks us to like bring our full Buddha nature out from hiding,

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.420
 you know, and to reveal it for our own benefit and the benefit of others, both now and long

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:33.300
 into the future. I'm so just utterly amazed every time by the Buddha's teachings. They

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:42.380
 just go so deep and it's so open and then it leads to just such naturalness. Not anything

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:48.780
 just overly complicated for its own sake, but it's just more helpful so we can kind

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:54.380
 of zoom in and be with each other, kind of tune into each other more skillfully and simply

00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:00.580
 and just write what's right. At that time, with someone we're with, then we can kind

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.980
 of zoom out and flexibly engage our experience as it keeps changing in a different way that's

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:11.500
 really context sensitive and really helpful. So I hope some of this is helpful, at least

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.180
 is like little doorways to peek into these really deep, profound teachings. Of course,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.140
 there's so much more to say about these things and it would be, it's just a very extensive

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.660
 big topic. The tantras in general, of course, but then also just these methods of unlocking

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:34.580
 their utter brilliance. So thanks so much. Appreciate the time. Really? And then we'll

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:55.680
 go into the practice of the Dijim Terasarnandro. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.980
 Thank you all so much. I hope it was helpful just to have a little quick kind of turbo

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:08.460
 summary of topics that are super profound, four reliances, four codes, six limits, kind

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:14.580
 of what all these are orienting towards is that the teachings as we kind of keep working

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:20.140
 with them and keep kind of absorbing them and becoming receptive to the Dharma, that

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:27.780
 it deepens and we deepen. And our relationship to our guide, our guru and our community,

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:33.780
 it all deepens. And so this is really, hopefully it's like kind of a, there are kind of a few

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:42.020
 little kind of ways of seeing that depth and that beauty in the teachings and ourselves

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.540
 and our kind of amongst our qualified teachers can see how just a quick survey of these six

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:53.140
 limits is like three different ways of seeing how the teachings go deeper and then how our

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:59.180
 self, our experience of our view and our practice and conduct, it all goes deeper and how like

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.980
 our relationship with a qualified Lama as the six foundations, that deepens and what's

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:10.380
 required to actually be in that position to hold that kind of wisdom and transmit it.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:17.020
 That yeah, so hopefully this is kind of a little encouraging of like when the richness

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:23.100
 of the Dharma is so vast and profound, there's a next opening, there's a next step in the

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.820
 Buddha taught this sequence of steps, not in some kind of rigid kind of like heavy handed

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:35.180
 way, but just as a natural unfolding, that things become naturally more compassionate

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:40.460
 naturally more wise as we keep applying the teachings in our lives. So I hope that was

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.820
 clear and just a brief little time I took to go over that. So I really genuinely hope

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.700
 that was helpful.
