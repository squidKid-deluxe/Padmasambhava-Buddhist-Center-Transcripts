NOTE     "synopsis": "Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 11\nMay 8, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 Visualization, of course, again, when we realize the foundation of the visualization is always in

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.840
 the teaching set the confidence. Confidence, when we realize something, when we meditate,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.560
 we're not going to linger. I'm not exactly, but I'm going to try. That statement, maybe it's quite

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.840
 modest state, nice, but that statement is we are manipulated by the ego clinging. That statement

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 maybe is in the externally way, maybe is modest state, more humble that, but when we come to the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.280
 meditation practice, we have to have courage, confidence, and in teaching also mentioned,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.070
 you know that, you have a very bright, very bright. We are not relying on the world of duality and

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.400
 ego

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.080
 clinging. We are back to our origin status. What that origin state is, is Buddha nature,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.920
 Dathangata garba, three kaya status. Three kaya state is our basic nature.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.520
 Nature of the mind is already awakened, already enlightened. So now that nature of the mind is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.800
 a period of form of or transformed as a gift of singing about all the visualizations.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.120
 That visualization meditating is a technique, but actually we are coming back or returning back to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.080
 our origin status where we really belongs, belongs to uphold that with confidence,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.200
 with the devotions, with excitement, with enthusiasm, with the determinations.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:03.120
 Don't let interfere by the doubt, hesitations, and skeptical thoughts. Then we are undermining

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.400
 the quality of the practice in meditation. So therefore, keep up that. That well,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 if we keep up that, that nature, then truly we become. We are in that status.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 See this. So therefore, Vidyalaya in here said, merge one's own Samaya Sattva and the Vasiram Satt

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.840
va.
