NOTE     "synopsis": "Vajrayana Master & Nyingma Scholar\nVenerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\n\u201cEssential Dzogchen Teachings on the View, Meditation, and Conduct\u201d\nby the Great Master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\nPBC Palden Sherab Pema Ling Retreat Center:\nLotus Land of Glorious Wisdom\n18190 131st Trail N\nJupiter, FL  33478\n\nEmpowerment of Guru Padmasambhava as Guru Vidyadhara \nRevealed by the Great Terton Tsasum Lingpa\n(Sunday Morning, January 15 - In Person Only at Pema Ling in Jupiter, Florida)\n\nGuru Padmasambhava gave a variety of teachings to benefit future generations. Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 I want to show you a very slightly different way of explaining this Dzogchen. I thought it was just

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 a wonderful explanation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Really? I thought that's enough. Really?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Dzogchen is, of course, a breath-wave. In Tibetan, it's known as Dzogwa Cimbu. Dzogwa Cimbu.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 So Dzog, Pa, and Cimbu. There are three kind of works. What means Dzog? Dzog is the great master.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Of course, this is every year. All the teachings say that. That means everything is completed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Everything is completed. What is everything?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 All the samsara is completed within this. All the nirvana is complete within this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And all the path, journey from the samsara to nirvana is complete.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.060
 How is that completed? It's not something that is completed in a big container and put everything

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.000
 in a package of sauce.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Oh, kind of like all the toy bags. T-O-I, toy bags. These are children, big children, toy bags.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And put everything in a container. No. Not like that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 What that container is is dhamma-dhatu, pervasive, dhamma-dhatu, openness, beyond the limitation

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and boundaries, pervasive.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 That pervasive nature, everything is completed. How is it completed?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.130
 All that's completed, those objects, what everything is, samsara objects and nirvana objects,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.000
 application, path objects, are all inseparably completed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 The nature and each of the samsara, nirvana, path, that never separated from that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It's inseparable state. That's how it's all complete. Everything in that state.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.140
 So everything, items that you see, we think, we perceive or hear, is never separated from that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.000
 great nature, pervasive nature, uncombounded nature.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 It's really pervasive, pervasive, that nature.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So that is what's called completion. Completion or completion. So, in individual, so.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Then pamis, pamis, who is perceiving that, or where that all is completed?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 That nature is not outside as object, or object, sorry, it's not outside, it's object.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 It's within this, our own rupa, your rupa.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Our rupa is the perceiving that qualities and all that completed within our rupa.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Pa, zupa cemu, pa is rupa, you see. Everything is within the rupa, our own state.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 Even though it looks so gigantic and so big in the water, but yet it is all complete within the rup

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.000
a and beholden by rupa and is emanated from the rupa.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.840
 It's a culturally union state. That's what in the teaching said in the Tibetan world, the union of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.000
 the wisdom and the spaces,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 or union of the wisdom, or primordial wisdom, and dhamma dhatus, a totally union.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Rupa is a union of the wisdom, primordial wisdom, and the vastness and openness, natures, rupas.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And what is that also? In the Dokti teaching, that is known as the three kaya states.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Often said three kaya, the embodiment of three kaya, rupa, our own rupa.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Rupa is a Tibetan world and translated into any as awareness.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 The pure awareness is the embodiment of the three kayas.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 What are three kayas? Dhamma kaya, Sambokaya, and Nirmakaya.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.350
 The emptiness aspect of the rupa is dhamma kaya. The clarity, the weakness aspect of the rupa is

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.000
 sambokaya.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And pervasive energy, radiating energy aspect of the rupa is Nirmakaya.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Yet that all seems that they are not three different things.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 With this three kaya, that energy, that power is reflected externally according to Dokti teaching.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Then we see poem, song, space. It's all external. It's all reflection.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And what is the teaching here? All in the three kaya states is the rupa states.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 The display of rupa, three kaya, is external. These are all qualities.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Poem, song, and space. Reality is display of our own rupa.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.760
 According to Dokti teaching, according generally in the Buddha teaching, not just from the Mahayana

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.000
 teaching, clearly explained by the gracious kindness, wise teaching of the Buddha,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 explained orally, so and so. And then this basic Dokti teaching has so many different names too.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Dokti, for example, in the Mahayana service, obtained this name as dathanga dandagas.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Dathanga dandagas, which translated into English, can be Buddha-natural.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Buddha-natural, dathanga dandagas.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Then in the dandagas, for example, in the human schools, dandagas in the Dokti level,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Dokti level in the mind-only certain teachings, kind of more emphasizing this, this, to the planet,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 this, this nature.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.760
 As bodhijas, absolute bodhijas, bodhijas, just bodhijas, that's what we call the king of creation,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.000
 bodhijas.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 The people's dandagas, king of creation, bodhijas.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.040
 And in the mind section of the Dokti teaching, the space of the phenomena, the empty of the

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.000
 phenomena.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 In the Dokti teaching, many times they referred terminology used, sub-born customs.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:22.840
 Many also had other teachings, teachings about all in the mind, all in the unobscured, uncontracted

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.000
, all in the mind.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Those are the terminology used in the different levels of the Dokti teachings.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 But referring the same thing. And this, generally this teaching, this, generally this Buddha nature

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 teaching is a very pure teaching.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 A great community, I told, let me have a history of that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Then we study also, kind of like the activity or understanding of this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So I told that.
