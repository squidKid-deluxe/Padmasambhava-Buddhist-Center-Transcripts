00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
 Thank you everyone again. Thank you so much everyone again for the participation. Thank you. Thank

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.000
 you very much. Thank you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 And again I'd like to say welcome everyone. Very welcome. And again we continue teaching where we

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.000
 started two years ago.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.240
 And this is the third year we're going to talk continuity of great teaching which is revealed by

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.000
 the very famous Niyung Mathethung.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.880
 Niyung Mathethung, who came in the 19th century. And his revelation of teachings is called "Shire

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.000
 Dorje Nombu" in Arabic.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And in the English we translated "Shout Vajra Awareness" teaching. So we continue following that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.130
 Again to do teaching, always in the teaching mentioned as I think whenever you already know that to

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.000
 re-stand in our motivation.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.650
 Motivation is so so important in the foundation. Everything. Motivation means mind. So we correct

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.000
 the mind. Why do we need to correct the mind?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.230
 We have so many different conceptions, but the link to in our head and mind all the time that. And

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.000
 most of the time is a regular samsaric mind.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.820
 That means duality mind, habajapateness, some of the connected with the emotions that. So those are

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.000
 called samsara mind.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.670
 And with the greatest teacher Buddha often mentioned at the very beginning of time, cause of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 suffering truth and suffering truth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.800
 To truth, cause to truth. These negative emotions are the cause of suffering truth. It's very cause

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.000
.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.190
 Negative emotion is really the fundamental cause of samsara. When we have the negative emotion, we

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 are keeping the will of samsara.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 Samsara is moving. Samsara is well maintained by these negative emotions. But when we practice dh

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.000
arma, when we reflect dharma, we are trying to reverse that habajapateness.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.700
 This habajapateness is so long time with us. According to Buddha's teaching, from the beginningless

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.000
 times until now, there's no numbers.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And we have to reverse that. That's called practice. That's called following the path. Path truth.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And then bring the cessation truth or the realization, the enlightenment truth will bring.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 So therefore, this correct motivation is really so important. This time correct motivation in the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 teaching said truth motivations.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.310
 Generally Buddhism is the motivation and the vedayana motivation. Those are named vastness

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.000
 motivation of the bodhicata.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.370
 And then skilpa means motivation of the vedayana teaching. Combine together. Also not two separate

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.000
 things. Combine together.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.350
 Skilpa means the motivation of vedayana. Vedayana is based on the vastness motivation of the bodhic

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.000
ata.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.820
 They are combined. They are the same. But however, vastness motivation of the bodhicata is that we

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.000
 all heard so many times.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 You know, I know we heard from the teaching, we read the books, books, and the bodhicata.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.180
 It's kind of a comparison thought for all living beings, comparison thought without too many self-

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.000
important thoughts.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 One of the mostly powerful obstacles for the bodhicata is self-important.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And the self-important motivation is the most powerful cause of the samsara.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.290
 The samsara that we keep in the samsara is self-important. And self-important we kind of extend a

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.000
 little bit to what we call ego clinging.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Ego. Ego is self-important. That is not something that we think, "Oh, I'm so important."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 But naturally there is self-important. We have the attitude of self-important and important of ours

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.000
.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Self and ours. And others less important. Others and all that goes.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.440
 So that is really the in the teaching said the most obstacles or the cause to obstacles for the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 enlightenment of bodhicata and cause to maintain us in samsara.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 So at this time we go to the teaching of the Vedic teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.150
 particularly Mahayana teaching the vastness motivation of the bodhicata, really thinking of all

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.000
 living beings.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Everyone has the same intentions, the same thought, the same more interesting, which means everyone

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 likes to be happy in joy and peace.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.470
 And everyone don't like really get suffering and sad and there's trouble with misfortunes. We're

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.000
 saying motivation.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 So yet we are not getting that. Exactly. We're not fulfilling. We're always struggling.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.500
 And therefore really we should, from the goal of our heart and mind, today I'm going to reflect the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.030
 particularly Mahayana teaching, made that benefit for all living beings from now until they reach

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.000
 the enlightenment.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Kind of reaching, sensitive from the heart and the mind of that vastness motivation.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And then combined with those poor, immeasurable, poor, they can think of those all so wonderful.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.030
 Even one moment of the thinking of the immeasurable, those are the stretches, may all living beings

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.000
 have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Sensitive thinking, one moment in the heart and the mind in the teaching said, it's so much power.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Also not just teaching said that, but many people experience it.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 When you have the genuine loving kind of the compassion in your heart, it is really powerful.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Healing, it will heal the emotions. It removes the suffering.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 It will heal the old diseases, sicknesses.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 It prevents negative obstacles, handiness.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And in the teaching it will also have great protections.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.370
 All the immeasurable beings, divine, the gods will protect us when you have the love and compassion

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.000
 truly in the heart.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 That individually is the jewel light of the world.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 All in the area, that is the universal righteousness to everyone, to one.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.070
 Because when they see, be the gods and dharma palace, when they see, really in the teaching they

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.000
 protect.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.610
 There's many stories that when you have the true love and the true compassion in the heart and the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.000
 mind,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.480
 there are even the many wild animals that avoided them when they see that wild animals are coming

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.000
 toward you,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 to you sometimes. And when we have the genuine love and the compassion in the heart and the mind,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 it's really in the teaching that is prevented.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 There's many, many stories like that. So it's so powerful.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And it's all good with this bodhijatam, told.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And then in the Vedayana teaching often mentioned, then seeing everything as perfect mandalas.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Little mandala, mandala of the three kayas.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 All the forms are the display of the nirmakaya mandalas.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 All the sound systems are the mandala of the sambhukayas.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And the mind and the space are the mandala of the dharma kayas.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Reality really does all three are targeted.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It's not something three different objects in three different locations.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Within the dharma kayas, three other kayas are completed.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Within the nirmakaya, two other kayas are completed.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.820
 What means, I'm talking that, for example, within the nirmakaya state, there is sambhukaya

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.000
 qualities.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 There is dharma kayas qualities. Within the sambhukaya, there is also nirmakaya and dharma kayas.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 So it's completely combined and targeted there.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And then in the teaching also, we explained a little bit that

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 all five aggregators are the five dhyana-buddhas, male-buddhas.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Five elements are five pimal-buddhas.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 All the limbs of the prasikana, different emanations of the bodhisattvas,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 those are in the teaching mentioned.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 It's not just the teaching mentioned.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 We don't see that right now because due to the cataracts of the duality mind,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 we don't see that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 But reality really is everything in that status.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That's why naturally this universe in the world is the mandala of the deities.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Pure land, that means it's pure land.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 That means this universe is pure land.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 When you have the realization, this is not something that pure land have to go far away.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Pure land, we have to be removed.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Our duality, this negative obscuration when we are removed,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 our duality removed, pure land is right here according to the technique

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 because all five aggregators are the five dhyana-buddhas, male-buddhas.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Five elements are the pimal-buddhas.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Reality, they are also in the union.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 That's what is involved in teaching so many unions.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 This is not just the union of the emotions.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 This is the union of the divine mandala, naturally as it is.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 The union and totally great blessfulness.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 That means no tendence of sufferings.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Suffering the sadness is caused by the dualities.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 When duality is preached, everything is transformed.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Everything is really in the, according to the teaching or those who regard realization,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 is totally blessfulness.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Perfectly blessfulness.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Beautifully.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 That is in status.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Status.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 So, in the way we are teaching, we can both each other thought, activating those.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 We try to, because we like, that is our goal, to discover our inner nature of the enlightenment.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So we can't really both each other thought and discover, have those beautiful motivations.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Those are known as vastness motivation of the bodhicitta.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Those are the skillful means of motivation of the Vedayana teaching.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So vastness motivation of the bodhicitta, what that vastness means.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Because sentient beings, living beings are vastness.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 There is no numbers.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And to reach to all living beings, our bodhicitta has no boundaries.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 It's vastness.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Therefore vastness motivation of the bodhicitta, vastness.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 When we had vastness motivation of bodhicitta to vastness all the sentient beings,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 what it has in the teaching is that it has vastness benefits, powerful benefits.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 It purifies obscurations, negativities.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.810
 Those obscurations, when many times the teaching means emotion obscurations, knowledge obscurations

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.000
,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 those are really removed.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Cleared purify, gradually according our degree of the bodhicitta and understanding.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And at the same time, what is happening, not just the cleansing purify,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 but we are discover in the inner college our treasure of the mind.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 A treasure of the mind, of wisdom, chaos, joy, happiness, peace, courage, commitment.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Those are all shining so beautifully.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Those are known as, also, meaning the marriages, to marriages that we heard so many times.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So this is what really is all.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So those, therefore, this motivation is so important.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 And for those reasons in the teaching, what the gracious teacher Buddha said,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 every time when he gives the teaching, you listen, listen perfectly, lokanyuna,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 and listen perfectly, and keep that in the mind, then I will give you the teaching.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 That's it.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Listen carefully, in a little bit, lokanyuna, ila, sondhe, ne chula, sheto.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 That's the in a little bit about I'm roughly an athlete.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Listen perfectly and keep in the heart and the mind.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 What that actually means, I said,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 with those beautiful motivation, don't listen, reflect teaching with emotions,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 with joy and appreciation.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Joy and appreciation and respect.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 And then also keep that in the heart.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Not just let it come from one ear, right ear, and go through the left ear.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Left ear, go away.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Passing through, no.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Hold that to the heart.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Then what gracious teacher said, then I will teach you.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 That is almost, you read, if the 84,000 teachings now translated at the very beginning time,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 almost everyone has that.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 That, lokanyuna, ila, sondhe, ne chula, sheto.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Those are also mentioned in what's called words, my perfect teacher translated.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Those are translated.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 There is errors of the three mistakes when you are listening.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Awarded three mistakes, awarded that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And then also, three errors of the whistles, double, not W.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 We, maybe I just translated the whistle instead.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Three errors of the ports, P-O-T, ports.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 And then six stains.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Six stains.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Awarded those.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 You can, since now this book is translated and you look those.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 That is what gracious teacher, Buddha, mentioned.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Listen carefully, that's the condensate.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Listen carefully and keep that in the heart and I will teach you.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 So those are the related teaching mentioned.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 So those are.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 And now we do the beautiful motivation.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Now we go to the text itself.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Many of you already have that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 And this text has like eight sections, eight different chapters.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Some are a little longer and some are shorter.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And the text we translated, I mean, is a bit of target help to translate this.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 From the next of the pure appearance and the pre-module of wisdom,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 the pre-module of experience of the summoned body,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 the spontaneous accompanied schedule of the dukkim,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 the sharp weather of the awareness of the contents of the great sacred mantrayanas.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 It's a new book, so not everybody knows.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 You don't have any?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Not everybody knows.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Okay.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So if you don't, I think we have available in the technological levels

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 and get that if you don't have that.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And I'm going to follow pretty much trying to follow with these texts.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Look, this is translated, looking at these texts

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 and then go through this as much as I can.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 That's what I did before and this is my plan.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 So every you can get that through technology level, please get that.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And then also, we have the ability to do it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 You want that, of course, you can get that.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 This was for technology or the e-book, no?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 E-book.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 E-books.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 You can get e-books through that, which is then that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 But either way, okay.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 So we look, but this text has, like, about the ad that you see,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 ad sections, ad different sections.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And we went through third one.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Last few years, we went through until third section.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 The first one is in the title or the concluding section in the teaching said,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 is explaining about the taking mind as part.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Taking mind as part.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Second is establishing or the beholdering the Vipassana inside.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And the third one is establishing the Dharmakaya foundations.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Those are the concluding ending of the text.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Each time in this teaching mentioned, you see them.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 If you have booked that, three things.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 So firstly, if I use that best and use it as a simple way to explain more

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 about mind and about the shamatha meditation.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Of course, it has, I'm saying it's not all.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Because this Dokkien teaching is really best on every time.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 It's all going to the nature of the mind and to the point.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Mind is mostly important to everything in Buddhism.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Because mind is the jewel of everything.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Even though we don't detect the mind, even though we don't see the mind,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 we all have the mind.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Mind is direct as every hour movement of the physically, verbally.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And then, of course, mind itself.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 So that means if I talk at a larger level, mind is training,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 mind is leading and leading our old samsara activities.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Samsara is, mind is keeping, mind is directing to ourselves.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And all our nirvana process, or the enlightenment process,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 is directing and maintaining, activating by our mind.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Therefore, mind is drooling everything.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 In Dokkien teaching, mind second teaching,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 used in the metaphor, king of all creation, or king of creation.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Mind is a king, creating everything.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 That's the Buddhist philosophy, Buddha's teaching.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Buddha's teaching, everything, our, so that means in a small level,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 joy, for example, in the contemporary level,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 our joy is created by the mind.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Our happiness is created by the mind.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Our sadness is created by the mind.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Our melancholy is created by the mind.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Mind is everything.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Even though maybe we see somebody calls me to death,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 but that's in Buddhism, conditions, the very cause is our mind.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Conditions, without a cause, condition alone cannot produce, produce.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 That we know, we know in the logic level,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 or in the simple farmers' technology or skills,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 just cause alone can produce, need conditions.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Conditions alone cannot do, need cause.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Fundamental cause is the mind.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 For that reason, gracious teacher of Buddha said,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 "Simple, why the teaching?"

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 "Tame your mind."

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 This is my teaching of Buddha teaching.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 "Tame your mind."

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Who will tame your mind?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Nobody else will tame our mind.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Be practical, not carried by with the force of the kind of rumor

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 or something, or somebody will do that.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 No.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 We have truth.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Each individual has 100% capabilities to tame our own mind.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 For that, even Buddhists cannot tame our mind.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 For that reason, gracious teacher of Buddha said,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 "I showed you the path.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Now is your turn."

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 To put that or not.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Buddha is a great teacher.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Teacher.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Teacher shows the teachings, how to do,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 but we have to apply.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 So mind is everything.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And for that, in the beginning time,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 in his post this section of teaching,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 he is explaining a little more, emphasizing of the mind

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 and samatha meditation.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 We connect meditation with the mind.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Samatha meditation, which is so important.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 But at the same time, this is zokki teaching.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 I like the zokki teaching.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 It has all zokki teachings as well as all the other teachings.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 That inattentor means other teachings,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 inattentor such as mahayoga teaching,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 anayoga teaching, atayoga teaching.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Teaching. True. True.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And then the second one,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 explained here in the concluding section,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 it said highlight, is then the rebhayana explained.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Rebhayana is then the zokki actually.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Rebhayana means seeing the nature of the mind.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 See the nature as it is.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 What nature of the mind is, then,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 is in a simple way to tell, is emptiness.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 There is nothing to hold anything.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 We must get analyzed, even though we all have the mind.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 But every, I ask to myself, where is my mind?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 What answer we have?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 What do we find?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Even you are looking.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Look into that.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 That's what in the greatest teacher,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Buddha Shakyamana is teaching, all those all great masters,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 emptiness.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 There is nothing to really explain, to comment.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 That openness, that vastness.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 This.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And yet it contains all the qualities,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 all the qualities, what that means, the qualities.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 All the good side of the,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 nirvana call it, enlightenment call it,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 this emptiness mind.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 All the samsara call it, all is with mind.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Again, I'm trying to precisely let you more clear that.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 You all know that.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 But I've said, what is samsara call it?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Angay is with mind.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Attachment is with mind.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And jealousy is with mind.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Ignorant is with mind.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Arrogant is with mind.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 It's not anywhere else.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 It's with mind, with mind.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Where that is, it shall again.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Don't find.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 Can't say anything.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Not just only the all nirvana call it,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 joy, peace, devotion, bodhicata,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 courage, commitment, joy of effort.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 And call it with six paramatas.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 All that is with mind.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Is truth true?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's not just stories.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 It's not just myth.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Really.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 This is what's true.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 True.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 So therefore, seeing this,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 seeing the nature of the mind,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 seeing the reality past, F-A-C-E,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 past of the mind is insight.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 In it a bit, long tone.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 And we all we pass on.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 You've seen the past of nature.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Past of the nature of the mind,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 or past of the mind,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 reality past of mind.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Listen to me.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 When we don't even think of that mind,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 about that, we presume we have mind.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Someone inside, somewhere in the brain,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 or heart, or wherever, something.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 But if we're trying to really look,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 investigate, shout, wager,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 ever not, investigate that.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Trying to find out.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 There's no space.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 No sport.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Any sport that you can see.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 So see nature exactly as it is.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 We pass on.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 That.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Seeing the emptiness, openness of that.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 And that is the second,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 second kind of highlight teaching

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 as I'm following with the gracious teacher,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 teacher Dunyul-Lunga himself in his teaching,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 highlight that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Highlight that.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 And third one is discovering a third section,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 or third chapter of use.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Use a third section that is

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 discovering the Dharmakaya.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Dharmakaya nature.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 So now, what is the difference

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 between Vipassana and Dharmakayas?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Basically, they really the same Dharmakaya.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 But Dharmakaya, when we're explaining,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 it has qualities.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Vipassana means emptiness.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Discover the emptiness.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 That's empty.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 But Dharmakaya, when you talk,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 it has, call it with emptiness.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 It has vitality with that emptiness.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 And it has all the potentials with that emptiness.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 All the potentials.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 What are vitality?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 What are the potentials?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 I'm using those terminologies

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 because that emptiness of the highest,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 all the qualities, as I said,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 samsara qualities, nirvana qualities,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 really to activate it.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 All the qualities, if I use another word,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 all the richness of samsara and samsara mind,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 and all the richness of the quality of the nirvana,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 all is in the mind.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 When we discover that qualities,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 then it's Dharmakaya.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 In the Buddha teaching, what did he say?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 I mean, Dharmakaya, nature has what?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Ten powers.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Fulfillness.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Fulfilllessness.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Fulfilllessness.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 And 18 extra ordinary qualities.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Eighteen extra ordinary qualities.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Those are the main, those are.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 All that within this emptiness mind,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 that is Dharmakaya.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Dharmakaya is the source of sambhokaya,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 source of nirmakaya, where that arises.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 So, if it's simple, if you would tell,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 all the sambhokaya qualities within the Dharmakaya

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 and all the nirmakaya qualities

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 and the richness are in the Dharmakaya.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Kaya. Kaya.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 So, exploring that qualities

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 is then the discovering Dharmakaya,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 that third section.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And again, of course, that highlight ending

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 by the new lung was there,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 but it also explain all the other techniques and things.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 When you look to that third section,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 we went through last year too, through those things,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 all the different techniques too.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 So, that is what we went through there.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And this year, now we begin the fourth one.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 The fourth one.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And here, the fourth one is what starts later here.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Here.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And on a certain,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 on extending the intrinsic characteristics

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 of the excellent qualities of the ground,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 excellent quality.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 This is, then in the teaching said,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 it is explaining about the Dharmakaya qualities,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Dharmakaya and all Dokkin, Dokkin teachings.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 So, now we're going to the Dokkin teachings.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And now, that begins with here,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 so now we go here, which is here.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 And this is, of course, you all know,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 the new lung farm who came, I think was born as 19, not 19.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 1835, I think, 1835,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 and entered the Mahabharata in Nirvana, 19 of home, I think.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 19 of home.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And he was one of the great thetums

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 in the 19th century, in the 19th century.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And one of the great thetums and the crazy western masters.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And Sabantenin understood all the teachings,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 teaching so many great regions

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 and able to see all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in light beings.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 And like Guru, Deva, and Dokkinis,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 and Dokkinis, really, just amazing, sparkly.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 And then his discovery teaching is also known as,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 generally in the Newmarch school.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 You all know, many of you already know,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 few of you maybe you don't know that.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 In the Newmarch school, generally, we talk a little bit about that,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 that as, in general, it is all Buddha teaching.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 This is the Buddha Shakyamuni Gauta Enlightenment, age 35,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and then that year, 49 days,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 after Buddha's Mahabharata, sorry, Enlightenment,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 and he started giving the teachings, one after another.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 Those are the three turning well of dharma.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Those are three turning well of dharma.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 First turning well of dharma,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 second turning well of dharma,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 and third turning well of dharma.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 And those are all known as, and put as teaching.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 And now, in the end of the day,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 it's oscillated in the 8th century,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 the time of the Gautapima Sambho,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 the great Kintaso, Disney, and the great master.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Shandaraki, at that time, so many great oscillators

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 eliminated, translated teaching,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 and those are known, that time started.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Most of it oscillated, there's over 100 volumes,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 most of that oscillated at that time.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Those are known as the Kanjals.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Kanjals.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 And the same time they translated,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 so many commentaries on those Buddha teachings

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 by such many great masters,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 masters such as Nagarjuna, Asenga, Vasubendu,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Narmakitti, I mean, all those great,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 and Shandaraki, the teaching,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 that is called the Kanjals, those days.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 So Kanjals and Kanjals.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And then in Nirma schools,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 it's very Buddhist, and in Tibetan days,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 the poor schools are very major poor schools,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 poor days, and many other schools too.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 But poor schools are the Nirma,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 and Gaju, Satya, and Agela, those schools.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 And the Nirma teachings are then continually preserved,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 that at the same time teaching what taught,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 taught in the Baidang Europe,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 and some of the great masters, Shandaraki,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and Bhagavamata, so forth,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 continually maintained, maintained those teachings,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 known as Kama teachings, or Nirma Kama teachings.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And then also there is called the Thelma teachings.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Thelma, that is the Thelma,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 that is hidden by the Gurba and Sambhava,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 assisted by the Vastra of Dakini, Shinshoja,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 as well as many other great, those masters,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 hidden, rediscovered, those are known as the Thelma teachings.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 If I translated that in the English,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 is the Kama in the Thelma.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Kama means order-class, lineage teachings,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 and the Thelma means hidden, rediscovered teachings.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 And why is it hidden in the teaching itself?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 In the Buddha's teaching too,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 and to award the missing the teaching

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 to protect the teaching,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 and then it's good to hide those teachings

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 on the rocks, the mountains, and the waters,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 or whatever it is, to prevent not loss of teaching,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 and at the same time, then they will reveal again.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And as the many teachings are hidden that way

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 and discovered by many great Thelma,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 those are known as thelma teachings.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Within thelma teachings,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 there is also another teaching called

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 pure Vigin lineage, pure Vigins, pure Vigins.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 And that is, again, in the teaching mentioned,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 and the Vigins are, for example,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 known as the Vigin teaching,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 as well as Mind Thelma teachings.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 And that is, in the teaching said,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 in the 8th century, Vibhama Sambharva,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 and the Shinshoja hidden those teachings,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 so entrusted that teaching in the heart of those

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 then highly relaxed beings, such as those 25 disciples,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 one of the 25 disciples in the heart and the mind,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 entrusted that.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 So that means, from the mind to mind of the Mihielini,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 and entrusted in the heart and the mind of those great beings.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And Gaurabha and Sambharva, and mentioned,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 or together with the Shinshoja,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 you will revere this teaching at such and such time

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 in the future when there is needed that.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 This was a different time era, you will revere,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 and then you will revere again that.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 And that is, for example, his only Dnununmi teaching.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Many are.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And Dnununmi language teaching.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And then, as well as Nnunmi language teaching,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 those are like the three Mind Thelma, many.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 And then there is pure Vigin Thelma teaching.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Those are highly enlightened beings, such as those,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 such as Dnununmi and Nnunmi language.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 I mean, all these great masters, they had pure Vigin,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 and such as also Namchim, Majordodgim.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Very famous in my Tethom.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 The Buddha appears right in front of them.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Them and give the teaching.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Teaching, and then they are transcribed there

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 on a certain time of practice by themselves,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and transcribed that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 So those are known as pure Vigin Thelma.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 And this teaching, Dnununmi language teaching,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 is pure Vigin teaching.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 But as well as also it is really from his worst mind.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 He transformed, he transformed himself

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 as like Vajradhara or the Buddha, some of the Buddha himself.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 In that state, he explored these teachings,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 teaching subcontainers, subcontainers.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 So it is, in a way, pure Vigin teaching

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 because it's mentioned.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 The illusion net of the wisdom,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 the wisdom illusion net of the pure Vigin.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 That's what he said.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 The way a paid teaching is not something pure Vigin,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 but subcontainers arise from his sharp weather awareness

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 or from his primordial wisdom.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Primordial wisdom is transformed

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 as the Buddha summoned the Buddha or the Vedas, Dara, Dara,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 along with the Sambhava,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 and then expound these teachings, teachings.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So that's how it is, how this teaching came.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 And now, in that teaching,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 and now today is the fourth one we go.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 That is the essential nature of all the apparent existence, emptiness.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Great emptiness is subcontainers actualized

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 as the essentials of the path.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 I have a little bit something.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 So this is what I said here.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 This, this has, in here a little bit,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 each has descriptions of the kind of, highlighted each description.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 I have this commentary by one of his disciples,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Pimatrashi, and his commentaries following that,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 which is, I think, translated into English, too.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 I think maybe whenever you have that.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 This is called post-identifying of the foundation,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 foundation, foundation, foundation.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Yeah, that's it.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Foundations, so this is the highlight, real explanation,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 of, highlight the post of the foundations,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 and then going to Gomu, details that.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 And now, that is, I read already,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 is essence of Dharmakai is, is Sungata.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 What is that?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 What is that?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Oh, no, no, here.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Here, here.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 So that is really explained.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Esenical nature, the brain exists in the emptiness.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Great emptiness, the spontaneous, actualized essence of the path,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 path, the spontaneous, so that is the kind of highlight

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 of the really, really pointing out about the ground, ground that.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And what it truly means, ground, ground, ground is the ground of the,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 ground and the source of samsara and nirvana.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Samsara has source, nirvana has source.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 And, you know, also in the teaching, many times you mentioned,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 kundi, lamsam in it a bit.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Kola means samsara, debah means nirvana,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 lam means path, path to the nirvana.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Everything what we see here in the universe and world

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 or in the samsara and nirvana can summarize in this three terminology of three.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Samsara and the nirvana and path to the nirvana.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Or samsara, path to the nirvana and the nirvana itself.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 So that is, that all has source.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 What is that source?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Here is in the brilliant explaining of the emptiness.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Emptiness is the source of everything.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 And that is generally, you know, in the Buddha teaching,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 there is true truth, generally true explaining.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 And the relative truth and the absolute truth.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 These are true truths.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Relative truth, exactly things what we see here.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Good, bad, existing, fire, water, everything is relative.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 It's all existing and it is there, is here.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 We cannot ignore that.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 That is relative.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 But nature of everything what we see is in the teaching mentioned,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 the emptiness.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 That is known as in the true truth level, absolute truth.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 So relative truth and absolute truth.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 So relative truth.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Relative truth is everything what we say is all relative.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 But the nature of the relative truth,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 or even though relative truth,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 how that is in the debate is called kundab.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 The debate about relative truth is kundu ji dema.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 Ku means all.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Dhamma is every translated that, illusion.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 And the truth is truth.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Dema means truth, sorry.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 So relative truth is in the debate about all illusion truth.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 All illusion truth.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 What that means actually is that even though they appeared,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 they are not really solid, existing, as weakling.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 They are like bubble.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 That's why the greatest teacher of Buddha used the example.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Bubble, mirage, reflection of the moon in the water, dream,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 and the double images.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 Images, it's all like that.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 This is not something solid existed.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Therefore, illusion.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 But then is the truth.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Why it's called truth?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Because it's functioning exactly as it is on the relative level.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 It's doing the job.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Therefore, it's the truth.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 It's just because the truth is not some solid existing truth,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 but it's functioning.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 It's performing the duty it is activating.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 It is.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 That's called relative truth.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 The absolute truth is that nature of this relative truth is absolute truth.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 That absolute truth is emptiness.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Nature is emptiness.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 Nothing is solid existing.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 It's empty.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 That is explaining more in later years, so we can talk more.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 But it is really beyond anything that you can hold.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 It's totally, totally evaporating.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 It's empty.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 The emptiness of quality is why it's called in Tibet, again,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 ton dham demba, ton dhamba demba, three words.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Ton dhamba demba.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 That if we translate it roughly that ultimate supreme truth,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 supreme, a roughly translation, ultimate supreme truth

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 or supreme meaning, meaning truth.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Because this is nothing, never going to change.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 This emptiness or this absolute truth is never going to change.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 It is beyond the changing, beyond any publications.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 It is always maintained as it is.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 For that reason, in the teaching we've heard so many times,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 whether Buddha comes to give the teaching on that is nothing changed.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 When Buddha does not come to give the teaching on that absolute truth, nothing changed.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Whether we are in samsara, it didn't change anything.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Whether we are in nirvana, it did not change anything.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Nature remains as it is.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 Therefore, it is called absolute truth or ton dhamba demba.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 But this one here, explaining, is the J and L, the foundation,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 the absolute truth, all the nature.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 What that is, actually, with kind of like more highlighting point,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 that is our nature of the mind.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Our nature of the mind is source of our samsara and our nirvana.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Our nirvana, one's own samsara comes from our mind.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 One's own nirvana comes from our mind.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 It's not coming from anywhere.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Anywhere, it is really the mind.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Mind, it is.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 How is this nature of the mind is?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Then, in the natural level, is emptiness.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Nature is emptiness, nature of mind.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 This name is also known as tathanga dangarbha.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 The Buddha nature is emptiness.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 In the Dokki teaching, many times highlight that,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 that nature of the mind is emptiness.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 That is dharmakaya.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 It has all the beautiful other qualities,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 such as sambokaya and namakaya.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 Namakaya.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 This emptiness is an emptiness of many seno names.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Emptiness, and also in another seno name, is dharmadhatu.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Dharmadhatu, emptiness, ultimate nature,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 true nature as it is, true nature in the Tibetan world,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 Tibetan world, world, such as tungvani, yan taupeng tau,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 tau, nyung mau, mau.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 Those are all the seno names of this emptiness,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 explaining of the emptiness aspect,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 the openness aspect of nature.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Yet everything comes from this emptiness mind.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 As I said, aliens, aliens said that, that's all, that.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 And then if I, so that means everything is an emptiness status.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 All is emptiness.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 That is the highlight of the absolute truth.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And, or maybe you can translate it,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 everything what you see in the universe and the world,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 everything what, nature is the emptiness.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Nature is a dharmadhatu.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 Nature is in the dharmakaya status.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Everything is in that status.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Essence of nature, all is emptiness.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 That great emptiness is then the foundation head.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Great emptiness is the foundation.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 Foundation, source of everything.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 That is grown.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 And this also explain in my understanding,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 my understanding is explaining of the,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 in the teaching of the mentioned.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 Growned, part, and the result.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Growned, part, and the result.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 In it read, it's called jai lam deva, deva.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 So this, from here, from the essence and nature

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 of the appearance existence is great emptiness.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 That is grown, foundation.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 Foundation again as I said many times.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Foundation of samsara, foundation of nirvana,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 foundation of everything, that is.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Now when you see the nature exactly as it is,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 now we're going to apply that to as part.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Then explaining of the part.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Part is not the part outside we follow,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 somewhere kind of outside.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Our part is to our spiritual enlightenment journey

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 as we practice and meditate.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 That is part.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Part.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 When we continue to practice and meditate in the part,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 and what is going to actualize?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 The result.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 That is then subcontinent actualized.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Subcontinent actualized.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 That is a result.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 So this first line is really explaining

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 of the growned part and result.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Have I used another terminology in the Dokki teachings?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 Growned zokchen, part zokchen, and result zokchen.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 Those are used and explain later to you more here.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 So this is the highlight of the breathing.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 This is great emptiness or great our nature of the mind.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 It contains, it is as it contains the ground or the foundation.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 It contains the part, it contains the result.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 All is within one single state of our nature of the mind.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 Growned is in our mind, of the samsara and the rana,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 and part of the enlightenment is in our mind,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 and achievement is in our mind.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 So that means all the everything in the Tibetan world,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 zhi, lam, devo, all that three within our nature of the mind.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Mind.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 That is highlight, highlight that, that.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 Highlight this, this.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 And with this, and now we go.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 The next one is then in the...

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 And now the next one is when you look to the page,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 again it's according to this booklet page, page nenden, nenden,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 and it's not little bit more detail explaining, explaining more detail.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Now, and...

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 So this is now, again I read is in English translation,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 the essence, the dharma kaya, the sukata garba.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 Garba is not adornated or changed by the samsara and the rana,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 free from the conceptualized extreme.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 It is endowed with the three gates of the liberation.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 So this is explaining about this, the ground.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 And the ground is, as I said earlier, is a tathanga than garba.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 And tathanga than garba is, this has many names,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 the ground has many names.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Tathanga than garba.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 And Buddha nature.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 And then also, and the clay light luminous the mind.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 And Ussar vayishi.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 And as well as the original mind.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 Mind.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 And Ussar vayishi.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 Yeah, Ussar vayishi.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 And then as well as the salt-boned awareness.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 So those all is really referring to the, to this tathanga than garba.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Tathanga than garba is generally Buddha teaching in Mahayana, Sutra.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 I mentioned that is most of the time terminology used as tathanga than garba.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Ote, vishyapanyam, for essence of the tathanga.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 Garba, essence of the Buddha nature.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Those are used then.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 So this is actually teaching on our nature of the mind now.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 And now this dharmakaya nature is, is tathanga than garba.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 And which is, is our mind, nature of the mind is never really changing.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 And the teaching said, from the beginning of this time,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 until now it remained exactly as it was.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 It was.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Nothing really changed.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 It's continually, continually the same.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 It has all the qualities of the Buddhas in life beings.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Everything is within this nature, nature, nature.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 And, and it's never going to change anything that.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 So this nature is, is the essence of dharmakaya is, I think,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 make it the elite, elite is true so many times.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 That the essence of dharmakamaya is, so that the garba is,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 cannot change by any samsara and nirvana thing.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 And when it reached enlightenment, it didn't become any better than that.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 Better.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And when we are in samsara, it becomes, then it got worse.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Exactly, just really remained the same, same as it was.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 Always, same thing.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 Nothing changed.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 How is this?

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 This is again, a great mass, Lunkimba said, maybe said this, this way,

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 that this old and natural is like as a sun and sky,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 brilliant, clay and unimpeded, open status.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 That, but then it is covered by the, the temporarily arising.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 And that old and natural is covered by the closeness of the duality

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 of consumption.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Consumption is completely covered that.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 But reality, nature is nothing changed.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 That means nature of the sky, nature of the sun.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Sun, billion, sun called it, never really changed all the time.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Even though it is thick clothes, in the covered completely or that,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 the nature is remained perfectly, beautifully as it is.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 So that is, and this call it is, how it is.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 Then, preform all the complexities, here it says,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 this is the, never can change by any means.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 And the preform the old concept like extremes

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 is endowed with the three guts of the liberations.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 So old, preform the old, consumption life.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 And that means the consumption is the preform of all the existing,

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 non-existing, neither and eithers.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Also this nature is, is totally preformed at aspects.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 Those the great master Nagarjuna said, as we joined,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 and this absolute interdependent co-ordination nature is preformed

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 to see, and preform the seizing, and preform the birth.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 And preform the nihilism,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 or temple, or extension,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 and preform the eternalism or permanent,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 and preform the coming, preform the going,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 is not neither one nor many.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Those are the at aspects of the great master Nagarjuna said,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 the nature of the interdependent co-ordination.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 What that actually means, interdependent co-ordination,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 that because the tathangada nay, kathangada nagarbha,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 is nature of the interdependent co-ordination.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Interdependent co-ordination means a rising display.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Interdependent co-ordination means the tathangada has all the power,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 tathangada nagarbha, our nature of the,

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 nature of the mind has all power to arising.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 Every display, every display of the conceptions arising,

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 without any shortages, is arising.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 Moment is arising, that moment is never lost in nature.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 Emptiness is kept continuing.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 That is how it is.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 For that reason, the great master Nagarjuna said,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 "App is the emptiness that is interdependent."

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 App is interdependent, that is emptiness.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 Interdependent and the emptiness are the same nature.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 So when you have the realization of the true nature,

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 exactly of the understanding of this perfect nature,

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 in that natural level, this interdependent arising energy

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 is free from all the other aspects.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 There is nothing really source,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 source in exactly the pinpoint location.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Even we can see all arising from the dharma dhatu,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 all arising from the tathangada nagarbha,

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 but where is arising?

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 We are trying to pinpoint a scientific way.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Also, by trying to pinpoint, there is nothing really.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 It is true.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 True.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 So for that reason, it is free from all the 'S' aspects.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 'S' aspects.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 And then, if you say the 'S' aspect or the simple way,

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 then it is free from the poor extremes.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Existing, non-existing, neither, neither.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 That's how this nature it is.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
 But yet, yet, it is free from all that nature.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 And then, same time, this is.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 Then liberated three doors.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
 Liberated three doors, what is that?

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 Explaining about, again, nature of the emptiness,

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 nature of this call of the tathangada dharma.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000
 Nature is free from three doors.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 And then, we use the metaphor in the Buddha's teacher,

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 'Door of the Enlightenment'. Three doors.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 When you have this realization,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 the cause is emptiness when you have the realization.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 That itself is the 'Door of the Enlightenment'.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
 The result is the emptiness if we realize that,

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
 that is also the 'Door of the Enlightenment'.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
 Nature of the both cause and result are free from the identity or the emptiness.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 That is the 'Door of the Enlightenment'.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 It's called three doors of the liberation.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 All that is, in a minute time, the practice of the lineage is applied to the mind.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 So not point externally, kind of, tripping point to exactly the whole side.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 Mind is free from the three doors of liberation.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 We look the past mind, where the past mind comes from.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
 That is cause. Mind is free from the cause.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
 Cause. So free from the cause.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
 Where you look, think about where mind went going there.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 Where we're going to go.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 It's not just the nation. You can't point anything.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 It's free from the result, going free from again.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:11.000
 And when you look the present mind, there is no mind, free from the identity.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 When you discover that free, free from, that is the 'Door of the Enlightenment'.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.000
 Because it is eliminating and softening our attachment, grasping, clinging.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 There is nothing to report, really. Mind is.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 And for that reason, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said in the, what's called,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
 'Rena kurta sutra'. It's called the 'Kontyutapam'.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 'Kontyutapam' though, in the Tibetan 'Kontyutapam' in Sanskrit 'Rena kutra'.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
 And in the English maybe.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000
 And erected, erected, built up, built up the jewels 'Sutra'.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 'Sutra' is a very famous 'Sutras'.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 It's a whole group of, there's many volumes of the teaching.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 And there's one of the teaching is having discussions.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000
 Like dialogue with the Buddha, with the Maha Kashyapas, or 'Kashyapa'.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 Buddha said, 'Kashyapa'.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
 'Kashyapa' mind is free from the 'Pocal Point'.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 'Pocal Point'.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
 When you don't have the mind, when you don't have the 'Pocal Point' mind.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
 So that means, seen in the Tibetan, seen 'Mukwate', the 'Devas'.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 But there's nothing to 'Pocus'.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 Mind is free from 'Mukwate' 'Deva'.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
 One way is free from the 'Pocus'.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 'Pocus' or free from 'Pocal Point'.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 That mind is not, that is free from past.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 That is free from future.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 That is free from the present.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
 That is free from any time.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 Mind is free from.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 Again, three times is 'Pocal Point'.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
 No, mind as when you don't have any 'Pocal Point'.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 Point, that 'Pocal Point' object is free from the three times.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 From the past, present and the future.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 And as I said here, the three doors of liberation in practice.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 Pointing out the nature of the mind teaching.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
 Always point, three doors of liberation to the mind.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 And mind is free from all that existence.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 So that means, 'atang gatang garba' is free from the three times.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 'Buddha' nature is free from the three times.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 It's olden and natural qualities.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 And therefore, it is indestructible, uncharitable.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 And for those reasons, as any teacher said,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
 it is beyond, it is great permanent, beyond permanent, impermanent.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 It is great purity, is beyond of the dirty and the cleans.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000
 And the great supreme, supreme is beyond existing and non-existing.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 Six things.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:29.000
 And it is great blasphemous beyond emotion, blissfulness and sufferings.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 It's old and natural qualities.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
 That is what 'atang gatang garba' is.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
 And that is how it is.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
 So this is, again, 'atang gatang garba' has explaining.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 So this has two qualities, 'brily'.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
 The collator of the emptiness, collator of the clarity.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 And the Dokhi teaching often mentions

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 that the nature of the mind is embodiment of three kayas.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
 The emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is dharma kaya.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 Clarity aspect of the nature of the mind is sambhokaya.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
 The union of the clarity and the emptiness is the dharma kaya.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
 So these explain of these.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 This essence of dharma kaya, sogang garba,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 is adult net and changeless from the samsara and nirvana

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 and free from all the complex cities

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
 and free from the full three liberation,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
 is highlight of the nature of the emptiness of the dharma kaya.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
 Dharma kaya is free from the emptiness aspect.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
 So all is empty.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 That is integration teacher,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 all the second turning wheel of dharma,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 which is known as the Pandya Paramata teaching,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 is highlighting all time.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 The emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 that rejoined also in the heart of the sadhara too.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Poem is emptiness.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
 Emptiness is form or that all in no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
 All that highlight of that negation away

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
 is highlight of the emptiness aspect of the dharma kaya,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.000
 dharma kaya, or emptiness aspect of the tathanga dangarba aspect.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 So in that level, in the teaching stage,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000
 from the poem, F-O-R-M, from the poem,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
 all the way to the enlightenment,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
 there is nothing existing solid.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 All is emptiness.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
 From the poem aggregate, all the way to the enlightenment.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
 Enlightenment.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 Always from the samsara to all the way nirvana,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 there is nothing substantial, solid, existing at all.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000
 At all is like teachings of the Absolute Truth, dharma kaya,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
 the emptiness aspect of dharma kaya, dharma dhatu or dharma kaya.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 All the tathanga dangarba's synonym is dharma dhatu.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 Dharma dhatu is tathanga, also synonym.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 That great, great master Nagarjuna said in his praise to the dharma dhatu,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 praise to the dharma dhatu if you look that.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 And in what he said in that,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
 one who does not understand the nature of the dharma dhatu,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 they are wandering in the samsara.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 One who saw the nature of dharma dhatu,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
 that itself is nirvana enlightenment.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 I pay homage to that dharma dhatu.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 That's the great master Nagarjuna said.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
 Dharma dhatu is tathanga dangarba, dharma gharba.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 But nature of tathanga dangarba,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 nature of the, it has a coded zoki teaching,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
 I mean not just zoki teaching,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
 in the teaching it has so many qualities.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
 One aspect of nature is emptiness, as Buddha said.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 The outer emptiness, in emptiness,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 between emptiness and, I mean all the 16 emptiness teachings mentioned

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
 in the Heart Center which is joined to, to.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 No palm, no eye, no nose, no tongue, I mean all that.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
 From the nirvana, from the...

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 there is no words, no gaining, no losing, losing.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 Those all, emptiness aspect one,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 Buddha highlight of that emptiness aspect,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 and emptiness aspect.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
 Why Buddha said that, highlight that, call it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 Because our notion of the duality is so strong,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 we're clinging, we're grasping, we are always clinging,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
 holding something.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 That clinging is not nature.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 That is obstacle.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
 To remove that obstacle, to release that hindrance,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
 then Buddha highlight of this,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
 the Pandya Paramada teaching,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 Pandya Paramada teaching,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 that which 100,000 stands the Pandya Paramada teaching,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
 highlight that, that.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
 But then, not just the Buddha left there,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 then explaining on the third 20 world of dharma,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 tathanga dangarba, that's what we're talking.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
 That tathanga dangarba teaching,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
 then explain, and what in the teachings said,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 the great Mahatma Mahatma said,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
 that teaching is highlighting of the,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
 the call it of the tathanga dangarba teaching.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 It's not just empty, empty,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 but it has all the call it is.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
 On another world, it has all the richness call it is.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 Richness call it is.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 Every richness, and that explain here,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
 then is in the continuing we go tomorrow now,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 to the here explaining.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 The five Gaya's, and the five wisdom's,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 the five that all is within the dharma Gaya states.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 All the five wisdom's, five Gaya's,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
 and power, and ability, understand everything

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
 within the dharma Gaya state.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 In that dharma Gaya or that tathanga dangarba state,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 everything.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 And that means what? For us.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
 We all have, for that reason,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
 we all have the Buddha, right in the heart, mind.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 In the Dzokhi teaching, often mentioned,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 youthful West body.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 Right in our heart center,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 this dathanga dangarba is recited,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 fully developed enlightenment.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
 In the teachings said, said, really,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
 it's fully developed enlightenment.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
 It's nothing have to add anything.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
 Nothing have to subtract anything.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
 And for that reason, there's a few moves,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 sutra or tandara teaching, go to ji lama said,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
 as it is, at well be is it is.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
 Never going to change, never going to utter net ends.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
 Nature, quality, remain exactly as it is.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
 That is nature.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 But why we don't, for that reason also,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
 I mean, in the end the teacher,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 I'm sure you heard, and I heard that's what I'm talking.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 Talking in the teaching said,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 all living beings are Buddha.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
 All living beings are Buddha.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 That's clearly said.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
 But why they're not, but now, why we're not,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
 then why we're sentient beings?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 Because they're obscured.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
 That Buddha is obscured.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
 They're misty, dark clothes, clothes, the garden.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 Otherwise, Buddha right here.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 And what is dark clothes?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 Our negative emotion is dark clothes

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 that one's own creations.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 Nobody else created in our Lord to us.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
 His one's own creature is dark clothes.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 It's covered.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
 Reality is here.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
 In this famous tandara called takwani bah,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
 tani dantara, in that teaching said,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 and everyone is, all,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
 in the Tibetan world,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 all these living beings are Buddha,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
 but they're obscured.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 And for those reasons, in the Gohanga,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:04.000
 not the Gohanga, but in Jilama,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 and Otara dantara,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 Otara dantara is a famous suttara teaching

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
 by the great master,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
 the great upcoming future Buddha,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 Maitre, Maitre, Maitre said,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
 there's nine different, or ten different examples

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 how our Buddha nature is covered up.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 Ten different examples that covered.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 Otherwise, it is right here, really.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 Right here. Right here.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 And those are the leading teaching.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 And so this now, the first one is explained,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 really about the call it,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
 emptiness aspect of the call it is,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
 and they were going to change

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
 by any means to any time that emptiness.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
 And then, and now, next one is explained

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
 of the clarity, richness call it,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 of the, of the, of the tatangata garbas.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
 Akhore Doki Tiki,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 his first one is explaining

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 about the highlight of Dharmakaya nature,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
 of the emptiness aspect of nature of the mind.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 And then, then, next one is explained

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 of clarity aspect of that.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
 And that, yeah, that is explaining.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 And so, that is really my talk today.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 And thank you very much.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 (Coughs)

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:35.000
 Dedicate the marriage, short dedication,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
 and the page, according to this page,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 180, 80 page.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 (Singing in Hindi)

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
 (Singing in Hindi)

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 (Singing in Hindi)

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 By this parent, may all obtain your ambitions.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 May I defeat the enemy in wrongdoing,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 from the stormy waves of earth,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 full age, sickness, and death,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 from the ocean of samsara,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 may I free all beings.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 May the soul source benefit in happiness.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
 The Buddha's teachings remain for a long time.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
 May the victory banner of the lives of the noble ones,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 the holders of the teachings remain firm.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
 May all the temples and monasteries,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 all the readings and recitations of Dharma flourish.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
 May the sangha always be in harmony.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 May our aspirations be achieved.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
 May all beings always be joyful.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 May all births into the lower ground cease forever.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
 May the wishes of all the Buddhists suffer,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
 and all the beings swiftly reach fruition.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 At this very moment, for the peoples and nations of the earth,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
 may not even the names, disease, famine, war,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 and suffering be heard, but rather may pure conduct,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 merit, wealth, and prosperity increase,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 and may supreme good fortune and well-being always arise.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
 The precious bodhicitta, in those without it, may be generated,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
 in those who have it, may it never diminish,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 but always continue increasing.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
 May the great tradition of the Kempo Shankarakshita,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
 Loba, Vama, Sambha, and Dharma King, Trisa and Detsen,

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
 increase and spread throughout the three-round world.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 May the appearance of the three jewels

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 and mind-streams of beings remain inseparable

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 and bring sublime well-being throughout the three times.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
 Deity, mantra, and Dharma Kaya

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 are the nature of appearance, sound, and awareness.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 The pervasive Kaya and wisdom display of the Buddhas

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 may practitioners of the profound and secret great perfection

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 remain inseparable from the innermost,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:37.000
 one-case awareness of wisdom.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 OK. Thank you, everyone.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 Thank you. Thank you very much for participating.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 Dashi Delhi. Thank you very much.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
 And also, I thought to really encourage all of us to do

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
 that this one, we're trying to do as much as we can do practices.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 In the Nyungma teaching, in a particular great temple,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Kanyipati, you all pretty mentioned that to us.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
 And I remember that all the time.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 Nyungma school, always combined together,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
 studying and meditation together, studying.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
 So in this case, for example, one week we're doing practices,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
 but also we're doing studying in the morning,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
 kind of together as much as we can learn

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
 and the studying of the teaching,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 particularly connected to the zokin, zokin on the inner tandana.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 And the apranong, then we put that in the practices.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 So in a way, so I'm trying to come also really participate

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
 in those morning activities and as well as apranong activities.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 And I want you all to encourage.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
 So please also participate in our apranong practices too.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 It's really combined. Apranong is the practices really.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
 Morning is starting in a way, kind of a little learning.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 Learning and also at least we're reminding to our knowledge

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
 what we already learned, something, some durgidad.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 In an apranong really we practice.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 And then it's called the union of the studying

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 and the practice togit.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
 In the teaching of apranong meditation,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 mostly important is really in the Buddha teaching practices, so important.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
 Study is important because why?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
 You have to know what are your practices.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 And once you know that, then practice means observing

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 that teaching into the heart, heart,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 and not left on the brain or the intellectual levels.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
 Intellectual level living, the realization won't come.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 And for those reasons, in the great masters,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
 great learned scholars have to do practices.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 For example, Eun-Chin-Bam.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 He's really one of the greatest scholars in all time.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
 But that is not enough.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
 He left through the mountains

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 and went to the teacher in the practice.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 That's in it a bit. In India, often there are so many great masters,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
 those six ornaments of Buddhism, really.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 Because they learn, they're so great scholars.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
 They're so intellectuals.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 Not just believers, they're really intellectuals.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
 Thinkers, so famous thinkers, so genuine thinkers.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.000
 But then, that's not enough to get something realization.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.000
 Then went meditating, practices in Naropa tree.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
 And it was one of the great scholars in the teaching field.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
 But that's not enough.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
 Being a scholar, practices is the most important.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
 Realization comes from the practices.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 For example, Mohan Ambuji, he's a big scholar, naturally.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 He's not just went to academic schools in so many years and all that.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
 But because he's a genius, really.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
 Manjushri came as human poems, you know.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
 No, but then in our life story, when we read,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 and we heard so many stories from the order,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
 always on the mountain, always on the hermitage,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 practicing meditating, that.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
 So this, and then as well as the false, great chinti,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
 false, great kungro.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
 In their life story, how much they practice meditating.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 They know all the things.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
 But practice is so important.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 So therefore, of course, when we're busy, we're doing something,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 then that's a really great thing we need to do.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 So that was definitely.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
 But if you don't have to do, not too urgent, all these things,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 it's definitely practice.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
 I think they're really wonderful.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
 And I just like to encourage you to practice.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 We'll talk it, OK?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 Thank you.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 I mean, welcome, welcome, everyone.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
 Thank you so much, everyone.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 Thank you.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 Thank you.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
 Thank you.
