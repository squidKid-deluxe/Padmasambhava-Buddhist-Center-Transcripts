00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 I have a question about all of us, everywhere seeming to be so busy, we don't have so much

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.760
 time for practice or study, most of us. So it's a question about study. One way to put

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is, what is the minimal amount of study we have to do for Dzogchen practice to start

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.760
 well and stay on track? Another way to say that is, what are the essential intellectual

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.520
 points that we really need to have clear in our minds for our meditation to go well?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:55.080
 And generally, studying is really important. And what is called in the Buddha teaching?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 Studying is important. Studying is the study of the Buddha teaching. Those are really important

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.840
 because that's what we like to practice. So therefore, to know these things, so far, study

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 is important. And I will say, studying also in the context of the like, such as Suttara

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.680
 and Vaidyayana. Studying on the Suttara and the Suttara, studying on the Vaidyayana teachings.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.360
 And the Dzogchen is Vaidyayana. So therefore, these three, kind of two things is really

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.120
 important. Suttara level, then Adien Hinayana and Suttara Mahayana, Suttara, a little bit

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.600
 of study. And those are like, then, such as those, his only, the new room which is teaching,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.280
 three hours, I had his last letter into, those really gives about all those teaching and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 including Vaidyayana teaching. So I will say that. And then for us also, studying, such

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 as guide, in the way of the lives of the body of Suttara, you know, those are very wonderful.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.160
 I mean, those are the essential practice, not just wonderful. They are really so important.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.320
 So, study level, then, in the Vaidyayana teachings, there are so many books now, but some, the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.120
 Lunkimba's books, all the you know what it's teaching, those are quite awesome. All the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 great masters, the Yangmukungrung teaching, which is known as the tree, knowledge of trade,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 which is a very big, even though it's kind of like, Yangmukungrung himself is very, very

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.760
 big in practitioners or big in students, those who like to study, they don't have time to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.560
 go, big things, but actually it's really big. So kind of some of those really will open

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.240
 the door. Or then, Mumarung, which is what's called the knowledge, guide to knowledge,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 guide to knowledge. Those are, I mean, those are just, I'm not saying very good, they are,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.280
 that's also really good. In that Vaidyayana teaching, this Lunkimba's teaching, and I don't

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.040
 translate that, but also, this, I mean, all there's so many, so really, as many as you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.680
 can do that is good, good as many. But also, that's according to your time, but read and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 then, and then also, I would say really, if you have time, also read some life story of

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.120
 those great masters, it's also very inspiring. Really, we saw how great the teachers, they are,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.520
 and yet, how they are humble and simple, and how dedicated, how their devotions, even their highest

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:38.040
 realization, yet they are like full of the relations, full of the devotions, full of body,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.040
 really, just that, resource and simple and humble. Those are very kind of appealing,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.400
 and for the practice, that's really good. So, they read a few times, every time, those great

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.480
 masters' life stories, which is really good. And then, for the practice, for the meditations,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 then, I think, to starting things, I think, always in the teaching set, always that about how the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.960
 teaching comes, and then, let it be starting about the pose I was called. In the Tibetan,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.200
 ground, path, and the result. Let it be kind of knowledge on ground,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.160
 and the path, and the result. And then, ground, starting about ground. What is ground? Ground is,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.720
 again, metaphor, metaphor, but ground is what? But usually in samsara, samsara, ground is best

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.000
 by everything. So, therefore, in the realization, where is best? And the starting of that best,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.640
 best. And then, starting about the path. We need to come to the path, and then, what they divide as

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:54.680
 will, meditation, and conduct. Again, everybody started with what means will. What means

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.400
 meditation, or practices. What means, or what is about the conduct. Start a little bit that,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.000
 that as, and as a kind of a need it. And then, result. I mean, you don't need to start it,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.120
 because those are all cause, then result will come. Those are the cause. There's nothing really

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.080
 have to result. Start it too much, it is all. But also result, you can start what that,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.960
 what that will bring the result, or the fruit. So, if you're starting kind of a little bit those,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.440
 those things, or those like teaching that explained already that, and you heard that

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.240
 many times, maybe reactivating in our knowledge as much as you can, then those are known as

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.160
 that study, which is study is really good. But when also starting in a new my teaching,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.760
 it's getting what they should have said many times. New my school, we don't make a big separation

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.560
 between starting the practice and cooperating. What are you starting? You practice it? What

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.480
 you are practicing? Also you are learning that they kind of trivial out both, call it together,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.520
 and that is really kind of keep that scope of the vision, and then practice.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.160
 Okay, thank you. Then we start.
