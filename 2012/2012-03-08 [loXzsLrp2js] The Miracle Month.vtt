00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
 "But according to the Tibetan calendar, the alumina calendar, our gracious, kindness teacher,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.160
 Buddha Shakyamuni, performed so many beautiful miracle activities, which is the beneficial

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.180
 activity that inspires so many couples in the state of kindness, compassion, love, respect

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.560
 and appreciation, understanding each other's meaning of life and meaning of the nature.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 That is what the miracle activity is known as.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.080
 The Buddha Shakyamuni, many of you know already, but knowing again, I always think we all know,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 but we also, I'm talking this in the commemorating of our great teachers, is our way to inspire

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.320
 ourselves and following the footsteps of these great teachers, according our best capabilities.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.200
 So great teacher Buddha Shakyamuni was born two thousand, about six hundred years ago,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:12.160
 and he stayed in the kingdom on the palace until age 29, then he left the kingdom, and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 seeing how to remove all suffering, the difficulties, troubles that we send in things go through,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.040
 and how to release that, and how to bring the meat of those troubles, bring some meanings

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.480
 of our lives and our destinations.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.800
 And all those searching, thinking, and Buddha left, came down and then reached enlightenment

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 at age 35.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.440
 As you heard many times, Buddha Shakyamuni performed twelve beneficial activities, principal

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.880
 beneficial activities.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 Among twelve, always, the port is even more principal, and those are known as the activity

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 of the birth, activity of the enlightenment, activities of the turning the wheel of dharma

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.680
 or the teaching, and the activity of the entering the Mahabharic Naranas.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.760
 There's four principal activities.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 So at age 35, Buddha reached enlightenment, which is second, his principal activity after

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.640
 taking the birth.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 At the same year, at the same age, 49 days after his enlightenment, Buddha turned the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 wheel of dharma.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.680
 And the wheel of dharma means message of love, kindness, compassion, exploring or how to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:49.280
 explore our innate beautiful qualities of ours, yours, and mine, and everyone's.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.800
 That's what the teaching, in the context of respect, appreciation, nonviolence, and peace,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.040
 and harmony, and simple, that's what teaching's are.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.920
 And so, the teaching was the third major activities, among that four I'm calling, there's twelve

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.520
 major activities, among twelve, the four are the highest, or principal activities.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.320
 And then, at age 81 or 82, Buddha entered Mahabharic Naranas, which is known as the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.640
 port principal activities.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.720
 So even Buddha Shakyamuni said in the teaching, "Apramai Mahaparin Narana, your disciples

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.360
 and followers of the teachings go to those four places, where Buddha was born, the Lumbini,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.720
 where Buddha reached enlightenment, Buddha Gaya, and where Buddha turned the wheel of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.640
 dharma and modern name known as Saranat or the Varanasi, and then where Buddha entered

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.720
 Mahaparin Narana, the Kushina, those are the four different places.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.840
 Among that four activities, principal activities, then the teaching is even more spiritual activity

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.440
,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.720
 because the purpose of enlightenment, the principal beneficial activity of the Buddha

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.600
 is teaching.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.880
 Teaching is the most powerful activities, among all his activities.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.080
 So this miracle activity is connected to the teaching activities.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:41.280
 It is inspiring, it is special, it is beautiful, it is discovering the total new dimension

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.000
 of the reality of the nature, where things are.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.280
 According to Buddhism, miracle is not just a magic, or not just a making-up, but miracle

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.920
 means to discovering the nature's structure as it is.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.080
 The nature, when you become the master of the nature, in one way, when you become the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.520
 master of the contramicular, when you become the master of the contramicular, there is

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:22.200
 no restrictions, no restrictions, no restrictions, or there is no boundaries, or is, according

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.280
 to Buddhism, is of more kind of energy and light levels.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.200
 It is beyond the light metals, it is shimmering light status.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.440
 When you become the master of that, your mind is in that status.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.600
 Therefore, things change, things can change.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.480
 When you change in that level, you see then different things happen, it is not something

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.680
 that really making up things and tracking the eyes, but showing the beauty and this

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.000
 freedom, the flexible, the openness of the nature as it is.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.040
 That is what miracle is.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.640
 For that reason, great master Nala Juna said in the teaching, "When you understand the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.600
 meaning of the great emptiness, everything is possible, everything is freedom, there

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.280
 is no restrictions, all is can be, all can be."

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.720
 For that reason, fire turned into the water, water turned into the fire, big can be small,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.320
 small can be big.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.440
 The big and small, these restrictions is duality conceptions, because that means we are not

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.680
 master of the comprehension, nuclear status, we are not master of the natural.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 When you become the master of the nature, where the nature is, everything is flexible,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.480
 so therefore, Buddha showed of the natures a flexible freedom, it is way how things can

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.640
 be manifested and transformed, reappeared in many ways, and that for that is known as

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.960
 the miracle activities, which show the true meaning of the way nature is, or the phenomena

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.960
 that is natural existing.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:20.320
 So, according to Buddha's teaching, Buddha showed that miracle activities at the beginning

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:28.840
 of this lunar calendar, they first and continually did until the full moon, so for two weeks

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.120
 or three days, Buddha continually did that miracle activities.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.680
 Where he did perform that activities is in the Kiarastha.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:44.600
 So, Kiarastha is the one of the mostly, again, important holy site in Buddhism, not just

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:54.160
 Buddha performed miracle activities there, but also Buddha stayed there about 25 years,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:02.600
 and this become the longest place the Buddha stayed in one place, after the Kingdom.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:11.560
 He stayed at Kingdom 29, and he lasted 25 years, on and off, on and off, 25 years of

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
 Buddha spent.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.040
 So, he is considering as like his principal places, and Buddha performed miracle activities

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:27.880
 for 15 days, and started this last week, and continually, until this next, or next week,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.360
 activity, I think, I mean, first always on the full moon status, and this is, therefore,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:42.040
 this is also called activity, always known as is multiplying months, because in the teaching

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:50.200
 said, said, when you activity, whatever you do, miracle activities, it will multiply 100,000,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.400
 100,000 times that power and energy is, because this is something really special.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.000
 Buddha generally always do these activities, not just kind of do randomly, or kind of just

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.040
 happened, but Buddha do specifically meaningful ways, everything, everything has the meaning

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.920
 and purpose of that, it's not just kind of like casually happened, and Buddha did knowingly

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.840
 perform the activities.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.280
 Everything is in clear, wisdom-like status, and therefore, his miracle activity, the time,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.960
 timing is very special, timing is a waking time, and for example, also in that way, and

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.840
 this is according, I mean, I think everywhere, is spring time is coming.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:45.880
 Spring is generally growing times, it is time of growing, and again, it's called Buddhism,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.360
 in the teaching, in particular in the video, and the teaching said, what do you see outside,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:56.600
 and that you will see with our system of physical, and what physical level you, what do you see,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:05.520
 you see the outside, so the spring, summer, autumn, winter, that circle, also similar

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.800
 pattern taking with our physical, energy, and levels, and therefore, for example, again,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:19.520
 Buddha performed these miracle activities in this special time of the spring time, which

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:27.520
 is growing, upcoming, lashing time, as you see, and that has similar pattern is taking

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:36.520
 inwardly to you, therefore, every kind of use that system, that growing, that opportunity,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:44.520
 really practices with activating our meditation of goodness things, it will then move faster,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.520
 stronger, deeper.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.520
 It is similar, for example, I think when you do the, what do you do, when you do the surfing,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:11:02.520
 those who do surfing, it's good to have high ties, I think, right, good to have high ties.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.520
 Without a high tie, even you have the surfing board under your arms, you can't do too much

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.520
 surfing, but when you have these nice high ties, if you do the surfing, or even you learn

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:22.520
 the surfing, that is the time, I think, time. And when you like to ski, skiing, not just

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.520
 having the ski gear is enough, you have to have the snow. I think you have to have all

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 those slops and whatever that is, then you can do the surfing. Similarly, this, everything

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.520
 is connected, everything is related, everything is given teaching to us, reminded to us,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 it's all sense. And when these energies stay at such kind of opening times, if we use these

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.520
 opportunities, then there is a great window of light of the enlightenment and good energies

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 are blooming. And for those reasons, then this miracle month, this is what we call it,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.520
 multiply month, miracle month, whether performed miracle activities because of the beautiful

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.520
 time that we followers can activate in our enlightenment activities and our kindness,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.520
 compassion, bodhicitta activities, and then that will help us and that help to the other

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.520
 being. So therefore this, again, this month is known as a very special month, as many

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.520
 of you know, but also same time you can do practice such as get together in the Sangha

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.520
 member as as community. Again, in the Buddha, always teaching the Sangha getting together

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.520
 is something so special because they have similar intention. You will all come with

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:48.520
 the same intention, love, compassion, respect, joy, and devotion to the Dharma, to the teaching,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 to the practice. That is the motivation we can. We didn't come to win or to gain something

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.520
 different color like in the samsara level, but to something so very inspiring to deepen

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.520
 our understanding, calm, peace, relax, those are the many reasons we can. So we've come

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.520
 with that intention, we put together, then it matters strongly. You know, often in the

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:19.520
 teaching say, poor Sangha members, poor individual practicing comes together, it fills up the

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 corners, corners, it matches strength. And one person, for example, even used Buddha,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 one, what's called, one grass can be easily bred, bred, but group of grass put together,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.520
 it has strength, it cannot. Similarly beautiful motivations we put together and directed

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 that whatever we dedicated such as this marriage prayers, dedication prayers, that they need

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:55.520
 benefit to the others, and then benefit to ourself. So therefore practicing this time,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.520
 of course always practice is very special, but this time is very, very special time to

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:08.520
 practices. It is said, it multiply hundred thousand times, hundred thousand times. And

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.520
 our friend, Kindipa Nijerum, always you say, this is that this time, there is quite few

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:20.520
 times in a year, this kind of time comes, and you always say, this is the bonus time,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.520
 this is the bonus time. For the practicing, this is really bonus, and we can act directly

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.520
 at that. That it will benefit to us and to the others, and this might just be reminding

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.520
 and this even quicker.
