00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 So this is what the God of Karma Chagme is. Now in the Nalanda Monastery Universalist says,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 "We know the author." Now you pretty much understand about the quality of these teachings.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 But however, Watan said, "When you write the book in the Nalanda Monastery Universalist,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.600
 of course, all is in the Buddha's teaching best. You have to have three colleges, at least three

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000
 colleges, to write the book.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.300
 The first college of the writing book of the commentary on the Buddha's teaching, you have to have

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 the realization of the natural,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.280
 realization of the true nature of the great emptiness, exactly as it is, not theoretical, not just

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 intellectual, but exactly as it is.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:14.240
 That, if you have that colleges, that is the best colleges, best, I don't know, I forget, what do

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 you call it?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Best, best resonance, best, best resonance to activate your profession in the teachings, best.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Second, call it, is just behold the Buddha, past to face, or the enlightened beings, past to face.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Buddha, Gharapayama Sambha, or Guru, Dakini, all the bodies are past to face. That's the second,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 the College of the Resumes.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.370
 Third one, is understanding, entirely teaching of the Buddha, Buddha, and know knowledge of the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.000
 five sciences, according to the ancient term,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 those five sciences, I'm not going to listen to all this now, the five sciences.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 If you have those one with three colleges, then you are, you can write the books, write, make the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.000
 commentaries on the teaching of the books.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.210
 Otherwise, that book, maybe, that right bureau, what you're writing is maybe not really in line in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.000
 the teaching, maybe it will mislead the others.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 So those are the teachings, those are the three colleges of the authors when you write the books.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 In this case, the great Master Karma Chami has all that things, nothing is missing.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.290
 He has a realization, he does all the great Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to face, and he knew all the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.000
 teachings of the Buddha as we read books, all this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.420
 Many of those books we wrote, he wrote the books of our Pippin in the most turn out says, but I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.000
 heard this before, even though hundreds is lost to that books.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 But when he wrote those books, it's not that he went to the library in a co-op in that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.570
 As students can, he just has a continuous thought. So that means his end-bomb wisdom and knowledge

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.000
 is pervasive, shining everywhere and perfectly excited as it is.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.770
 And this is what this great Master is, and he has perfect quality of all these three. Therefore,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.000
 his teachings are nugget go.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.250
 His teachings are wish-fulfilling jewel. Those who are seeking for enlightenment make meaningful of

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 this life and to benefit to themselves, to benefit to the others.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 His teachings are the wish-fulfilling jewels. So that is really a border, a border-arther, really.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And then of course, more letters, I think is in here too, that you can read.
