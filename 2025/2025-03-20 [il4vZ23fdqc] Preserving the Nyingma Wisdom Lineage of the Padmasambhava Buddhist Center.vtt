NOTE     "synopsis": "Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche teaching Yangsi Rinpoche and the monks of Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling monastery in Sarnath, India on March 20, 2025!\n\nWe're so grateful for your support of the education of Yangsi Rinpoche and the young monks of Orgyen Samye Ch\u00f6khor Ling!\nwww.padmasambhava.org/monk-sponsorship\n\n\"In general, in Tibetan Buddhism the enthronement of a yangsi, or reincarnation is very, very important because it reactivates, re-glorifies, and empowers the reincarnation, and acknowledges that the yangsi will keep the legacy and vision of their previous incarnation. At the same time, it deeply honors the vision and activities of their previous incarnation, and requests the yangsi to continue to carry that same legacy. This is why an official enthronement ceremony is very important. . . . . In Tibetan Buddhism, when we do an enthronement ceremony we\u2019re really hoping, wishing, and praying that the yangsi reincarnation will carry on these responsibilities without any obstacles or hindrances, and that he will experience a lot of fulfillment and even expand the activities of the previous master.\"\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nApril 2019 Interview at PSL\n\nDownload the entire interview here:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/pema-mandala-back-issues/spring-summer2019",
