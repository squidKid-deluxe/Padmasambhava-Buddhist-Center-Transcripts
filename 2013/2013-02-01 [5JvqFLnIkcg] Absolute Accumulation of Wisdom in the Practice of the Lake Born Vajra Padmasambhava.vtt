00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 Absolute marriage practices. This is what absolute marriage practices. This is explaining that we

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 are relaxing on the state of the awareness.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 Look at this. We read, "Aa" is the syllable, Sanskrit syllable, which means the absolute natural.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.000
 It's beyond of the complexities, beyond the beginning, ending, and beyond anything.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.330
 It's all natural states, beyond the conceptions. And they said, "We invoke the lama, the omnip

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.500
resent awareness."

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 That is absolute truth. That is our awareness. Ourness, omnipresent awareness, emptiness.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 Relaxing our mind in that natural state, we invoke. That means, what is invocation?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 Invocation is just merely rediscovering our or your inner nature. That is named here as invoke.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.370
 You invoke, you breath, you highlight that consciousness. That is relaxing that. Staying and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.500
 relaxing that natural stateless.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 Then we are going to do all these ten marriage activities. Those are, each line is like that, one,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 so it's one, two, three.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 There's ten lines. These are all the marriage activities or the absolute truth. And what are those?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.630
 Those are invoke is one. And "be seated" is two. And then "perform" is three. And "man offering" is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.500
 four.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 And "we confess" is five. And "rejosing" is six. And then "turning the veil of dharma" is seven.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 And then "remaining" is seven. And then "dedicating" is eight. And then "me attending" is like me.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 These are aspirations. Aspiration is ten. So those are ten points of this accumulation practices.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.500
 So now, first is your highlight of your inner nature, which is the absolute teacher, absolute Lama,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 absolute Buddha.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 That is ever presented within our self. Highlight that, call it. When you highlight that, call it.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 Now we are going to keep that all the time without any exit.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.620
 You might be seated upon inward throne. That means we're not let going to fell down that with dual

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.500
ities. Not going to let fell down. So maintain that presence forever as it is.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:31.950
 And then, by recognizing that, call it, as it is, is that is then the postration, homage. With

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.500
 great joy and great appreciation.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:45.500
 Just endure. As without subtle object. This is the great postration of the absolute levels.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.500
 Then, what you make an offering? It's already existing. Already inherent, call it, is the offering,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 it is abundance of this nature.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:18.220
 So here, all, and offer all that appears within the ground of beings. All, and offer all that

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.500
 appears within the phenomena of the cosmos, cosmos of the phenomena.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.800
 Everything but ever appear, all ground of the beings, that must be, must be. So, that is what we

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.500
 offer.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.050
 It's already, there is nothing to give, like as offering, as sucking object. Everything what you

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:45.500
 see, what you hear, what you feel, and sense is the luxuries of the awareness.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:56.280
 It's already, it's never came, and never gone. It's ever. That is the great luxuries, great

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.500
 richness, and just reaffirming what is solemnly.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.720
 And that is great offerings. What do you confess in here? Here, I confess, not recognize that

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 nature until now.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:22.470
 That is, there is nothing to confess, as wrong and bad, except not recognize these marvelous,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.500
 awesome richness qualities, qualities that is.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.500
 So, as we recognize today, we are going to maintain, keep up this call, as it is.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.890
 And the rejoice is, then, there is a rejoice on great happy and joy, that state of beyond, meeting

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.500
 and departing.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.160
 That again is, it's not, never going to go away. Whether we recognize that, never not recognize, it

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.500
's not going to change anything.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.040
 But today, how wonderful, this is always here. That is what I rejoice, I'm happy to listen to this

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.500
 nature.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.500
 And then, because in turn, the will of dharmon, or echoes of the song of emptiness.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:18.090
 This is song of this nature. The words of the wisdom, words of the compassion, word of the loving

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.500
 kindness, is the deep core of nature.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:33.500
 It's the energy, movement of the Buddha-nature, or the awareness-lama, awareness of the lama,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500
 absolute awareness-lama of the emptiness.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:49.050
 Emptiness is circled and harbored by the voice of love and compassion, on the visible level and the

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.500
 subtle levels.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:59.500
 The subtle level is the ongoing running energy, energy of the movement.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:08.510
 And which is, then, again, just as it is, continually to ignite that guidance, that energy, that

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.500
 rhythm.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.500
 So, that is, again, it's turning the will of dharmon.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:22.500
 And then, and that remains in support of the presence. And that is always here, all the time.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:32.500
 To hear and remain all from this, and that is what it is. Then, wish to stay forever.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.500
 Oh, yes, it's forever. I'm not just wishing. It is here all the time.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:44.500
 And that is how wonderful, how beautiful I call that nature as it is.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.470
 And this, whatever accumulated through this, whatever the energy by recognizing these qualities,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.500
 that means I will dedicate it to the out of them,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.500
 to all the sentient beings, through the dharmakaya status, or the dharmadhatu.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.500
 That means I delegated this nature to the space.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:15.500
 The space is pervasive to everyone. Everyone, therefore, there is nothing have been discriminated.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:26.280
 I dedicated, I just murdered this energy, this power to the space, so that it pervasive to

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.500
 everywhere.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.860
 By that, everyone reach, everyone become a youthful vast body of the ordinary, their nature, free

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.500
 from the dualities, free from the deluded status.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:47.500
 That is the aspiration free. So, all this is known as the worst of merits.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:54.140
 Relax our mind in the awareness state, as in the beginning, and with that, and then can highlight

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.500
 of this call at one after another, that.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.500
 And this is then the worst of merits of the absolute truth.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.500
 This merits the absolute truth to capture this realization, to bring up this realization.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:16.830
 Otran said, then again, to withdraw, then it devotions. Devotions, confidence are very important in

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.500
 teaching.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:25.160
 Otran said, that will really bring the more meaningful, more highlight, and we can realize this

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.500
 nature as it is.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500
 So, that is really about this accumulate in the merits.
