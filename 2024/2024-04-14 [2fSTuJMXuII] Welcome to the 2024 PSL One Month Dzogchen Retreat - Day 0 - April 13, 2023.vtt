00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.450
 Thank you. Again, we do practice and meditation of Dzogchen toghede. It is one of the, I think, I

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.000
 sincerely talk it. It is one of the very wonderful moments where we all can do Toghede.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 We received so many teachings, so many teachings since you all entered the Dharma, and also I too

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.220
 received a lot of teachings that I think is really very important to practice more meditation and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.000
 practice, and to cultivate more love and compassion and joy and bodhicata in the heart behind.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.920
 Along with that Dzogchen meditation. Dzogchen meditation is the absolute bodhicata, so it is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.000
 nothing separated from the bodhicata. Dzogchen is the big of all the practicing teachings.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 And Dzogchen embodies all the practices, such as joy, appreciation, love and kindness and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.960
 compassion taught. All that really, that is more relative, outreaching. Love, joy, appreciation,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000
 bodhicata to all the beings, that is more outreaching.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.540
 But inwardly to activate it more deeply of the understanding of one's own in the nature of the mind

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.000
, and the discovery it is beauty and treasure. That is really Dzogchen practices.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.460
 So I think, combine it together in the teaching, always in the union of the two merits,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 accumulation merit and the western merit. And accumulation merit practice is all those joy,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.000
 appreciation and bodhicata.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 And the western merit is then Dzogchen meditation, and Dzogchen meditation. So I think that we are

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 all going to focus on this, and I am going to give the teachings about three times in a week, but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 then beside that also with you and me, all of us really trying to cultivate more, kind of now,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.000
 deepen our practices, deepen our bodhicata, deepen our joy and appreciation,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.510
 deepen a more understandable, whole renunciation thought. All four different points that change the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.000
 mind, really, with more practice, more happy, and more determination, more courage, more commitment

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 to make meaningful of my life, or the rest of my life.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 I believe this world is full of confidence and joy, and connected with future plans, in a way,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.730
 destinations, and we're not going to lose the conclusion in which I am living my journey on the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.000
 departures, in this time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.140
 I really feel those strong heart and mind, and feel also same time, by the blessings of the old,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.330
 the blessed, the modest, the converged, and the somewhat linear, masterful, blessed, to profile our

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.000
 all, the genuine, very beautiful, rich that we have, really, to kind of profile those qualities.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 The abundance of the richness of the trail that we discovered with our mind, from our mind, and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.000
 live that this world with this.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.010
 And the legacy of what we're able to achieve in this life, for the externally, we leave that for

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.870
 the benefit of all living beings, to secure the Buddha teaching, for same time, to kind of bring

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.000
 more abundance of the good qualities checked with us, that richness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And that is really the practice, symbol of the practitioners. What are you going to practice on?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.870
 Opti-meditation, or those old great masters, like, such as when you read the life story of the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:04:00.790
 great masters, and the Buddhas too, Bharatas, and Bodhisattvas, everyone, really, really, life

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.460
 story, they have completely fulfilled their goal, externally, but same time, they really fulfilled

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.000
 so much their goal and treasure from heart and mind.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.750
 And not just a kind of talking, talking, but truly in heart and mind. And then that is really, they

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.000
're so important, and that is really the practices.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.530
 And we're trying to really make this retreat, as we've always been one, we've been trying to get

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.000
 practices, a small group, to get practices, cultivating, that's been so good.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.780
 And I just want you all to really understand that those qualities, and make this meaningful of our

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.000
 time together, and it is wonderful.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.100
 We have beautiful places, and with great kindness, in comparison of all, so many Dharma patterns,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:49.450
 really, we have beautiful, now we enjoy, and kind of make this meaningful to cultivate our strength

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.000
 and the treasures of the mind.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.780
 So I think I'm going to read some of the things, I'll get it again, but thank you, thank you so

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.000
 much everyone for coming, everybody, and thank you, thank you, thank you.
