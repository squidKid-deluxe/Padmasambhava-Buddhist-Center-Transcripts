00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The video is recorded on April 3, 2017, and will be recorded on April 4, 2017, and will be recorded

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 on April 4, 2017.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.770
 Sanga members and spiritual friends are very necessary and important to gain the realization and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 improve our realization.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.300
 We do that, we won't. And for that reason, what in the teaching said, and the great master Buddha

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.000
 Shakyamuni said, known as Sutta Sesayangata, Nodoba, Nodoba Sesayangata said,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.980
 "Every virtues are depended on the Sanjay Devotee." Every Buddha teaching, teaching of the Buddha

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.000
 Dharma, is depended with spiritual friends.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Therefore, they should contract with spiritual teachers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 And that means we need to know something. We should contract with experts, or who have some

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.000
 knowledge.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 And that is spiritual friend. Spiritual friend is what? Again, to contract is so important to the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 spiritual friend, or be with good friend is so important.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.310
 Again, in another way, the teaching said, for example, again, always in the teaching said that in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.000
 Southern India, there are so many sandal woods.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 They called them the ancient time of now to that. So many sandal woods.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 If that sandal wood area, if you leave the regular wood with that sandal wood area, the regular

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 wood will get fragrance of the sandal wood.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 Similarly, if you really contract and be with a qualified teacher, teacher that will make the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.000
 difference, it will ignite your goodness, your goodness, goodness.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So therefore, qualified teacher here said, "Sindhi Lama." "Sindhi" qualified teacher. "Sindhi" "S

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.000
indhi" "Damba Lama." "Om" "Sindhi Lama."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Qualified teacher. That is a short contract. And that is the Buddha's teaching then, always.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:18.290
 Teacher said, "Pose, you should be expert to examine them or to finding the qualified teachers. Be

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.000
 expert to finding qualified teacher."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Second, be expert, qualified to contract with that qualified teacher or qualified spiritual friend.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 To be expert, how to contract, how to relate to that. Third, be expert to learn from that qualified

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 teacher. Every aspect, every aspect.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.090
 That's what the realist teaching says. And that is the Poxam read life story of all those great

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.000
 masters. Masters. Poxam's great master, Lunkimpa.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 He found qualified teacher, he is like his commonly connected root teacher, Rveda Dara Kumarajas.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.100
 He contract with, when he saw, when he found that, he contract instead with according to teaching,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.000
 he stayed with six years.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.780
 Six years and it is even teaching. Lunkimpa has already great scholars before he came to Ranzi

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.000
 Kumarajas.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.450
 He is renowned as master of all other teachings. He came one of that time, not one of the most

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.000
 famous monasteries in the center of it.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 That time, the most famous monasteries in the center of it. That time, the most famous monasteries

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 in the center of it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.130
 He become the top of top among those brilliant students. He is the expert of all the teachings, but

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.000
 yet he need to contract to qualify a teacher.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.930
 Qualified teacher, he contract with this great master, Ranzi Kumarajas or Veda Dara Kumarajas, for

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.000
 six years.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.150
 Ranzi Kumarajas, what they do in the teaching set? In the teaching set, his style, Ranzi Kumarajas,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:36.000
 he has so many practitioners with him, students with him, but they don't stay at one place.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Ranzi Kumarajas is like caravans, caravans. He is moving place to place, moving place to place.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.920
 Many times, Ranzi Kumarajas style, whatever he stay in one area, whatever he got, whatever received

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.000
 from the donation or the blessed offerings or that,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.100
 he leave that, to give that to that area, he go with just him or with the student to other places

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.000
 and start kind of new things in a way, new completely.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.010
 So there is nothing he is holding. That is very renowned in the debate called "Pumda". Pumda means

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.000
 everything give way, give way and move to the other places.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.050
 So he does that. In the teachings, Ranzi Kumarajas is already so poor. When he came, Ranzi Kumaraj

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.000
as was born in a poor family and when he was also growing up,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.210
 he has a lot of difficulties to maintain of his studies. And when he came to Ranzi Kumarajas, also

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.000
 he don't have much. He is quite poor. I am poor.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.950
 So when he master's moving place and giving everything and don't give has any more difficult in the

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.000
 teachings, more difficult to be with the teacher.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.380
 But yet, his courage and commitment and devotion, he stayed. Six years, Ranzi teaches. So he

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.000
 teaches and all that teaches.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.340
 And that is how content will be courage and commitment. Not just that kind of like content, "Oh, I

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.000
 know I have got this." And then he says that.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.120
 And that is also good. But however, if we like to really improve, we have to be content, delicately

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.000
 content and practice.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.360
 And they read that, for example, those all goryazoki masters, for example, Jimin was those students

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:44.000
, those all, really, one apron that is so humble, so simple, so white, so don't eat earth.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.320
 But yet, they worship them and compare them. It is just brilliant as a son. Really, all those jimin

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.000
 triyas, jimin jyawala, all one apron other.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:08.070
 They also contact with the great master jimin. And their master paparoon, he contracts with all.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.000
 Again, we find his teacher, particularly, he observes that teaching into the heart and practice.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And then he is one of the foremost disciple of the paparoon, was known as Nyokilunku.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.570
 Again, so great master, really, full of love, full of compassion, full of knowledge, full of

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:33.000
 experience, peace in the practical common sense and don't eat earth.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.100
 Humble, simple, and respect and appreciation to everyone. I mean, we need a large story of those

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.000
 when we heard story from the other great masters about those students.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Those are known as, once you find a qualified teacher and a contractor.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.370
 And now, we talk about the qualified teachers. What means qualified? Generally, qualified teacher,

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.000
 unqualified teacher.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 All spiritual friends and negative friends. Negative friends.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 What that is generally clearly distinct by, again, we say, two friends, good friend and bad friend.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 A good friend is a spiritual friend and a bad friend is negative friend.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.120
 What is said? And when you contract with first ritual with a negative friend, what a great master

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.920
 just told me, what he told me, he said in his 37th, I mean, you all have that books too, you can

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.000
 read.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:50.810
 You can read very powerful instructions, all these things. He said, when you contract with whom you

00:09:50.810 --> 00:10:00.000
 contract, as I translated, when you contract, it will increase the three poisons.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.900
 Ignorance and attachment and anger, it will increase the three poisons. At the same time, it will

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:22.000
 decrease all the virtuous activities, good activities, beneficial activities, practical activities,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 common sense activities.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.440
 It reduces. And to get with dharma, such as it will reduce your time to study dharma and

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:43.000
 contemplate dharma and meditate dharma on the meaning, it will reduce the dharma.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:57.940
 At the end, it will completely vanish it, vanish it, loving kindness and compassion, complete

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.000
 vanish it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.330
 If that individually is known as negative friend, whoever that is, if we contract with that, if

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.000
 that does, therefore, we should be thoughtful.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.940
 Even if we have similar kind of friend, they love us, they do that, but we have to be very

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.000
 thoughtful, have the strength, inner strength, inner strength.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Strength, so we are not completely kind of overpowered by that. And then, also, we lose our goal.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.750
 And in some ways, also, it will be unbeneficial to that person too. By the compassion, by both each

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:45.000
 other, we have to get inner strength. Strength when you receive this.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.090
 This is, and that is so many stories. When the negative friend is identity, very influential, very

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.000
 powerful, influential in the samsara in our lives.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Really, it is very powerful. It will change directions, directions.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.780
 And there are so many stories that those unspirited friend or negative friend change the directions

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.000
 in the Buddha teachings.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 So many of them, not just the Buddha teaching, we know, we know that.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.910
 And that, so many poets, I mean, young kids in school are spoiled by their friends, and then they

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.000
 lost their life.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.290
 Really, in a way, they are losing lives, all these beautiful things, losing and completely kind of

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.000
 carried with the post.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And then, meaning of life is completely devalued, valued and become almost kind of useless.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And then end, when everybody ended with tragedies, how would that happen? This happens.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And on the other hand, then spiritual friend.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Spiritual friend. And what again this great Master says.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.660
 I mean, if we do that, what we do, trying to connect with inner strength and be strong with those

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.000
 un-conveller and un-virtuous friend everywhere.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Then, that is, in the teachings, that is practicing of the bodhisattvas.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 That is practice of bodhisattvas. This is not negatives.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 That we are doing something good for you, and it will be good for them too. It benefits us.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And the next one is then the spiritual friend.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.710
 What does the community say? Through whom you contract to that individually, it will bring all the

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:39.000
 good qualities as like vaccines.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:53.290
 It will increase as like vaccines, and then it will bring all the studying, understanding and

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.000
 knowledge.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Knowledge also begins to shine beautifully.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And also it reduces all the negatives. I mean, it begins to devalue the negatives.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.090
 One who also contact with that, then all the practices such as studying, meditation and conveller,

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.000
 all that will increase.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.260
 That is known as spiritual friend. In these teachings, when you found that kind of friend, you

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.000
 should keep that friend as dear as your life's lives.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.210
 Keep that as dear or precious as your life's lives. And instead, that is practicing of the bodhis

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.000
attvas.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So those are generally the importance of the negative spiritual friend and unspiritual friend.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Now we go to the qualifications of the teachers.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Generally, the qualification of the teachers taught by bodhisattvas in so many places, according to

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 every kind of divided into three.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Hinayana, Sutra Mahayana, and Vayayana Mahayana. If you come and summarize with that.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And Sutra Mahayana, oh sorry, Hinayana, qualified teacher, there is many again to summarize that.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 To summarize, there is known as three qualifications.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Three qualifications are principal, which is, in a debate, tenki pampayori.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Ten means stable, kiwi means expert, and pen means beneficial. So that is really neat.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:14.250
 Stable means what? According to the Hinayana teaching, that teacher or spiritual teacher have the

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.000
 good moral conduct,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:26.040
 moral conduct or stable moral conduct, that is at least, there is nothing, nothing stand for at

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.000
 least ten years.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So at least, the least and then more is great. So stainless, quite good conduct, quite good conduct

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 or quite good moralities,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 moralities, moralities, and that is known as stables, or even ten years, at least ten years.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 And then, second is expert. Expert means teachings of the Baladhanas.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And teachings of the Baladhana, such as Vinaya, Sutra, and Abhidhana, expert.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And expert has two experts, expert of the scripture and also somebody expert of the realizations.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:31.150
 The scripture means knowledge, generally knowledge of the, such as Vinaya teaching, Sutra teaching,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.000
 and Abhidhana teachings, some knowledge.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 That is known as in the Buddha teaching, "longge chu" and in a debate, "longge chu".

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.530
 I translate it as "scripture". And then, "pupu chu" is realization, that Buddha teaching is not

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.000
 just a teaching only for the intellectual,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 but it is teaching for the realization, for practices. What is the practices?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.380
 Practice the meaning of that teaching, that observe in heart and mind some degree development, some

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.000
 degree development to that individual.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:22.450
 So, in that level, again, for example, the realization of the three basket teachings always said, "

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.000
morality, concentration, and resistance".

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:36.720
 Those are also known as, in the Buddha teaching, three extra ordinary training practices, morality,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.000
 concentration, and meditation.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.680
 So, some degree that individually is not just only kind of knowledge of the brain, but also that

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:56.000
 those all observe in the heart, mind, and some degree to that realization.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Understand, keep up that.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:09.720
 And the third one is, then, beneficial. And also, that individually, it has quite a good amount of

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:16.000
 compassion, loving-kindness, caring, and concerning thought to the others.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.990
 And also, patient, patient, help with that. Those are really, I mean, there are many more to you,

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:35.000
 but those are similar, really qualification of the "ashenyana" teachings, "henyana" teachings.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.680
 And "mayana" teaching is best on that, the qualified teaching, is best on "henyana". Same thing,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.000
 same thing, I think it's really difficult to speak that way.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.410
 But above that, what is teaching? It says, again, "mayana", to have that, again, morality, or keep

00:19:53.410 --> 00:20:01.350
 both each other, worry strongly in that heart, or that qualified teaching, with those what is

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.000
 listed in "henyana".

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And above that, good compassion, good compassion.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And also, have great knowledge of the body, both "mayyana" teachings, "mayyana" teachings.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And always have the courage and the commitment and the patience to help other beings. And always

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 also available, quite available, available when needed, available.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Those are some qualifications of the, again, really, the "mayana" teachings.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:56.010
 So this means, the individual who has those qualifications, then they are quite qualified teachers,

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:01.000
 teachers to contact them, to contact them.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Then, in the "mayana" teaching, qualification is again the same, is best upon the same thing.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.280
 But that teaching is not just three different groups, and then you completely keep up one after

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.000
 another.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 But all is lined up. All is best upon one after another. Another is all connected.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.430
 So now, when you have this, so that means "mayana", sorry, "henyana", "mayana", "sutra-mayana"

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.000
 qualification.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.950
 And now, above that, what is in "mayana" teaching? Teaching said, again, one who keeps the old Sam

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.000
ayas.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Morality is known as in "mayana" teaching, known as Samayas.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And "sutra-mayana" is as known as, I think, vows, vows.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.500
 And then, in the bodhisattva, also in "henyana", morality, I think. Those are different terminology

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.000
, but it's the same meaning.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 There's nothing big difference, please.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 So now, Samaya, quite, okay. Now, Samaya is very energetic teaching.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Samaya is larger, deeper, so that means more.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And then, this Samaya is generally very energetic teaching.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.020
 Samaya, I think many of you all know, is best, kind of like, summarized in the five dhyana-buddha

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.000
 Samayas.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Five dhyana-buddha Samayas.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Within the five dhyana-buddha Samayas, then all those "henyana", "mayana" was also included today.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 It's really all included. It's all coming up, all coming in the "mayana" teaching.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 And those, I will just list those names.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 For example, first is the Samaya of the Buddha families.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Sometimes the Buddha family is also known as "tathagada" families, or "devishya" parents.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Buddha families, Samaya is what? The "moralities".

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 "Moralities" is the whole morality, what is mentioned in the "henyana" and "mayanas".

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 In "mayana", morality is divided, as you know, three, right? Three.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 And morality that will prevent all the negativities, and that is one.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Second, morality that will increase all the good activities.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Oh, sorry, maybe this increases, but morality, that will gather all the good activities.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 So that is second, and third is morality that will make beneficial to all the living beings.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 That morality, that three, is Samaya of the Buddha family.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Above that, rafuddhi and bodhicata are above that.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 So they mean three, five.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 So, Buddha family Samayas are the three moralities, rafuddhi and bodhicata.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 So, that is Buddha families.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 And then, rafuddhi, rafuddhi families, Samayas are keeping up the skill to meet the Muslims.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Keeping up the skill to meet the Muslims.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Combined with that, with that, what is called, with that, Buddha family Samayas.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Keeping up the skill to meet the Muslims.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 To symbolize even that, say, teaching, keep the bell, and the dojis, dojos.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But that is Samayas.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And above that, rena sama family or rena families, morality is above those two.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Above those two Samayas doing all the generosity practices.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Generosity practices.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Generosity, giving, giving, giving those, all the things.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 That is what I was called.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Rena families practice, rena family Samayas.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Above that four, above that three.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 And then, bhema families keeping up all the teachings, honoring all the teachings.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 So that included the Hinayana teaching, Mahayana teaching, all the Vaidyana teachings.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 That is bhema families, Samayas.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Above that, what?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Above that, then Samayas of the Amogasalas family or Ganga family

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 is performing all the commitment, what you said I will do.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Keeping up all the practice, keeping up all the values.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 What we said we will keep, we will do when we receive the teaching,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 when we receive the empowerment, when we receive instructions.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Keeping our commitments.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Commandments and the plus, then, not kind, then keeping up, also like timely practices,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 such as 10th day practices, Nakini practices.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 And then plus, whatever you are committed to do, kind of keeping up the walls,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 walls at the same time, trying to help other beings.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Those are known as karma families, Samayas.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 So now, with this, this, then, so they are here.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Again, all that, I just said that, but with that courage,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 when you find this qualified teacher, teacher,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 then with joyful effort and with courage and commitment, keep up that.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Keep some of that.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And as, again, those read life story of the great master,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Anjiba, Malareba, and all those girls have really been maintained

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 and kept up and counted that qualified teacher with full of joy and devotions.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 This.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And when you receive that, then, and of course, in the Zouki teaching, Samayas,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 known as, then, what?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Of course, the Zouki Samayas, again, really known as 27 Samayas,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 which is related with the root teachers.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 27 Samayas.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And then, the one also where you kind of summarize that in a way,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 those are known as the poor Samayas.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 poor Samayas are,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 and they need to be, to be Mepa, means not exist.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 And so maybe I will use that.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 North, North Samayas,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 pervasive Samayas,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 one Samaya,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 and spontaneously inherited the Samayas.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Those are poor, famous Samayas.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 And North Samaya means in the Zouki realization,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 everything is, is Rupa.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Everything is within the Rupa.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Nothing is outside of the Rupa.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 When we keep maintaining the Rupa,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Rupa or the three awareness, Rupa states,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 exactly as it is, there is nothing to keep Samayas, this and that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 In it, there is nothing.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 All is displayed.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Actually, when we keep the awareness,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 when we maintain the awareness, then there is no Samayas.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 For that reason, no Samayas.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 And the second is pervasive Samayas.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Pervasive Samayas mean when we,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 when we have the realization of the Rupa,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 when you have this Rupa realization,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Rupa is not just selected one in it.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Rupa is pervasive.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Rupa is as far as space goes.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 That far is Rupa.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Ever knows.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And for that reason, what great master Garabdoji said,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 my father always said those things to me in my age.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Said, said that what Garabdoji said.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Sentin means mind or soul pieces, kind of small, small pieces.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Buddha mind is pervasive as sky.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Buddha mind is Rupa.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Rupa is pervasive.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 What is Rupa?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Rupa, we talked so many times.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 We read books, talk about it.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 It's three kaya.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 So three kaya is not just a small ICBC 180 in my heart or your heart.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 It's pervasive nature.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Everything is in three kaya, three.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Narmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 In that reason, all the Samayas rules and regulations,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 whatever, is three kaya.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 There's nothing to really hold, nothing to select, nothing to reject.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 It's all three kaya states.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 It's pervasive.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 For that reason, pervasive Samayas.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And the third one is Samaya of one.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Samaya is one.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 And that is again, same thing about the Rupa.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 When you discover the Rupa, you discover everything.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Everything.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Everything.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And the Rupa is pervasive politics.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 So there's not just a many these and that.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 When you discover the Rupa, you discover everything.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 And all the Samayas, all that merge in one Rupa status.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 As you say in the teaching said, 100 rivers went under one bridge.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 100 rivers went under one bridge.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 One realization, Rupa completely transcendental, all transcendental, all big.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Everything has three kaya states.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 So there's nothing really to go up in each other.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 It's one, one Samayas.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 And the next one is a spontaneously inherited Samayas.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Inherent.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 That means when you are again is similar, but looking at different angles.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Again, all these realizations, all these Samayas and all these,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 is all holds in the Rupa status.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Rupa status.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 In the teaching said, general how that is explained.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Teaching said, when you got the Rupa, realization of Rupa,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 when you discover the Rupa, when you discover the awareness,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 exactly as it is, that individually never perform any negativity activities

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 that go to the others, to the others and to yourself.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 When you not doing any negative activities, naturally that will complete

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 all the Hinayanas, Samayas or vows or the Morales.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 When you have that realization of the Rupa, naturally that person will perform

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 all the beneficial activities.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 That also indicates, joking practitioners, all great bodhisattvas,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 they perform all the beneficial activities.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 When you have and not going to do any negative activities

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 and going to all the beneficial activities with realization of the Rupa,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 freely, openly, you begin to do.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 And when you perform all the beneficial activities

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 to all the sentinel beings, that completes all the essence of the Mahayana vows.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Mahayana vows, complete, inherited within them.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 When you not doing any negative activity and perform any beneficial activities

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 and then that will keep practicing.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 See everything as in the three kaya status, three kaya status.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Everything is in three kaya status.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Kaya state and therefore then you are keeping everything as,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 as exactly where it is, see that.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And what is Samaya, what is the teaching said?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 What the great master known in the Yimat school,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 very famous master, you know, I think his book is translated to his,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 this Maripendha, very famous master and this,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 he wrote a very famous book known as Three Vows.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Three Vows, which is, then his own religion also commented on that vow

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 and which is translated into English.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 English.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 At the end, he said all the Samayas, everything is explained everything.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 And what he said, and how he summarized.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 He said in brief, if you see all the three doors are three various status,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 all the Samayas are completed within them.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 If you see three doors are three various status.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Three doors, three you know, you know.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 The body, speech and mind.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 If you see these three doors are the three various status,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 then every, hundreds and millions of,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 hundreds and millions of Samayas are completed within them.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Three doors is of course our body, speech, mind.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 But not just only our body, speech, mind.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 The form, song, speech.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 All those are three doors to you.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 When you see that as three way,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 whether, whether body, whether song or Buddha,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 enlightened poem, enlightenment speech,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 enlightenment space, if you see, then there's nothing wrong.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Nothing is right and wrong hold is the enlightened, enlightened status.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 And similarly here,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 simultaneously inherit the Samayas.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 You have that realization, then complete.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 The other one in the teaching said, what the great master again,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Adi said one time, said,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and I think one of his students, Dom Tamba, I think,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 and he asked, Dom Tamba asked, asked to Adi, he said,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 master, when will you not perform the negative activities,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 when you got the realization of the true nature of emptiness?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 He said, when we will stop the negative, or the negative activities.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Negative, what do you...

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Yeah, I think that's it.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 When we stop the negative activities,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 we really got the realization of emptiness, emptiness.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 And Adi just said,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 when you got the realization of emptiness at that same time,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 compassion is right there.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 Compassion and emptiness realization comes as one baggage.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 It's not just compassion comes in upper world,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 or compassion comes before.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 When we have the post-Boomi realization,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 for example, every talk, Boomi level,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 post-Boomi realization, that moment,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 you have the great compassion as post-Boomi.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 For those reasons, when you have the great realization

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 of the true nature of the mind,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 that moment, the great compassion, is also shining, shimmering.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 So compassion is not something that comes later,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 or we don't have the compassion.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 This is the nature, the nature of the mind,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 clarity and the nature of the mind.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 What can be is token. That's how the realization comes.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 And then, of course, now, this is all I mentioned, token.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 This time, what is our main practices?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 As we do, tattoo practices, tattoo.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 And then we are going in these texts, great, unique.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And this is quite big.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 You see, I'm just showing this.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 So maybe you're looking at something,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 all those different life things, all those things.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 So it's going to come slowly.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 It's not coming.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 But in the teaching, you see, really,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 the first is so important, tattoo.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And not just of tattoo is important.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 When we practice a toggle, we have to maintain a tattoo.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Within that tattoo, we're going to practice toggle.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And we don't have the tattoo realization

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 and practice toggle.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Then it becomes not good enough.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 All this is become almost, we're kind of looking

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 to another grasp, another clean.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 And it's not become refined.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 So toggle practices must be best upon the tattoo.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And the tattoo practices must be accompanied

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 by all the time within toggle practices.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Otherwise, it is just another conception, this place.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 It could come, that.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 So therefore, every teaching said,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 tattoo is so important.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Without the tattoo practices,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 toggle won't make toggle.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Or toggle without the tattoo practices,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 and the tattoo won't be leaping over.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Leaping over in one instance, it's said.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 From the duality world, leap over to the enlightenment state,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 or Buddhahort.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 But without the tattoo practices, it won't leap over.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Leap over because we still hold back by the dualities.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 So then it's not really become successful.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 So therefore, tattoo is so important,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 we continually practice it.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 And then, I mean, it has many.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 So it won't become easy.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 I just follow with this teaching.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Gradually, we have quite a while to go.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 And I just thought to tell you,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 but we are really making good preparation,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 good foundation for the toggle.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And we are heart of the Buddhasamadabhadas.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Buddhasamadabhadas.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 And that is what the tattoo is.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 Tattoo is.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 So with great joy, with great devotion,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 and great enthusiasm,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 and then we continue the practices,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 and then the light will come.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 [Laughter]

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Light is already here.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 There is something welcome.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 But also, excitement, light is welcome.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 We have some questions we will discuss.
