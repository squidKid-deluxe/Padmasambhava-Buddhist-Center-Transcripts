00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 It can be translated as "Cause Samadhi" or "Seat Samadhi", "Seat Samadhi".

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 What is this? It is the union of suchness and all arising Samadhi, triggered.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 Now it appears to be more active, more tangible forms that we can hold on the duality mind.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:42.280
 And that is, in a case, the seed syllabus, that often you heard that and you practiced this, so

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.000
 seed syllabus.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 Seed syllabus, what is, is the combination of the skull remains and the western target.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 All is the combination of the most subtle wind energy and our awareness target.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 In a debate, the teaching is long simple, the subtle wind and as well as our now awareness,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.700
 before suchness, all arises Samadhi, our awareness, as it is, is pervasive status, very pervasive

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 status,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.200
 and the infinite vastness status. Now we are, in one way, we are gathering, gathering, even

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 awareness is nothing changed,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 but based on that we are now going to focus more localized, more centralized, and that is the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 essence, the most subtle,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 the most finest state of our consciousness or the awareness and the wind.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 That subtleness appeared in the form of syllabus. So syllabus is nothing but wind and consciousness

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 or the awareness of our self.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 And that, what is that? That is, then, skull remains, bhassala, or that means compassion and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.500
 emptiness, target.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.330
 You want single status. This syllable can be small. Of course, you can visualize bigger, but

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.500
 generally say small, small.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 That appeared as instantly as a rainbow in the sky. Just instantly appeared.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 And even though it is a subtle consciousness and subtle wind energy combined together,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:01.390
 the way is appeared instantly in your mental state as rainbow light in the sky, sky, and that is

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 what it is.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:13.480
 This is the most important. This is, the one way is sub-nicular, sub-nicular of your enlightenment

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.500
 or our enlightenment.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 This is now going to blow up all the mountain of habit patterns.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:32.850
 This, therefore, is really the atom of the most powerful nucleus that begins right in our heart, in

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.500
 mind states.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 And if we have time, again, we are going to meditate in that status.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 For three seconds, three minutes, just really that.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Generally, this is not the time we talk. We like to have good concentrations.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.500
 We like to have good meditate. This is the really where you start.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.500
 This whole practice is not something that we're doing extra here, that is, distorted.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 We are doing exactly the heart, the root, the very best of the meditation, meditation practices.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500
 So we're talking about the time, this and that, but this is really the practice.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 Every concert, every person spends some time with this.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 This is the most powerful way of concentrating.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:33.500
 Shama, Vibhachan, all what we name it is very powerful way to build up, stabilize our meditation.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 And this is what we should let it. This is all union of compassion and wisdom.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 It's so wonderful, so special and a relaxed mind to that status, properly.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 Second or three minutes, whatever you have to spend.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.500
 And then, this is what it does in the teaching set.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.500
 Also, it will purify habit patterns of the birth becoming.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.500
 It will purify habit patterns of the birth.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 And birth is the way to begin, again, whole cycle.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 Cycle goes on and on as spirals, unending, until we reach the enlightenment.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 Even when it's the enlightenment, concurrently it moves.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
 This is about things according to the teaching set.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:39.500
 So birth is the beginning of another chapter of the whole universe, whole vision.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
 So when we take care of that very beginning,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.500
 then it will take care of all the other motions, the unfolded, rolling motions.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500
 That's why it's so important.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.500
 Also, this realization on the siddhi samadhi and of meditation on the siddhi samadhis.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 It will purify that in the teachings.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 Then in the teaching, also it will purify more kind of larger scope level.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500
 It will purify the habit patterns of the desirums.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 Desirums are in the teaching set. There are three realms.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.500
 Desirums, poem-brain, and poem-less realms.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.500
 Poem-brain is more gross level.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.500
 Gross level. We all are in poem-rains.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.500
 No, sorry. We are all in desirums.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.500
 Desirums are more gross, tangible. That's what we are.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:53.500
 But poem-brain, poem-less realm is semi-poems.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 In a way, twilight zones between desire realm and poem-less realm.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:13.500
 It's more kind of like simi. Simi-status. Right? Simi-status. It's okay.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.500
 We are simi-status. Then poem-less realm is poem-less.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.500
 That's it. It has no forms. It's completely out of the forms.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500
 That actually also corresponds in the teaching set with ours.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.500
 What we are now. For example, desire realm is more representing our body.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.500
 Physical body is represented as desire because it's more tangible.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500
 Tangible-ness is desire realm.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:53.500
 And then our speech, our voice, is like poem-rains.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:01.500
 Voice, the speech, is simi, is a poem, but also is not really as form as physical.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.500
 Physical. So this, the form more corresponds, or the body corresponds with desire realm.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.690
 And we are trying to apply it to our, this body is miniature of the world in one way, or this is

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.500
 the world.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 So the poem is desire realm. Our speech is the poem-brain. Our mind is formless realm.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:36.000
 Formless realm. So in that way, that way, then again these three samadu will also purify those

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.500
 different habit patterns.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:52.080
 And now what, after when we purify that habit patterns of the birth, whatever does, then birth also

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.500
 will become as magical birth.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:06.420
 All those great masters born with the awareness, take consumption with the awareness, born with the

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.500
 awareness, do work with the awareness,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:19.100
 and live more with the awareness. Not on the presumption status, not on the blind status, not on

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.500
 the expectation status,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:30.610
 and not on the unsure status. They're all in awareness. Come with the knowledge, live with the

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.500
 knowledge of Vasudan,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.500
 save with the knowledge, and live more with the knowledge in Vasudan.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.500
 Those all also begins really purifying these habit patterns.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:51.950
 Therefore, I mean, it's all connected. That's why in the teachings, they're all connected, inter

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.500
dependent, co-ordination.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.500
 There's nothing, one single object, that which is not connected.
