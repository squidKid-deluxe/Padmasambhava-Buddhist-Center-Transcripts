00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 "Again, more and more highlighted, everything, all the, every good things, both in the samsara and

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.100
 nirvana, it comes from the intelligence, the wisdom, every good things in the samsara and in the n

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.100
irvana, it works, and to explain of this, the wisdom, then there is again, the first part, how we

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.180
 started this great intelligence, the wisdom.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.340
 This is, again, and in this, again, there is two things, in the good things, in the samsara

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.650
 goodness and in the nirvana goodness, both, the, the souls of both, both, is best on our

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.680
 intelligence, our own intelligence, our good.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.200
 This is also known as perfect understanding, perfect understanding of the samsara and perfect

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.180
 understanding of the nirvana natures, also true natures. These are two.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.230
 And the first is perfect understanding of the samsara, samsara natures. That means that we are in

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:19.110
 the samsara, because the nirvana is, is best on the good, nirvana is best on the good, good will

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 and the good understanding of the samsara.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.050
 So therefore, samsara is where we are now, but because of the, because standing and understanding

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.200
 the perfect understanding of the samsara natures, then we will reach to the nirvana states, nirvana

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.180
 states.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 So therefore, therefore, and again, so here, the perfect understanding of the samsaras.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.750
 If we want, if we don't want the enlightenment, or if we don't want to get also good situation in

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 samsara, then we don't have to follow these systems, we don't have to follow.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.830
 But if we like to have something decent, good things in the samsara, for a mean time, for a while,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.560
 or at the first places, and then eventually we like to get good results as nirvana results, then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 the first one is we have to really also believe, or we have to follow where the law of the natures

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.680
 are, where the law of the natures.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.910
 Natures are what? Externally. Everything what we do is reflected back to you, that reflect back to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.180
 you, or it produces that. Everything that produces, there is nothing escaping.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.180
 If there is perfect cause, perfect convictions, the resolve inevitably comes.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:53.660
 This is just logic, this is only sense, understanding. When we plant the seed, there is result

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.180
 comes, result or the fruit comes, and we take care of that, and there is that will come.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.280
 And we don't do, it won't come. And so therefore, with that understanding, standing, we should do

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 decent, good things.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 If we want to be happy, enjoying this lifetime, time, we should do good things, good things.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.180
 Because of good, that will bring good result, good result. That is what it says.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:32.470
 So therefore, and then deep down, also law of karmas, and trusting and believing on the law of karm

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.180
as.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.180
 Karma is something that, of course, there is quite a few different karmas.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 Some karmas are old, but immediately you can see in these lifetimes.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.910
 Some karmas may be next life, some karmas could take a long time to make sure that, surely, but no

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.180
 matter how long it takes, it will surely mature, mature to that.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180
 There is no relief to that. But how?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.950
 So sense, even though we don't see immediately that result, but the karma, law of karma is so

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.180
 important to believe.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.180
 If we believe in the nirvana, nirvana is what we are not going to get immediately in this lifetime.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.180
 Maybe we will get the drone of nirvana, the light of nirvana, nirvana, but not immediately that.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.190
 Nirvana, as such as Buddhahood, enlightenment, won't come immediately unless really we are a great

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.180
 meditator of that.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 But if we do good activities, good activities, definitely that will bring the bridal, and the br

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.180
idal, and the bridal.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:52.420
 So therefore, this is where, again, I think I should translate it, maybe roughly this, this, but

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.180
 that.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:09.320
 So again, yeah, maybe, so roughly translation, if we want to get the good things in this lifetime,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.180
 in the nirvana, or the higher realization, or the enlightenment,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:23.180
 then definitely we should always be and learn and be, have the good will and trust is that.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.220
 And even if you don't have the path of the will and trust is, even if you do good activities in

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.180
 this lifetime,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.180
 since you don't have the good will, really at the best, that won't bear the good result.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.280
 It's almost like, it's almost like doing kind of wrong directions, in a way. It really spoils that

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.180
 entire thing.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:53.180
 So therefore, we should always, always have that. If we can, we have to shoot always good will.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.010
 With that good will and good trusty and good belief in the way the spiritual will tell, and then do

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.180
 the good activity,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.000
 it will be more strong because your intention, your action, all are lined up exactly in that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.180
 direction.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.180
 So therefore, it will be better fruit, good, more result, powerful ways.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.180
 That's what this great Master's explain.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 And then, the next one.
