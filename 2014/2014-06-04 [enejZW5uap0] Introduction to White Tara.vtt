00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 And now, as you all know, I'm going to offer the involvement of the White Tara.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 And before I begin, the involvement of the ceremony, and I'm going to give pre-introduction.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Introduction is a part of the ceremony and part of the lineage teachings,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 so that even though you already know that I'm going to give the White Tara empowerment there,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 but it's, again, as a lineage instruction, to strengthen our understanding, knowledge as much as we

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 can,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 so that we can absorb teaching, empowerment, and a blessing within our heart-statement with joy,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 with devotions.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 For that reason, I will bring it, again, into darkness.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 The first of all, again, it is the involvement.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 The involvement of this teaching comes from, again, of course, by Buddha Shaptamani,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 who came about 600 years ago in India, and Buddha was totally enlightened beings.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 That means, what means enlightened beings?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 In Buddhism, enlightened beings, one who is free from all the obscuration and negative emotions,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 such as ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, heady thought, self-important greed,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 and vileness, peace, and thoughts, totally, totally removed, totally free.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Buddha's, his thought, his mind, his realization, wisdom is utterly love, kindness, compassion,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 and wisdom combined, together, with peace and joy for all living beings.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 We don't have any discrimination.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Love, kindness, compassion, respect, and appreciation to every living being.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Even Buddha, we know as Buddha, is totally enlightened.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 He is the super of super beings, in a way, among the old human beings,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 because his realization is understanding, but yet, he is so humble, so respectful,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 so appreciative to everyone, everyone.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 This is what the teaching is.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 That is what the practice of realization is, kindness, compassion, respect, and appreciation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 So this great teacher gave or shared so many teachings,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 as we are ready to connect to ourselves, to the teaching, so that we become as enlightened.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 That also means, Buddha taught in the teaching, that every living being is equal, include himself.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 He said, we are all equal, because we all have the same nature, same potential,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 same quality, is only the matter of the "vetted up" or not "vetted up".

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 That is the difference. Otherwise, everyone is the same, same.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So for that reason, in order to wake up ourselves, Buddha gave so many instructions

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 and teachings, that we can, according, we can connect today.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 In the context of love, compassion, worship, respect, and appreciation,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 and joy for men, happy men, and respected men, that we can explore

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 and become ourselves as one of the same as Buddha himself.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 So he gave many teachings.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 All those teachings are summarized according to the new mass schools of the great Buddhism,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 in the nine yanas, or nine different categories.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Among these teachings, there are seven, eight, and nine teachings.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Those teachings are known as in the new mass schools of the great Buddhism,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Mahayoga, Anayoga, and Athayoga, and many of you know and read books,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and see the teachings practiced in that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 So those are according nine yana level, nine different categories.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 This is the seven, eight, and nine teachings.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 So this teaching, what you're going to receive is taught by the Buddha Shakyam.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 That is Buddha's.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 When Buddha Shakyam will give these teachings, again, going back to his story, how that started,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Buddha gave many different, as I said, categories of teachings,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 as individuals and ladies.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And therefore, there are many different teachings.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And this seven, eight, nine, particularly these categories of teachings,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Buddha did not get open to public in that time to the Indian audience,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 because they are not needy.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 But they selected a group, and as well as numerous beings,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 in a Buddha's teaching, we call it celebrity beings.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Now, we're ready to resist these teachings.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Buddha expounded these teachings.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Last these three teachings, to all those normal beings,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 those in the way of ourself, what we call invisible beings.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 But they are not just, not beings, there's many beings.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 That even though our consciousness, I cannot detect it immediately.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 But there is beings in the Buddha's teaching.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So many beings.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 So Buddha gave these teachings on those levels.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And then, April Buddha's Mahabharata in the Rana, which means Buddha passed away in 881,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 or 80 passed away.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 April is Mahabharata in Rana, or past 81, and maybe 300 years.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And over that time, these teachings become very popular in India.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And particularly in the teachings, April is 27 years after the Buddha's Mahabharata in Rana,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 or the passed away, these teachings started coming to this world.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 They're ready to resist, practice it, and explore this, engage in these teachings.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 But however, it is very kind of like, very selective and personal kind of, in a way,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 very small amount of the practitioners.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 But even through a 300 years opera, teaching becomes very popular.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And then more populars.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Particularly such as a great master, a great master of Mahasambhava,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 who came 8 years after the Buddha's Shakyamuni,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 and then started expounding, hearing this, particularly this teaching,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 that had three last teachings of Nayayana, seven, eight, and nine teachings.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 It started really giving, as well as many great other masters.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 We want to be known as Mahasadas.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Mahasadas, Sanskrit word, which means accomplished masters.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 One who accomplished everything.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 That means one who complicated all the goals.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 What, why we don't accomplish the goals, our goal, our will?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Because there's so many hindrance, so many obstacles.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 The fundamental obstacle is a negative emotion,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 as we discussed in this morning, negative emotions.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Such as ignorance. What is negative emotions?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Now, but you know, few of them, maybe you don't hear that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 They all know immediately.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 But this negative emotion is the fundamental, is the ignorance.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Then attachment, then anger, then jealous, then hated thought.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 They are the Lakan, the chief cabinet ministers for our ego clings.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Ego clings is a big boss,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 staying in the center of the dominion and surrounded

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 by these chief six or five cabinet ministers.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And a different day, an appropriate day.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 And that is fundamental obstacles.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 A hindrance to our not fulfilling our goals.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Our goals.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 That's why the great master, his only Dalai Lama said,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 often he said, when you have the compassion,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 when you have the compassion, thinking of all beings,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 you fulfill your goals.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 When you're thinking of others with compassion,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 love and kindness, thoughts.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 That your goal will be a complicated worry.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Naturally, you don't implement big effort

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 because of compassion, powerful compassion.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 That's what it tells.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 The Buddha shocked the money.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 The one who shared his love and kindness and compassion

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 thought for all living beings and then for the goal.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 And similar, this master does, highly accomplished masters.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Complete the goal because they're utterly,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 completely rich of the love and kindness and compassion.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Thinking of all living beings.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Therefore, they vanished, they defeated this,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 the principle fundamental hindrance of our not achieving the goals.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 All the negative emotions transcendent within the state of love,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 compassion, wisdom, status.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 This is what called this Mahasadas.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 They shared these teachings continually

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 along with the European Masterbook.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So that's how this Buddha's teaching begins.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And among those teachings,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 then there are many different teachings, particularly.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And there are teachings about male Buddhas,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 female Buddhas, as well as Rādha Buddhas,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 priest Buddhas, same Rādha Buddha teachings.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Buddhas give many different teachings.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 These Buddhas, what the Buddha shocked

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 him when he gave the teachings on those different Buddhas,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 is not just the historian of the past.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 It's not the mythology of the past.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 But these Buddhas, according to Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 according to Mahasadas of those who are in the complicated,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 they are living Buddhas.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 These great Master Mahasadas, they contracted,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 communicated with these great Masters.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Where? In the different locations of the universe.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 This is our goal.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 We think this is the only one, a long one.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 That is, according to Buddha's teaching

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 and great Master's teaching,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 that is just very narrowly minded corners.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 We are looking only in the hole of the needle,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 the needle's hole, and that is what we see.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 When you look through the needle hole,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 eye of the needle, sorry, eye of the needle,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 what your vision will be.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 What our vision will be.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Our vision will be the eye of the needle.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 That is not what we are looking now.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 We are looking through the eye of the needle.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 We are listening through the eye of the needle.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Every hour senses like that shrink.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Because ego is clinging, this is the old emote.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 We are trapped as a cocoon.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 We don't penetrate, explore beauty in the panoramic view

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 of the 360-duty angles.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 We don't. Definitely, we don't.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 We don't.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And therefore, these living according to Buddha Shakyamuni

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 and all these great Masters,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 these Buddhas are the living Buddha.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Right now, right now.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And they are also representing and re-representing

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 our definite energies,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 our definite realization state of the mind,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 which is hiding behind the midst of these old obscurations,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 negative emotions.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 We conduct with these Buddhas as mirror images,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 or mirrors, mirrors.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And it will refine our beauty, our goal.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Goal. Goal.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 So that we can all achieve what our really true beings

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 and true magic it is.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And there are also Buddhas in Shakyamuni

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 give many different teachings on these Buddhas.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 They like this.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Among those Buddhas,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 and this today's teaching is then,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 as you all know, is white Dara.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Dara is according to the phenomena of the relative level.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Dara is considered as a human Buddha,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 living human Buddhas.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Dara has so many different emanations.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 That means so many different displays,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 according to the radial of the resilience,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 according to the radiance of the individuals.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So many different emanations.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Those different levels of the emanations in the Buddha's teaching

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 known as Dharmakaya Buddhas,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Sambokaya Buddhas, Nirmakaya Buddhas.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So many emanations.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Dharmakaya Buddha is absolute Buddhas,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 absolute Buddha beyond the conception.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 So that means beyond the grasping,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 beyond the ego cling,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 beyond the like attachment,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 beyond the clinging.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 This Buddha can be perceived.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 When we finish, when we vanish at our clinging,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 our grasping, our duality mind,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 we can clearly vision and see

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 this impossible Buddha of the Dara,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 the Dharmakaya Buddhas.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 That is the one, the Nirmakaya Buddhas.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 In order to behold this here nature,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 here nature simply meditates.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Now what have we done?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 How are we going to behold that nature of Dharmakaya Buddhas?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Simply meditating, relaxing in a Vibhachana state,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 all Jyotji states, all the Mahamadir state,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 relaxing that status,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 all the Pandyapara state, meditating, relaxing.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 That is what we are going to see,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 glimpse of her nature, her beauties.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 This Buddha, Dharmakaya Buddha,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 is also known as the Dara Buddha,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 now known as Mother of the Old Buddhas.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Buddhism says those who want to reach enlightenment,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 contract with the Mother of the Pandyapara Mother.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 She is known as Mother of the Pandyapara Mother of the Absolute Dara.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 And all the past Buddhas who reach enlightenment

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 become awakened, fully one,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 they contract and they absorb,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 they explore Mother of the Pandyapara Mother.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Those who want to reach enlightenment,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 walking for the path, they should engage and explore

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 the Mother of the Pandyapara Mother or Mother of the Absolute Dara.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Those who want to reach enlightenment in the future

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 or going to reach enlightenment in the future,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 they also should do the same thing.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 This is the Mother of the Old Enlightenment,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 not just selected groups.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 According to Buddhism, as many of you know,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 there are also many categories of the Realizations.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Those are known as the Sharvaka Yana,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Ahata and the Patea Buddhas, Bodhisattva,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 and the Bodhisaktamuni of Buddhas.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 All these Realization beings,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 everyone become Ahata, Patea Buddha, Bodhisattva,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Holy Buddha because contracting

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 and exploring the beauty of the Mother of the Pandyapara Mother,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Absolute Dara.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 That is what the power is.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Therefore, this state is known as the Mother of the Absolute Dara,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 the Darnakaya Dara,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 which is pervasive, totally beyond the conception,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 and yet it is the source of everything.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 It is the source of love, source of compassion,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 source of wisdom, source of understanding,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 source of skill, meaning everything is arising from that nature

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 without any discriminations,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 without any ideologies.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 That is the one known as the Rich of the Mother,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Absolute Mother Dara, the Darmakaya Dara.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 From that, that nature arises energy more,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 actually arises energy.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 That energy of love, energy of compassion,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 energy of the wisdom is known as then the Mother,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Sambokaya Dara.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Sambokaya Dara are most absolutely in the Buddha's teaching.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 They, those Dara, such as like Vaidyavaras,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Vaidyavaras, Vaidyoginis,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 and as well as the Five Dayana Buddhas,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and so called Five Pimal Dayana Buddhas,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 so called all are known as Sambokaya Buddhas.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 It sounds to me, what means Sambokaya Dara?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Totally enjoyment of the body.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 The component of the total enjoyment.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Something that component of the total enjoyment.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 There is nothing, anything that needs to be disregarded.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 It is abundance of the rich, abundance of the luxurious,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 abundance of the all the goodness.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 That is that richness, that God is known as that,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 that embodiment, that component, that is known as Gaya.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Gaya is a sense of old and can be translated as bodhi.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Bodhi or as translated, I am translated component, I think.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Component, I am translated, is collected.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 All collect, so many things, richness are collected.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Together, even there is nothing to be seen in different borders,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 all beautiful, harmonizedly rich in a way,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 coming out that glorious.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 That is the Sambokaya.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 What are those? Those are compassion.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 The infinite compassion, infinite love,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 infinite wisdom, infinite intelligence,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 infinite wisdom as I have listed this morning.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 The five, those wisdom.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 All those are, and those are also not just one,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 singly, narrowly, kind of like individually,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 connected these and that, five and things.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Each can be all of them, too.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 It's not just as kind of translated, but as we duality mind,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 this is, that's called beauty of the flexible and freedom.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Nature is freedom, total freedom and total vastness.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 It is openness, therefore dynamic display of the freedom,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 politics, arising energy can be anything

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 within these beautiful states of the five.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Vastams and those I call beautiful,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 call it love and compassion.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Vastams still means all of that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 That weakness is known as Sambokaya,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and those we did,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 even as the figures, forms,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 known as Varya Varayas, Varya Yogis,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 five Dayana Buddhas or five female Dayana Buddhas,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 so forth, in our conceptual level.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Those are named, those are.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 They are here, they are not just came and gone.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 They are known as the ongoing richness.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Therefore, Sambokaya called it five certainties.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Time is certain always because it went beyond three times.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 It went beyond the past, it went beyond the present,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 it went beyond the future.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 It's beyond three times.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Love and that weakness is continued,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 it's beyond the conceptions.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 That is the richness, that all the time,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 that what is in brewing with that.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 With that activity came,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 this Sambokaya energy component,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 more activity to communicate,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 engage with the duality of beings,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 the beings with duality,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 beings with emotions,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 beings with ego cleanings.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 When they appear, that component is known,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 or that display is known as Nirmakaya Buddhas.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 A Nirmakaya Buddha of the Tara is then,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 there is so many Nirmakaya Buddhas,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 such as, again, many different Ramakkati Buddhas

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 of the Nirmakaya Buddhas,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 and such as, Tara helps out as a Nirmakaya Buddhas, Tara.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Tara.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 And there is 21 emanations of Tara.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 We have beautiful Tara's images here,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 according to the lineage of the great master Jigme Lungpa.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 This Tara is a sovereign vibe with 21 talents,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 this old emanation,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 and blessed by our great Kenji,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Parthishara Nirmokchis,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 with his aspiration, with his blessings,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 with his lineage,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 put forward to these stages.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Stay right in front of me, please.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 This is all also known as Nirmakaya Buddhas,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 or the female Buddhas.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 What Nirmakaya Buddhas is the same quality,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 nothing changed,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 but is more accessible,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 more accessible to the beings of duality,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 because we cannot perceive the Sahagupaya Buddhas.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 And we cannot perceive immediately

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 the Nirmakaya Tara.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 But Nirmakaya Tara is something that we can communicate,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 we can receive, we can contact.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 That's what's called Nirmakaya,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 the playful, playful component.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 That one is playful.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 And to play, to our strength, to our ego, egos,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 our negative emotions,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 our duality, so that we can become as Tara herself.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 This emanation of Tara,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 then in the Tara, which is living Buddha Tara,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 this Tara, 21 emanation of Tara is according to Buddha,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 according to Guru Pramma Sambha,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 according to all those great Masters.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 From the time until now,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 so many great Masters really proceed

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 and receive the teaching directly from Tara.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 So this living Tara, this Nirmakaya Tara,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 this Nirmakaya Tara, living Tara.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And then also Nirmakaya Tara,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 emanation of Nirmakaya Buddha of Tara,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 appeared also many times in his world,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 as human points, really human points

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 within this, like, upper bodhisattva minutes.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 In many times, the teaching said,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Nirmakaya Buddha if Tara is according to again teaching,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 such as emanation of Nirmakaya Tara,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 are Buddha's mother, Maya Devi's.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Maya Devi is emanation of the Mother Tara.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And also, during the Buddha time,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 there is known as Gangathamas,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 the Devi of Ganges.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And there is a subtle of that.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And that is also known as emanation of Tara's.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 And then, there is, like I said,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 yes, all those five great Western Dakinis

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 who are the principle,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 the like, distributor,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 and the one who separated the teachings of the Vayayana

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 through Gharapaya Masambhava,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 from Gharapaya Masambhava,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 those are the Mandaravas,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 and the Kala Siddhi,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Shakta Devi, and Trasichini,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 and finally, as Isheen Swaraj.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Those are all known as emanation of Tara's.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Other 21, some of those emanation,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 of the different emanation of Tara's, Mother Tara's.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 And later, around 11 centuries, or the 12th century,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 greater Western Dakini famous one appeared in Tibet,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 known as the Māti-glāki-dronma,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Māti-glāki-dronma.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Now, they emanation of Tara,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and then, more and more, there is one after another.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Occasionally, not many as very renowned appeared

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 as those great masters,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 but so many great, really,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 female teachers who are emanation of Tara, Isheen Swaraj,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 appeared one after another.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 So many, they all recognized,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 and also even themselves said,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 emanation of Tara, emanation of Isheen Swaraj,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 emanation of the Māti-glāki-dronma.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Māti-glāki-dronma herself said,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 she said clearly, very once,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 that I was before as Maya Devi,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I was before as Gandhi Lamu,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 I was before as Suka Sri, Suka Siddhi, or Suka Siddhi,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 and I was before as a nugama,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 or the sister of the Naropa, great master Naropa,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and I was later in Tibet, he said,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 I was Isheen Swaraj, and now I am.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 That's what she said.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 So therefore, these emanations are renormal ones.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Then there are not just always a renormal one

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 as Māti-glāki-dronma or Isheen Swaraj.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 There are also many, those are very low-key,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 low-key emanations appeared,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 who were helping, supporting, guiding,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 and then to do all the beings,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 but not necessarily big names.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 There are so many female great beings, really came,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 and kind of after they did great work,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 and a great deed, and what they said,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and then in a way, they fulfilled their goal,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 and then they kind of left their voltage.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 There are also many of those beautiful stories,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 those things.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 So those are all the Dharmakāya Buddhas.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 So today, among all that,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 today we're connecting to the white Thar.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 White Thar is then, again,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 one of the emanations of the Thar.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Or, again, an emanation by the Buddhism teaching says,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 there are two principles, emanation of Thar,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 green Thar, white Thar,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 and this is white Thar.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 And also, the historian sometimes in the teaching said

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 that, "I will not get a short of it.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 I want to help to free all the sentient beings,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 sentient beings from the suffering,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 and the difficulty, and the troubles."

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And he did one time, two times, third time,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 third time, and again, there's almost like kind of come back,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 again, same amount as what he did before.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 So we kind of thought, what I can do,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 if it's so kind of in a way, in this regular way,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 that he will be upset, and he fell down, fell down,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 and it becomes kind of like, he becomes,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 he breaks himself and becomes so many pieces,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 so many pieces.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And Amitabha came, and don't worry,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 and his son, don't worry, this is the samsara karma,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 and the sentient beings are karma,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 and your compassion, your love will continue to help,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 and he put Amitabha put Throgada,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 and Amitabha resided on the ground of the Avalokiteshvara.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Ever sense that?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And this is just one of the stories.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 And then, Avalokiteshvara still came, the tears came.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Among those two tears, immediately appeared white Thar

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 and red green Thara, and said,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 "We will help you to support and live with all the sentient beings."

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So therefore, many times, also said in the teaching

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 that when we emanated from the tears of the Avalokiteshvara,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 or Buddha of compassion.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 So these are, I don't know what the story is,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 but it is that white Thara is the Buddha of now,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 living Buddha, and today, we are connected to that teacher.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So that is, but the white Thara is totally in light beings,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 full of love, conviction, wisdom, in the body of that volunteers,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 and free from all suffering and difficulty, trouble,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 negativity, that is what white Thara is, really that.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And now, this Thara teaching, or the entire Buddha's teaching,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 how that came,
