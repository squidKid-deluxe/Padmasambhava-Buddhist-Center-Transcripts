00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.040
 to that thought and moment you look that thought that instant and trying to find out where is that

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.360
 by this thought that which I don't like that thought and that moment then there is no existing

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:34.400
 that thought somebody it is empty thought and empty thought is empty whatever that is is empty

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.960
 there's no solid exist

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:01.520
 yes and now when you see this whether it is pleasing sound or unpleasant song

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:17.360
 both are nominated and designated name that by the mind and that is really the creation of the mind

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 and where is the mind

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:40.240
 so there is this is emptiness emptiness conception therefore is called illusion

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 illusion is therefore is called dreamland

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:08.000
 and every scholar like this emptiness again it is it's not just we're making up this

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.720
 emptiness or the buddha made up these things we look ourself where is our mind if we look to our

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.880
 trying to find our mind there's nothing to find we couldn't find find and that is known as

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 emptiness

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.560
 that is we just kind of is vaguely kind of believing oh I heard this emptiness

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.960
 that thought is known as then kind of like uh believing emptiness which is okay

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:59.360
 is not really true emptiness realizations or this is a called

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:10.240
 patched emptiness emptiness idea patched on the duality of mind mind so it's not really

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:19.040
 realization emptiness it is patched you got that from the buddha books or the books and then just

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.430
 patched on that your our duality mind so therefore I think it's called in the to bed it's called ji

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.920
endi

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:37.600
 but it is like patched or this is just the kind of you just holding that you just believed that way

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.000
 is not really our realization

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.520
 we don't have to be used as patched in our duality mind we can do ourselves find out is where is

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.760
 our

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.200
 mind that's a very simple way where is our mind and we may start looking where is this mind

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 and there's nothing to find we need to find that is known as that the emptiness is not the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 patched the emptiness realization of the emptiness

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.520
 when this is the same teaching

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.200
 again this is a teaching

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.320
 in that teaching said moment anger comes

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:02.720
 and in the in the teaching said the the raging anger comes in the mind

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.960
 instead of following or rejection accepted all these things instead of that immediately

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:21.120
 look to the direct press of the anger and moment you look there is a window of emptiness

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.880
 realizations and relax in that nature state we don't we don't uh we don't accept

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.840
 and applied in continually to every emotions

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:48.960
 anger attachment error and anger or all that one after another i mean that teaching applied

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:08.480
 and again we all know this is what is wrong what is mistake is following after these emotions

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:19.840
 like following after this attachment and that is then known as the only only and we lost it

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.840
 the purpose of the practices
