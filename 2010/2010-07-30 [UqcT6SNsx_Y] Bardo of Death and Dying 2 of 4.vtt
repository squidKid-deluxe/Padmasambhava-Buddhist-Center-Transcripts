00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.110
 "Peace, happiness, more soothing immoral and not destructive, not making parties there, not making

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 kind of talking about the different things of the subject that even is nothing related with that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.530
 person, just really stay quietly peaceful, except only supporting calm, peaceful, uplifting

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.000
 statement of those who say. Those are what we can do from family side."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Family side or friends, friends that we can do that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.800
 And then that individual, the person, one who is living, if they are practitioners, for example,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 such as like us, we are practitioners.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.400
 We have to now understand our practices, our meditation, our organization, our meditation, our

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.000
 concentrations, not worry and sad.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.630
 Sad. We have to be strong. We have to think. Time this world started, until now, there is no

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.000
 history to anybody's state forever. Everybody left.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Everybody also must be tried to stay, same way as we do. There must be a tribe, but no one ever to

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 stay. All left. Now, I'm following that highway.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.460
 So why I have tomorrow is nothing around me. And we just met all encouragement to your self. Then

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.000
 Buddhism both itself, the great beings, also that who I am not.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.130
 And with all thought, we strengthen our meditation, our practices, our visualizations, all both

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 each other, joy and appreciation.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And recollecting back all the good activities that you did in our lives, all in your lives.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.820
 Why? Whatever we did, if you remember that, I did that, kind of reaffirming, re-glorifying, I did

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.000
 the good things, I did that, this and that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Just strengthen your confidence with those good religious practices.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.070
 And at the same time, also dedicated those marriages. Whatever the marriage, whatever it has,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.000
 anything, I dedicated that to all beings.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 I offer to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, Gaurapayama, Sangha, Buddha, Amitabha.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.750
 All your personal close duties teach. And many times in the teaching said that you can, is the Amit

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.000
abha, is it?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Very special Buddha, because Amitabha has his own inspirations.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 In the previous life, when we go here, it's such a bodhisattva.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.580
 That time, he met such those inspirations, particularly those who are having scary with dying and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.000
 death or those who are going out of status.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.330
 And then our help and our support, and the moment they think, whoever thinks me, that I will be

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.000
 there and I will guide that all which might be your life.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And may that happen. Those statements don't happen. Not going to happen.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 May I'm not going to get enlightenment or may I should get enlightenment.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.560
 Many made those statements and many statement, as he made the statement, he fulfilled those goals

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.000
 in rich enlightenment.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And so, that's called the Buddha Amitabha.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 He's a very special Buddha after death and the dying, particularly when we are scared to be the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.000
 death.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.190
 And so, for that reason, the Buddha Shakyamuni taught a lot of teachings on the Amitabha that we

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.000
 all know.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.610
 He taught a lot of teachings on Amitabha, and many great masters ever since in Tibet have been

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.000
 practicing Amitabha all the time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Because this death is our next stage. It's just the next stage.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 No matter what age we are, it is our next level.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 It's the next level we have to go there.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So, therefore, always in the teachings said that we should always connect to Amitabha.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And not just ourselves, but others who are dying.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 It's not just the dying who are dying.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.600
 Right this moment, this moment, there's maybe thousands or millions, maybe really living their

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.000
 lives.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 So, have you prayed to thinking of those beings? Can you pray? And is it really that?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 It is also part of our bodhicata practice. It is good.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So, thinking of this, again, this strengthens our meditation in practices.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Those are always in the teachings said that maybe you are good to you.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.680
 I mean, you know that. It's a beautiful woman of Miss America, meaning she goes ready to go on the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.000
 stage.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 What does she do behind the scenes, or back side of the door, or other side of the door?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 She will look again herself in the mirror.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 The mirror sees if everything is okay and good and all.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And then she goes on the stage without any doubt or hesitation and she will become Miss America.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Similarly, we are going to that, on that sport, and before that we should be rehearsing ourselves,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 prepare ourselves, check up that, read that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.470
 This is practicing, generally the practicing is rehearsing. In particular, in that time, we

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.000
 connected our meditation.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 We are really rehearsing. We are ready to go on stage, or we are ready to parachute.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.380
 We are not going to parachute. I don't know which is good or not, but we are going to parachute

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.000
 upward.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Without any, what's it called, gravitas.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Gravitas. We are going to go up. That's it. We are going up without gravitation.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Gravitation is gone. We are going up.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 I said, look, the signal came to you.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So, this practice, thinking of those all is so important in the teachings.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.110
 We really should do those things, and we should support every practice, every son or friend member,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.000
 we should support those practices.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Nice, gentle, very peaceful respect manners that we should be happy to sound a member.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Not just the son or members, but even if they are not sound a member, we should be very gentle,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 peaceful, respectful, manning that we have to do that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And then, that is our spiritual side, spiritual practice.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.210
 And all this side, then we should also give up the attachment to our belongings, our wealth, our

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.000
 relatives, our friends, family members, all that.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 We should feel happy in the joy we spend the time with them.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 We did good things, and we've been wonderful. We did one of the things.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Now, I'm going to cut my glass, cleaning that.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I'm going to wish every good thing for them.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.570
 Not just only for them, but in the teachings said, I heard from the teachers, from his only

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:56.000
 religion, and as well as ofils that we should really make men out of us.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Everything, everything, your dearest belongings, dearest things, anything that you have.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.390
 Now, if you think I'm going to offer that to the Buddha Dhamma Sangha and to the Amitabha,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.000
 including my body, my son, I'm going to offer.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 So, you should really make very gigantic medallas.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Not just for one time, but think that again and in every way.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Many times, and let that offer. Once you offer that, then it's in a way, logically, it's theirs.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Therefore, I'm not going to attach it. I'm not going to clean it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Whatever that happens, that happens. Let that happen.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 I'm not going to think of any of those.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 So, with those thoughts, try to cut, grasp and clean these things.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And now, with that thought, again rehearsing practices.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And then, with that, that happens.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.190
 Now, when we begin to do that stages, and now, then, many different stages of science will come, in

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.000
 the teachings said.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Many different, because it's a graduation way, it's then, gradually, the science will come.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.440
 Those science, generally, in the teaching said, they started to post that what it does is it,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.000
 because now we have the whole of five chakras.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Grand chakra, sweet chakra, heart chakra, and narrow chakras, and then super chakras.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 According to the teaching, the first chakra is going to break the door, in a way, lose it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Of course, already everything, all, every system, is let a deteriorate, deteriorate.
