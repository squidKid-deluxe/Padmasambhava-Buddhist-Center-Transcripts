00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 This is what we are doing. It is aspiration prayers that we all know. Aspiration prayers, we are

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.790
 keeping our Buddhist practice, we are keeping ourselves on the path, path that we don't like to be

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.000
 interrupted.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.080
 As we learned in the teaching, path is one after another elite path, all Bumis, one after another.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.000
 We don't like to be interrupted our path or no Bumis.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.990
 This path in Bumis, Bumis is a Sanskrit word which means "stages." Stages. The stages in Bumis'

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:49.000
 path is not outside. It is all measured up our realizations, our inner developments.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.950
 So in the development, if we get enlightenment or Buddhahood within this lifetime of Dzogchen

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.000
 practices, then that's wonderful. That's wonderful. We prefer all of them.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 But somehow, we didn't prepare this. We like to continue to carry this kind of followed path step

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000
 by step in developing that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 And the two methods that show that happen is then having aspirations or doing the aspiration

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.000
 prayers. That really will make right on the tracks.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 So that's what we are doing. Each time we are doing this aspiration prayer, we call it the great

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.000
 master.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 But when we are taught here, we follow it. Besides, we do more aspiration prayers. Always we do. So

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 this is again, we go to now, to this.
