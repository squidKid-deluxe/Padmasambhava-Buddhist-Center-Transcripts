00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640
 As I said, I am as well as myself and a great opportunity, but many of you are great disciples of

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.000
 these great masters.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.800
 As I said, the Nyingma masters who came out of Tibet in 1959, I don't know anyone that has not

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.000
 become his disciples.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And also could be in Tibet. It was a long time in Tibet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 At the end of 1956 or '55, he stayed in Tibet. Could be his disciples.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 But definitely who came out of Tibet since 1959, almost everyone has become his disciples.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.100
 So if you contact any of those great masters, definitely you are also a great disciple of his Hol

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
iness Dudjom Rinpoche.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.250
 And he was one of the great teachers. I think many of you know and I think you heard, so I am not

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 going to show more than that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.030
 But he is one of the humble, simple, but yet totally great masters. He encompasses all the great

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.000
 teachers.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 This is the devotion of prayers, but also really it has a statement. It is true.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 The word "sanghe" is true. So, therefore, with that, all thought we praise.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And we do this in the niche too.
